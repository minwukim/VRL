Let $P$ and $P^{\prime}$ be two convex quadrilateral regions in the plane (regions contain their boundary). Let them intersect, with $O$ a point in the intersection. Suppose that for every line $\ell$ through $O$ the segment $\ell \cap P$ is strictly longer than the segment $\ell \cap P^{\prime}$. Is it possible that the ratio of the area of $P^{\prime}$ to the area of $P$ is greater than $1.9 ?$
Assistant: <think>
","To determine if the ratio of the area of $P^{\prime}$ to the area of $P$ can be greater than 1.9, let's analyze the given conditions. We know that for every line $\ell$ through $O$, the segment $\ell \cap P$ is strictly longer than the segment $\ell \cap P^{\prime}$. This implies that the quadrilateral $P$ contains more area than $P^{\prime}$ in any direction perpendicular to the line $\ell$ passing through $O$.

Let's consider the possibility that the ratio of the areas is greater than 1.9. If the ratio of the areas is 1.9, then the area of $P$ is 1.9 times the area of $P^{\prime}$. However, since the segments $\ell \cap P$ are strictly longer than $\ell \cap P^{\prime}$ for any line $\ell$ through $O$, the area of $P$ must be strictly greater than 1.9 times the area of $P^{\prime}$. This means the ratio of the areas must be greater than 1.9.

</think>
<answer> Yes, it is possible that the ratio of the area of $P^{\prime}$ to the area of $P$ is greater than 1.9. </answer>","The answer is in the affirmative: Given a positive $\epsilon<2$, the ratio in question may indeed be greater than $2-\epsilon$.



To show this, consider a square $A B C D$ centred at $O$, and let $A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}$, and $C^{\prime}$ be the reflections of $O$ in $A, B$, and $C$, respectively. Notice that, if $\ell$ is a line through $O$, then the segments $\ell \cap A B C D$ and $\ell \cap A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ have equal lengths, unless $\ell$ is the line $A C$.



Next, consider the points $M$ and $N$ on the segments $B^{\prime} A^{\prime}$ and $B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$, respectively, such that $B^{\prime} M / B^{\prime} A^{\prime}=B^{\prime} N / B^{\prime} C^{\prime}=(1-\epsilon / 4)^{1 / 2}$. Finally, let $P^{\prime}$ be the image of the convex quadrangle $B^{\prime} M O N$ under the homothety of ratio $(1-\epsilon / 4)^{1 / 4}$ centred at $O$. Clearly, the quadrangles $P \equiv A B C D$ and $P^{\prime}$ satisfy the conditions in the statement, and the ratio of the area of $P^{\prime}$ to the area of $P$ is exactly $2-\epsilon / 2$.

Given an integer $k \geq 2$, set $a_{1}=1$ and, for every integer $n \geq 2$, let $a_{n}$ be the smallest $x>a_{n-1}$ such that:



$$

x=1+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\left\lfloor\sqrt[k]{\frac{x}{a_{i}}}\right\rfloor

$$



Prove that every prime occurs in the sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the sequence and the given formula. We start with $a_1 = 1$. For $a_2$, we need to find the smallest $x > 1$ such that:
\[
x = 1 + \left\lfloor \sqrt[2]{\frac{x}{1}} \right\rfloor = 1 + \left\lfloor \sqrt{x} \right\rfloor
\]
This means $x$ must be such that when divided by 1, the square root of the result is an integer. The smallest such $x$ is 4, since $\sqrt{4} = 2$ is an integer. So, $a_2 = 4$.

Next, for $a_3$, we need to find the smallest $x > 4$ such that:
\[
x = 1 + \left\lfloor \sqrt[3]{\frac{x}{4}} \right\rfloor
\]
This means $x$ must be such that when divided by 4, the cube root of the result is an integer. The smallest such $x$ is 16, since $\sqrt[3]{16/4} = \sqrt[3]{4} = 1. 62...$ when rounded, but ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

... ... ...","We prove that the $a_{n}$ are precisely the $k$ th-power-free positive integers, that is, those divisible by the $k$ th power of no prime. The conclusion then follows.



Let $B$ denote the set of all $k$ th-power-free positive integers. We first show that, given a positive integer $c$,



$$

\sum_{b \in B, b \leq c}\left\lfloor\sqrt[k]{\frac{c}{b}}\right\rfloor=c

$$



To this end, notice that every positive integer has a unique representation as a product of an element in $B$ and a $k$ th power. Consequently, the set of all positive integers less than or equal to $c$ splits into



$$

C_{b}=\left\{x: x \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}, x \leq c, \text { and } x / b \text { is a } k \text { th power }\right\}, \quad b \in B, b \leq c

$$



Clearly, $\left|C_{b}\right|=\lfloor\sqrt[k]{c / b}\rfloor$, whence the desired equality.



Finally, enumerate $B$ according to the natural order: $1=b_{1}<b_{2}<\cdots<b_{n}<\cdots$. We prove by induction on $n$ that $a_{n}=b_{n}$. Clearly, $a_{1}=b_{1}=1$, so let $n \geq 2$ and assume $a_{m}=b_{m}$ for all indices $m<n$. Since $b_{n}>b_{n-1}=a_{n-1}$ and



$$

b_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left\lfloor\sqrt[k]{\frac{b_{n}}{b_{i}}}\right\rfloor=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\left\lfloor\sqrt[k]{\frac{b_{n}}{b_{i}}}\right\rfloor+1=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\left\lfloor\sqrt[k]{\frac{b_{n}}{a_{i}}}\right\rfloor+1

$$



the definition of $a_{n}$ forces $a_{n} \leq b_{n}$. Were $a_{n}<b_{n}$, a contradiction would follow:



$$

a_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\left\lfloor\sqrt[k]{\frac{a_{n}}{b_{i}}}\right\rfloor=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\left\lfloor\sqrt[k]{\frac{a_{n}}{a_{i}}}\right\rfloor=a_{n}-1

$$



Consequently, $a_{n}=b_{n}$. This completes the proof.",0,False,4754

$2 n$ distinct tokens are placed at the vertices of a regular $2 n$-gon, with one token placed at each vertex. A move consists of choosing an edge of the $2 n$-gon and interchanging the two tokens at the endpoints of that edge. Suppose that after a finite number of moves, every pair of tokens have been interchanged exactly once. Prove that some edge has never been chosen.
Assistant: <think>
","To solve this problem, we need to consider the nature of the moves and the constraints given. We have a regular $2n$-gon with $2n$ tokens, and each move consists of interchanging the tokens at the endpoints of an edge. The goal is to show that after a finite number of moves, where each pair of tokens is interchanged exactly once, some edge has never been chosen.

First, let's consider the total number of possible moves. Since there are $2n$ edges in a regular $2n$-gon, there are $2n$ possible moves. If each pair of tokens is interchanged exactly once, we would need to make $2n$ moves. However, we need to account for the fact that some edges might be chosen more than once, or not at all, to achieve the goal.

Now, let's think about the implications of each move. Each move involves two tokens, and after a move, the two tokens are swapped. If we consider the sequence of moves, we can see that the tokens will be in a different order after each move. The key is to recognize that if we can achieve the goal with $2n$ moves, then each edge must be used at least once, because if an edge is never used, we cannot achieve the goal of interchanging all pairs of tokens exactly once.

However, if we consider the possibility that some edges are never used, we can still achieve the goal by using the remaining edges. This means that the sequence of moves can be constructed such that each edge is used exactly once, but in a different order. This is possible because the problem does not specify that the order of the moves is important, only that each pair of tokens is interchanged exactly once.

</think>
<answer>Some edge has never been chosen.</answer>","Step 1. Enumerate all the tokens in the initial arrangement in clockwise circular order; also enumerate the vertices of the $2 n$-gon accordingly. Consider any three tokens $i<j<k$. At each moment, their cyclic order may be either $i, j, k$ or $i, k, j$, counted clockwise. This order changes exactly when two of these three tokens have been switched. Hence the order has been reversed thrice, and in the final arrangement token $k$ stands on the arc passing clockwise from token $i$ to token $j$. Thus, at the end, token $i+1$ is a counter-clockwise neighbor of token $i$ for all $i=1,2, \ldots, 2 n-1$, so the tokens in the final arrangement are numbered successively in counter-clockwise circular order.



This means that the final arrangement of tokens can be obtained from the initial one by reflection in some line $\ell$.



Step 2. Notice that each token was involved into $2 n-1$ switchings, so its initial and final vertices have different parity. Hence $\ell$ passes through the midpoints of two opposite sides of a $2 n$-gon; we may assume that these are the sides $a$ and $b$ connecting $2 n$ with 1 and $n$ with $n+1$, respectively.



During the process, each token $x$ has crossed $\ell$ at least once; thus one of its switchings has been made at edge $a$ or at edge $b$. Assume that some two its switchings were performed at $a$ and at $b$; we may (and will) assume that the one at $a$ was earlier, and $x \leq n$. Then the total movement of token $x$ consisted at least of: (i) moving from vertex $x$ to $a$ and crossing $\ell$ along $a$; (ii) moving from $a$ to $b$ and crossing $\ell$ along $b$; (iii) coming to vertex $2 n+1-x$. This tales at least $x+n+(n-x)=2 n$ switchings, which is impossible.



Thus, each token had a switching at exactly one of the edges $a$ and $b$.



Step 3. Finally, let us show that either each token has been switched at $a$, or each token has been switched at $b$ (then the other edge has never been used, as desired). To the contrary, assume that there were switchings at both $a$ and at $b$. Consider the first such switchings, and let $x$ and $y$ be the tokens which were moved clockwise during these switchings and crossed $\ell$ at $a$ and $b$, respectively. By Step 2, $x \neq y$. Then tokens $x$ and $y$ initially were on opposite sides of $\ell$.



Now consider the switching of tokens $x$ and $y$; there was exactly one such switching, and we assume that it has been made on the same side of $\ell$ as vertex $y$. Then this switching has been made after token $x$ had traced $a$. From this point on, token $x$ is on the clockwise arc from token $y$ to $b$, and it has no way to leave out from this arc.

Let $T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}, T_{4}$ be pairwise distinct collinear points such that $T_{2}$ lies between $T_{1}$ and $T_{3}$, and $T_{3}$ lies between $T_{2}$ and $T_{4}$. Let $\omega_{1}$ be a circle through $T_{1}$ and $T_{4}$; let $\omega_{2}$ be the circle through $T_{2}$ and internally tangent to $\omega_{1}$ at $T_{1}$; let $\omega_{3}$ be the circle through $T_{3}$ and externally tangent to $\omega_{2}$ at $T_{2}$; and let $\omega_{4}$ be the circle through $T_{4}$ and externally tangent to $\omega_{3}$ at $T_{3}$. A line crosses $\omega_{1}$ at $P$ and $W, \omega_{2}$ at $Q$ and $R, \omega_{3}$ at $S$ and $T$, and $\omega_{4}$ at $U$ and $V$, the order of these points along the line being $P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W$. Prove that $P Q+T U=R S+V W$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric properties of the circles and the line. The line intersects each circle at the points mentioned, and we need to prove that the sum of the lengths of the segments $PQ + TU$ equals the sum of the lengths of the segments $RS + VW$.

Since the circles are tangent to each other, the distances between the points of tangency are equal to the radii of the circles. Let's denote the radii of the circles as follows:
- $r_1$ is the radius of $\omega_1$.
- $r_2$ is the radius of $\omega_2$.
- $r_3$ is the radius of $\omega_3$.
- $r_4$ is the radius of $\omega_4$.

The line intersects $\omega_1$ at $P$ and $W$, $\omega_2$ at $Q$ and $R$, $\omega_3$ at $S$ and $T$, and $\omega_4$ at $U$ and $V$. The key observation is that the line is symmetric with respect to the points of tangency. This symmetry implies that the distances from the points of tangency to the points of intersection on the line are equal in pairs. Specifically, $PQ = RT$ and $ST = UV$.

Now, let's consider the segments $PQ + TU$ and $RS + VW$. Since $PQ = RT$ and $ST = UV$, we can rewrite the segments as:
- $PQ + TU = RT + UV$
- $RS + VW = RT + UV$

Thus, we have $PQ + TU = RS + VW$. </think>
<answer> $PQ + TU = RS + VW$ </answer>","Let $O_{i}$ be the centre of $\omega_{i}, i=1,2,3,4$. Notice that the isosceles triangles $O_{i} T_{i} T_{i-1}$ are similar (indices are reduced modulo 4), to infer that $\omega_{4}$ is internally tangent to $\omega_{1}$ at $T_{4}$, and $\mathrm{O}_{1} \mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ is a (possibly degenerate) parallelogram.



Let $F_{i}$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $O_{i}$ to $P W$. The $F_{i}$ clearly bisect the segments $P W, Q R, S T$ and $U V$, respectively.



The proof can now be concluded in two similar ways.



<img_3714>



First Approach. Since $\mathrm{O}_{1} \mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ is a parallelogram, $\overrightarrow{F_{1} F_{2}}+\overrightarrow{F_{3} F_{4}}=\mathbf{0}$ and $\overrightarrow{F_{2} F_{3}}+\overrightarrow{F_{4} F_{1}}=\mathbf{0}$; this still holds in the degenerate case, for if the $O_{i}$ are collinear, then they all lie on the line $T_{1} T_{4}$, and each $O_{i}$ is the midpoint of the segment $T_{i} T_{i+1}$. Consequently,



$$

\begin{aligned}

\overrightarrow{P Q}-\overrightarrow{R S}+\overrightarrow{T U}-\overrightarrow{V W}= & \left(\overrightarrow{P F_{1}}+\overrightarrow{F_{1} F_{2}}+\overrightarrow{F_{2} Q}\right)-\left(\overrightarrow{R F_{2}}+\overrightarrow{F_{2} F_{3}}+\overrightarrow{F_{3} S}\right) \\

& +\left(\overrightarrow{T F_{3}}+\overrightarrow{F_{3} F_{4}}+\overrightarrow{F_{4} U}\right)-\left(\overrightarrow{V F_{4}}+\overrightarrow{F_{4} F_{1}}+\overrightarrow{F_{1} W}\right) \\

= & \left(\overrightarrow{P F_{1}}-\overrightarrow{F_{1} W}\right)-\left(\overrightarrow{R F_{2}}-\overrightarrow{F_{2} Q}\right)+\left(\overrightarrow{T F_{3}}-\overrightarrow{F_{3} S}\right)-\left(\overrightarrow{V F_{4}}-\overrightarrow{F_{4} U}\right) \\

& +\left(\overrightarrow{F_{1} F_{2}}+\overrightarrow{F_{3} F_{4}}\right)-\left(\overrightarrow{F_{2} F_{3}}+\overrightarrow{F_{4} F_{1}}\right)=\mathbf{0} .

\end{aligned}

$$



Alternatively, but equivalently, $\overrightarrow{P Q}+\overrightarrow{T U}=\overrightarrow{R S}+\overrightarrow{V W}$, as required.



Second Approach. This is merely another way of reading the previous argument. Fix an orientation of the line $P W$, say, from $P$ towards $W$, and use a lower case letter to denote the coordinate of a point labelled by the corresponding upper case letter.



Since the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect one another, $f_{1}+f_{3}=f_{2}+f_{4}$, the common value being twice the coordinate of the projection to $P W$ of the point where $O_{1} O_{3}$ and $O_{2} O_{4}$ cross; the relation clearly holds in the degenerate case as well.







Plug $f_{1}=\frac{1}{2}(p+w), f_{2}=\frac{1}{2}(q+r), f_{3}=\frac{1}{2}(s+t)$ and $f_{4}=\frac{1}{2}(u+v)$ into the above equality to get $p+w+s+t=q+r+u+v$. Alternatively, but equivalently, $(q-p)+(u-t)=(s-r)+(w-v)$, that is, $P Q+T U=R Q+V W$, as required.",0,False,370

A number of 17 workers stand in a row. Every contiguous group of at least 2 workers is a brigade. The chief wants to assign each brigade a leader (which is a member of the brigade) so that each worker's number of assignments is divisible by 4 . Prove that the number of such ways to assign the leaders is divisible by 17 .
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the problem. We have 17 workers, and we need to assign each brigade a leader such that the number of assignments for each worker is divisible by 4. We need to prove that the number of such ways to assign the leaders is divisible by 17.

To approach this, let's first consider the possible number of assignments for each worker. Since each worker can be assigned to a leader from their own brigade, and the number of assignments for each worker must be divisible by 4, the possible values for the number of assignments are 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16. 

Now, let's think about the constraints. If we have 17 workers, and each worker can be assigned to a leader from their own brigade, then the only way to satisfy the condition that the number of assignments for each worker is divisible by 4 is if each worker is assigned to a leader from their own brigade. This is because if any worker is assigned to a leader from another brigade, the number of assignments for that worker would not be divisible by 4.

Given that each worker must be assigned to a leader from their own brigade, and there are 17 workers, the only way to assign the leaders is to have each worker be their own leader. This means that the number of ways to assign the leaders is 1, which is indeed divisible by 17.

</think>
<answer>1</answer>","Assume that every single worker also forms a brigade (with a unique possible leader). In this modified setting, we are interested in the number $N$ of ways to assign leadership so that each worker's number of assignments is congruent to 1 modulo 4.



Consider the variables $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{17}$ corresponding to the workers. Assign each brigade (from the $i$-th through the $j$-th worker) the polynomial $f_{i j}=x_{i}+x_{i+1}+\cdots+x_{j}$, and form the product $f=\prod_{1 \leq i \leq j \leq 17} f_{i j}$. The number $N$ is the sum $\Sigma(f)$ of the coefficients of all monomials $x_{1}^{\alpha_{1}} x_{2}^{\alpha_{2}} \ldots x_{17}^{\alpha_{17}}$ in the expansion of $f$, where the $\alpha_{i}$ are all congruent to 1 modulo 4 . For any polynomial $P$, let $\Sigma(P)$ denote the corresponding sum. From now on, all polynomials are considered with coefficients in the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{17}$.



Recall that for any positive integer $n$, and any integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, there exist indices $i \leq j$ such that $a_{i}+a_{i+1}+\cdots+a_{j}$ is divisible by $n$. Consequently, $f\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{17}\right)=0$ for all $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{17}$ in $\mathbb{F}_{17}$.



Now, if some monomial in the expansion of $f$ is divisible by $x_{i}^{17}$, replace that $x_{i}^{17}$ by $x_{i}$; this does not alter the above overall vanishing property (by Fermat's Little Theorem), and preserves $\Sigma(f)$. After several such changes, $f$ transforms into a polynomial $g$ whose degree in each variable does not exceed 16 , and $g\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{17}\right)=0$ for all $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{17}$ in $\mathbb{F}_{17}$. For such a polynomial, an easy induction on the number of variables shows that it is identically zero. Consequently, $\Sigma(g)=0$, so $\Sigma(f)=0$ as well, as desired.",0,False,307

Let $A B C$ be a triangle, let $D$ be the touchpoint of the side $B C$ and the incircle of the triangle $A B C$, and let $J_{b}$ and $J_{c}$ be the incentres of the triangles $A B D$ and $A C D$, respectively. Prove that the circumcentre of the triangle $A J_{b} J_{c}$ lies on the bisectrix of the angle $B A C$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the points and the triangle. The point $D$ is the point where the incircle of $\triangle ABC$ touches the side $BC$. The incenters $J_b$ and $J_c$ are the incenters of $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle ACD$, respectively. We need to prove that the circumcenter of $\triangle AJ_b J_c$ lies on the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$.

Since $J_b$ and $J_c$ are incenters, they lie on the angle bisectors of $\angle ABD$ and $\angle ACD$, respectively. The angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ is the line that divides $\angle BAC$ into two equal angles. 

Now, let's consider the circumcenter of $\triangle AJ_b J_c$. The circumcenter is the point equidistant from all three vertices of the triangle. If we can show that the circumcenter of $\triangle AJ_b J_c$ lies on the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$, then we have proven the statement.

To do this, we can use the fact that the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining the points where the angle bisectors of $\angle ABD$ and $\angle ACD$ intersect the line $BC$. This intersection point is $D$, and the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ is the line that passes through $A$ and is perpendicular to $BC$.

Since $J_b$ and $J_c$ are on the angle bisectors of $\angle ABD$ and $\angle ACD$, and the circumcenter of $\triangle AJ_b J_c$ is equidistant from $A$, $J_b$, and $J_c$, it must lie on the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$. This is because the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ is the only line that can be equidistant from $A$, $J_b$, and $J_c$ when considering the geometry of the triangle and the incenters. </think>
<answer> The circumcenter of the triangle $AJ_b J_c$ lies on the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$.</answer>","Let the incircle of the triangle $A B C$ meet $C A$ and $A B$ at points $E$ and $F$, respectively. Let the incircles of the triangles $A B D$ and $A C D$ meet $A D$ at points $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Then $2 D X=D A+D B-A B=D A+D B-B F-A F=D A-A F$; similarly, $2 D Y=D A-A E=2 D X$. Hence the points $X$ and $Y$ coincide, so $J_{b} J_{c} \perp A D$.



Now let $O$ be the circumcentre of the triangle $A J_{b} J_{c}$. Then $\angle J_{b} A O=\pi / 2-\angle A O J_{b} / 2=$ $\pi / 2-\angle A J_{c} J_{b}=\angle X A J_{c}=\frac{1}{2} \angle D A C$. Therefore, $\angle B A O=\angle B A J_{b}+\angle J_{b} A O=\frac{1}{2} \angle B A D+$ $\frac{1}{2} \angle D A C=\frac{1}{2} \angle B A C$, and the conclusion follows.

Prove that every positive integer $n$ can be written uniquely in the form



$$

n=\sum_{j=1}^{2 k+1}(-1)^{j-1} 2^{m_{j}}

where $k \geq 0$ and $0 \leq m_{1}<m_{2}<\cdots<m_{2 k+1}$ are integers.

","To prove that every positive integer \( n \) can be written uniquely in the form

\[
n = \sum_{j=1}^{2 k+1}(-1)^{j-1} 2^{m_{j}}
\]

where \( k \geq 0 \) and \( 0 \leq m_{1} < m_{2} < \cdots < m_{2 k+1} \) are integers, we need to consider the properties of binary representation and the structure of the given sum. 

First, let's consider the binary representation of a number. Every positive integer can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2. This is the basis of binary representation. 

Now, let's think about the given sum. The sum is structured such that it alternates between adding and subtracting powers of 2. This structure is designed to help us achieve the binary representation of the number. 

To see how this works, let's consider an example. Suppose we want to represent the number 13. The binary representation of 13 is 1101. We can break this down as follows:

- 13 = 2^3 + 2^2 - 2^1 + 2^0
- This corresponds to the sum: 13 = (-1)^1 2^3 + (-1)^2 2^2 + (-1)^3 2^1 + (-1)^4 2^0

This shows that 13 can indeed be written in the form given, with \( k = 2 \) and the sequence of exponents being 3, 2, 1, 0. 

</think>
<answer> n = \sum_{j=1}^{2 k+1}(-1)^{j-1} 2^{m_{j}} </answer>","We show by induction on the integer $M \geq 0$ that every integer $n$ in the range $-2^{M}+1$ through $2^{M}$ can uniquely be written in the form $n=\sum_{j=1}^{\ell}(-1)^{j-1} 2^{m_{j}}$ for some integers $\ell \geq 0$ and $0 \leq m_{1}<m_{2}<\cdots<m_{\ell} \leq M$ (empty sums are 0 ); moreover, in this unique representation $\ell$ is odd if $n>0$, and even if $n \leq 0$. The integer $w(n)=\lfloor\ell / 2\rfloor$ is called the weight of $n$.



Existence once proved, uniqueness follows from the fact that there are as many such representations as integers in the range $-2^{M}+1$ through $2^{M}$, namely, $2^{M+1}$.



To prove existence, notice that the base case $M=0$ is clear, so let $M \geq 1$ and let $n$ be an integer in the range $-2^{M}+1$ through $2^{M}$.



If $-2^{M}+1 \leq n \leq-2^{M-1}$, then $1 \leq n+2^{M} \leq 2^{M-1}$, so $n+2^{M}=\sum_{j=1}^{2 k+1}(-1)^{j-1} 2^{m_{j}}$ for some integers $k \geq 0$ and $0 \leq m_{1}<\cdots<m_{2 k+1} \leq M-1$ by the induction hypothesis, and $n=\sum_{j=1}^{2 k+2}(-1)^{j-1} 2^{m_{j}}$, where $m_{2 k+2}=M$.



The case $-2^{M-1}+1 \leq n \leq 2^{M-1}$ is covered by the induction hypothesis.



Finally, if $2^{M-1}+1 \leq n \leq 2^{M}$, then $-2^{M-1}+1 \leq n-2^{M} \leq 0$, so $n-2^{M}=\sum_{j=1}^{2 k}(-1)^{j-1} 2^{m_{j}}$ for some integers $k \geq 0$ and $0 \leq m_{1}<\cdots<m_{2 k} \leq M-1$ by the induction hypothesis, and $n=\sum_{j=1}^{2 k+1}(-1)^{j-1} 2^{m_{j}}$, where $m_{2 k+1}=M$.",0,False,394

Given a triangle $A B C$, let $H$ and $O$ be its orthocentre and circumcentre, respectively. Let $K$ be the midpoint of the line segment $A H$. Let further $\ell$ be a line through $O$, and let $P$ and $Q$ be the orthogonal projections of $B$ and $C$ onto $\ell$, respectively. Prove that $K P+K Q \geq B C$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric properties of the triangle and the given points. The orthocenter \(H\) is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect, and the circumcenter \(O\) is the center of the circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle. The line segment \(AH\) is an altitude from vertex \(A\) to the opposite side \(BC\). The midpoint \(K\) of \(AH\) is the point that divides \(AH\) into two equal segments.

The line \(\ell\) through \(O\) is perpendicular to the line segment \(PQ\), where \(P\) and \(Q\) are the orthogonal projections of \(B\) and \(C\) onto \(\ell\), respectively. This means that \(PQ\) is parallel to the line through \(B\) and \(C\) that is perpendicular to \(\ell\).

Now, let's consider the distances involved. Since \(K\) is the midpoint of \(AH\), the distance from \(K\) to \(H\) is half the length of \(AH\). The line \(\ell\) is perpendicular to \(PQ\), and since \(PQ\) is parallel to the line through \(B\) and \(C\) that is perpendicular to \(\ell\), the distance from \(K\) to this line is also half the length of \(BC\).

By the properties of the triangle and the distances, we can use the fact that the sum of the distances from the midpoint of an altitude to the projections of the other two vertices on a line perpendicular to that altitude is at least the length of the side of the triangle. This is a known geometric inequality for such configurations.

Let $P(x), Q(x), R(x)$ and $S(x)$ be non-constant polynomials with real coefficients such that $P(Q(x))=R(S(x))$. Suppose that the degree of $P(x)$ is divisible by the degree of $R(x)$.



Prove that there is a polynomial $T(x)$ with real coefficients such that $P(x)=R(T(x))$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the degrees of the polynomials involved. Given that the degree of $P(x)$ is divisible by the degree of $R(x)$, we can write $P(x) = a_n x^{dR} P_1(x)$ and $R(x) = b_m x^{dP} R_1(x)$, where $dR$ and $dP$ are the degrees of $R(x)$ and $P(x)$ respectively, and $a_n$ and $b_m$ are non-zero constants. The equation $P(Q(x)) = R(S(x))$ then becomes:
\[ a_n x^{dR} P_1(Q(x)) = b_m x^{dP} R_1(S(x)). \]
Since the degrees of the polynomials on both sides must match, we have $dR = dP$. This means we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ a_n P_1(Q(x)) = b_m R_1(S(x)). \]

We will show that $S(x)=T(Q(x))$ for some polynomial $T$. Then $P(Q(x))=R(S(x))=R(T(Q(x)))$, so the polynomial $P(t)-R(T(t))$ vanishes upon substitution $t=S(x)$; it therefore vanishes identically, as desired.



Choose the polynomials $T(x)$ and $M(x)$ such that

Let $r, g, b$ be non-negative integers. Let $\Gamma$ be a connected graph on $r+g+b+1$ vertices. The edges of $\Gamma$ are each coloured red, green or blue. It turns out that $\Gamma$ has



- a spanning tree in which exactly $r$ of the edges are red,

- a spanning tree in which exactly $g$ of the edges are green and

- a spanning tree in which exactly $b$ of the edges are blue.



Prove that $\Gamma$ has a spanning tree in which exactly $r$ of the edges are red, exactly $g$ of the edges are green and exactly $b$ of the edges are blue.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions. We have a graph $\Gamma$ with $r+g+b+1$ vertices and edges colored red, green, and blue. We know that $\Gamma$ has a spanning tree with exactly $r$ red edges, a spanning tree with exactly $g$ green edges, and a spanning tree with exactly $b$ blue edges. We need to prove that $\Gamma$ has a spanning tree with exactly $r$ red edges, $g$ green edges, and $b$ blue edges.

To approach this, let's consider the structure of the spanning trees. A spanning tree of a graph is a subgraph that is a tree and includes all the vertices of the original graph. The key observation here is that the spanning trees we have are not necessarily the same tree, but they are all trees that use the specified number of edges of each color. 

Now, let's think about the possibility of combining these trees to form a single tree that uses exactly $r$ red edges, $g$ green edges, and $b$ blue edges. One way to do this is to consider the possibility of using the edges from each tree in a way that they can be combined to form a single tree. 

Since the trees are spanning, they each include all the vertices of the original graph. If we can find a way to combine the edges from these trees to form a single tree that uses exactly $r$ red edges, $g$ green edges, and $b$ blue edges, then we have our desired spanning tree.

Let now $n>1$. Let $V$ denote the vertex set of $\Gamma$, and let $T_{r}, T_{g}$, and $T_{b}$ be the trees with exactly $r$ red edges, $g$ green edges, and $b$ blue edges, respectively. Consider two cases.



Case 1: There exists a partition $V=A \sqcup B$ of the vertex set into two non-empty parts such that the edges joining the parts all bear the same colour, say, blue.



Since $\Gamma$ is connected, it has a (necessarily blue) edge connecting $A$ and $B$. Let $e$ be one such.



Assume that $T$, one of the three trees, does not contain $e$. Then the graph $T \cup\{e\}$ has a cycle $C$ through $e$. The cycle $C$ should contain another edge $e^{\prime}$ connecting $A$ and $B$; the edge $e^{\prime}$ is also blue. Replace $e^{\prime}$ by $e$ in $T$ to get another tree $T^{\prime}$ with the same number of edges of each colour as in $T$, but containing $e$.



Performing such an operation to all three trees, we arrive at the situation where the three trees $T_{r}^{\prime}$, $T_{g}^{\prime}$, and $T_{b}^{\prime}$ all contain $e$. Now shrink $e$ by identifying its endpoints to obtain a graph $\Gamma^{*}$, and set $r^{*}=r, g^{*}=g$, and $b^{*}=b-1$. The new graph satisfies the conditions in the statement for those new values - indeed, under the shrinking, each of the trees $T_{r}^{\prime}, T_{g}^{\prime}$, and $T_{b}^{\prime}$ loses a blue edge. So $\Gamma^{*}$ has a spanning tree with exactly $r$ red, exactly $g$ green, and exactly $b-1$ blue edges. Finally, pass back to $\Gamma$ by restoring $e$, to obtain the a desired spanning tree in $\Gamma$.



Case 2: There is no such a partition.



Consider all possible collections $(R, G, B)$, where $R, G$ and $B$ are acyclic sets consisting of $r$ red edges, $g$ green edges, and $b$ blue edges, respectively. By the problem assumptions, there is at least one such collection. Amongst all such collections, consider one such that the graph on $V$ with edge set $R \cup G \cup B$ has the smallest number $k$ of components. If $k=1$, then the collection provides the edges of a desired tree (the number of edges is one less than the number of vertices).



Assume now that $k \geq 2$; then in the resulting graph some component $K$ contains a cycle $C$. Since $R, G$, and $B$ are acyclic, $C$ contains edges of at least two colours, say, red and green. By assumption, the edges joining $V(K)$ to $V \backslash V(K)$ bear at least two colours; so one of these edges is either red or green. Without loss of generality, consider a red such edge $e$.



Let $e^{\prime}$ be a red edge in $C$ and set $R^{\prime}=R \backslash\left\{e^{\prime}\right\} \cup$ $\{e\}$. Then $\left(R^{\prime}, G, B\right)$ is a valid collection providing a smaller number of components. This contradicts minimality of the choice above and concludes the proof.",0,False,366

Fix an integer $n \geqslant 3$. Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane, no three of which are collinear. Given different points $A, B, C$ in $\mathcal{S}$, the triangle $A B C$ is nice for $A B$ if Area $(A B C) \leqslant \operatorname{Area}(A B X)$ for all $X$ in $\mathcal{S}$ different from $A$ and $B$. (Note that for a segment $A B$ there could be several nice triangles.) A triangle is beautiful if its vertices are all in $\mathcal{S}$ and it is nice for at least two of its sides.



Prove that there are at least $\frac{1}{2}(n-1)$ beautiful triangles.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the problem. We need to find at least $\frac{1}{2}(n-1)$ beautiful triangles from a set of $n$ points. A triangle is beautiful if it is nice for at least two of its sides. 

To approach this, let's start by considering the number of ways to choose two points from the set $\mathcal{S}$. There are $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ ways to choose two points from $n$ points. 

Now, for each pair of points, we need to check if there is a third point that forms a nice triangle with them. A triangle is nice for a side if the area of the triangle is less than or equal to the area of the triangle formed by that side and another point. 

If we can show that for each pair of points, there is at least one third point that forms a nice triangle, then we have at least $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ beautiful triangles. However, we need to show that there are at least $\frac{1}{2}(n-1)$ beautiful triangles, which is a fraction of the total. 

To achieve this, we can use the fact that if we consider the points in a specific order, we can often find a pattern that helps us to identify the beautiful triangles. For example, if we consider the points in a cyclic order, we can often find that each point is part of a beautiful triangle with the next two points in the sequence. </think>
<answer> \frac{1}{2}(n-1) </answer>","For convenience, a triangle whose vertices all lie in $\mathcal{S}$ will be referred to as a triangle in $\mathcal{S}$. The argument hinges on the following observation:



Given any partition of $\mathcal{S}$, amongst all triangles in $\mathcal{S}$ with at least one vertex in each part, those of minimal area are all adequate.



Indeed, amongst the triangles under consideration, one of minimal area is suitable for both sides with endpoints in different parts.



We now present two approaches for the lower bound.



1st Approach. By the above observation, the 3uniform hypergraph of adequate triangles is connected. It is a well-known fact that such a hypergraph has at least $\frac{1}{2}(n-1)$ hyperedges, whence the required lower bound



2nd Approach. For a partition $\mathcal{S}=\mathcal{A} \sqcup \mathcal{B}$, an area minimising triangle as above will be called $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B})$ minimal. Thus, $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B})$-minimal triangles are all adequate.



Consider now a partition of $\mathcal{S}=\mathcal{A} \sqcup \mathcal{B}$, where $|\mathcal{A}|=1$. Choose an $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B})$-minimal triangle and add to $\mathcal{A}$ its vertices from $\mathcal{B}$ to obtain a new partition also written $\mathcal{S}=\mathcal{A} \sqcup \mathcal{B}$. Continuing, choose an $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B})$-minimal triangle and add to $\mathcal{A}$ its vertices/vertex from $\mathcal{B}$ and so on and so forth all the way down for at least another $\frac{1}{2}(n-5)$ steps - this works at least as many times, since at each step, $\mathcal{B}$ loses at most two points. Clearly, each step provides a new adequate triangle, so the overall number of adequate triangles is at least $\frac{1}{2}(n-1)$, as required.",0,False,340

Let $x$ and $y$ be positive real numbers such that $x+y^{2016} \geq 1$. Prove that $x^{2016}+y>$ $1-1 / 100$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given inequality: $x + y^{2016} \geq 1$. We need to show that $x^{2016} + y > 1 - \frac{1}{100}$. 

Let's start by examining the expression $x^{2016} + y$. We know that $x^{2016} \geq x$ because $x$ is a positive real number and any positive number raised to a high power is still positive. 

Now, let's consider the inequality $x^{2016} + y > 1 - \frac{1}{100}$. We can rearrange this to $x^{2016} + y - 1 > -\frac{1}{100}$. 

Since $x + y^{2016} \geq 1$, we can subtract 1 from both sides to get $x + y^{2016} - 1 \geq 0$. This means that $x^{2016} + y - 1$ is at least as large as $x + y^{2016} - 1$, and since $x + y^{2016} - 1 \geq 0$, it follows that $x^{2016} + y - 1 > -\frac{1}{100}$. </think>
<answer> x^{2016} + y > 1 - \frac{1}{100} </answer>","If $x \geq 1-1 /(100 \cdot 2016)$, then



$$

x^{2016} \geq\left(1-\frac{1}{100 \cdot 2016}\right)^{2016}>1-2016 \cdot \frac{1}{100 \cdot 2016}=1-\frac{1}{100}

$$



by Bernoulli's inequality, whence the conclusion.



If $x<1-1 /(100 \cdot 2016)$, then $y \geq(1-x)^{1 / 2016}>(100 \cdot 2016)^{-1 / 2016}$, and it is sufficient to show that the latter is greater than $1-1 / 100=99 / 100$; alternatively, but equivalently, that



$$

\left(1+\frac{1}{99}\right)^{2016}>100 \cdot 2016

$$



To establish the latter, refer again to Bernoulli's inequality to write



$$

\left(1+\frac{1}{99}\right)^{2016}>\left(1+\frac{1}{99}\right)^{99 \cdot 20}>\left(1+99 \cdot \frac{1}{99}\right)^{20}=2^{20}>100 \cdot 2016 .

","First, let's consider the geometric configuration. The hexagon $A_{1} B_{1} A_{2} B_{2} A_{3} B_{3}$ is inscribed in a circle $\Omega$ with radius $R$. The diagonals $A_{1} B_{2}$, $A_{2} B_{3}$, and $A_{3} B_{1}$ intersect at a point $X$. The circles $\omega_{1}$, $\omega_{2}$, and $\omega_{3}$ are tangent to the segments $XA_{i}$ and $XB_{i}$, and to the arc $A_{i} B_{i}$ of $\Omega$ not containing other vertices of the hexagon. We need to prove that $R \geq r_{1} + r_{2} + r_{3}$.

To approach this, we can use the fact that the radius of a circle tangent to a chord and a segment from the center of the circle to a point on the circle is related to the radius of the circle and the distance from the center to the point of tangency. Specifically, if a circle is tangent to a chord and a segment from the center to a point on the circle, the radius of the circle can be expressed in terms of the radius of the larger circle and the distance from the center to the point of tangency.

Let's denote the distance from the center of $\Omega$ to $X$ as $d$. The radius $r_{i}$ of $\omega_{i}$ can be expressed as:
\[ r_{i} = R - \frac{d}{2} \]
This is because the distance from the center of $\Omega$ to the point of tangency on $\omega_{i}$ is $R - r_{i}$, and this distance is also the distance from the center of $\Omega$ to $X$ minus half the length of the segment from $X$ to the point of tangency on $\omega_{i}$.

Now, we need to consider the sum of the radii $r_{1} + r_{2} + r_{3}$. Using the expression for $r_{i}$, we get:
\[ r_{1} + r_{2} + r_{3} = \left( R - \frac{d}{2} \right) + \left( R - \frac{d}{2} \right) + \left( R - \frac{d}{2} \right) = 3R - \frac{3d}{2} \]
Since $d$ is a positive distance, we have:
\[ 3R - \frac{3d}{2} < 3R \]
This means that $R \geq r_{1} + r_{2} + r_{3}$, as required. </think>

The lines $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}, \ell_{2}$ and $\ell_{3}, \ell_{3}$ and $\ell_{1}$ meet at $C_{3}, C_{1}, C_{2}$, respectively (see Fig. 1).

Each of the triangles $\Delta_{1}=\triangle X S_{1} T_{1}, \Delta_{2}=\triangle T_{2} X S_{2}$, and $\Delta_{3}=\triangle S_{3} T_{3} X$ is similar to $\Delta=\triangle C_{1} C_{2} C_{3}$, since their corresponding sides are parallel.

","First, let's consider the given conditions and the properties of the circles $\omega_i$. The circles $\omega_i$ are tangent to the segments $X A_i$ and $X B_i$, and to the arc $A_i B_i$ of the circle $\Omega$ not containing the other vertices. The radius of each circle $\omega_i$ is denoted by $r_i$. The key condition is that $R = r_1 + r_2 + r_3$.

We need to show that the six points where the circles $\omega_i$ touch the diagonals $A_1 B_2$, $A_2 B_3$, and $A_3 B_1$ are concyclic. Let's denote these points of tangency as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5, P_6$.

Since the circles $\omega_i$ are tangent to the diagonals and to the arc $A_i B_i$, the points of tangency $P_i$ lie on the lines $A_i B_i$. The key observation is that the points $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are the points where the circles $\omega_i$ touch the diagonals, and they are the points of intersection of the circles with the diagonals. 

The fact that $R = r_1 + r_2 + r_3$ suggests a relationship between the radii and the radius of the circle $\Omega$. This relationship, combined with the tangency conditions, implies that the points $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are such that they form a cyclic quadrilateral when combined with the points of tangency on the other diagonals. 

To see this more clearly, consider the symmetry and the fact that the circles are tangent to the diagonals and the arc. The points of tangency on the diagonals and the points of tangency on the arcs form a configuration that is consistent with the concyclic nature of the points. </think>

A set of $n$ points in Euclidean 3-dimensional space, no four of which are coplanar, is partitioned into two subsets $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$. An $\mathcal{A B}$-tree is a configuration of $n-1$ segments, each of which has an endpoint in $\mathcal{A}$ and the other in $\mathcal{B}$, and such that no segments form a closed polyline. An $\mathcal{A B}$-tree is transformed into another as follows: choose three distinct segments $A_{1} B_{1}, B_{1} A_{2}$ and $A_{2} B_{2}$ in the $\mathcal{A B}$-tree such that $A_{1}$ is in $\mathcal{A}$ and $A_{1} B_{1}+A_{2} B_{2}>A_{1} B_{2}+A_{2} B_{1}$, and remove the segment $A_{1} B_{1}$ to replace it by the segment $A_{1} B_{2}$. Given any $\mathcal{A B}$-tree, prove that every sequence of successive transformations comes to an end (no further transformation is possible) after finitely many steps.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that every sequence of successive transformations in an \(\mathcal{A B}\)-tree comes to an end after finitely many steps, we need to consider the nature of the transformations and the constraints given. 

First, let's understand the transformation process. We start with an \(\mathcal{A B}\)-tree, which is a configuration of \(n-1\) segments, each with one endpoint in \(\mathcal{A}\) and the other in \(\mathcal{B}\). The transformation involves choosing three segments \(A_{1} B_{1}, B_{1} A_{2}\), and \(A_{2} B_{2}\) such that \(A_{1}\) is in \(\mathcal{A}\), and applying the rule to replace \(A_{1} B_{1}\) with \(A_{1} B_{2}\). This transformation reduces the number of segments by 1 and changes the configuration of the tree.

The key observation is that each transformation strictly reduces the number of segments in the tree. Since the tree starts with \(n-1\) segments and each transformation reduces the number of segments by 1, the tree will eventually be reduced to a single segment. This single segment will be a segment connecting a point in \(\mathcal{A}\) to a point in \(\mathcal{B}\), which is the final configuration of the tree after all possible transformations have been applied.

</think>
<answer>After finitely many steps, the tree will be reduced to a single segment, which is the final configuration of the tree. </answer>","The configurations of segments under consideration are all bipartite geometric trees on the points $n$ whose vertex-parts are $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, and transforming one into another preserves the degree of any vertex in $\mathcal{A}$, but not necessarily that of a vertex in $\mathcal{B}$.



The idea is to devise a strict semi-invariant of the process, i.e., assign each $\mathcal{A B}$-tree a real number strictly decreasing under a transformation. Since the number of trees on the $n$ points is finite, the conclusion follows.



To describe the assignment, consider an $\mathcal{A B}$-tree $\mathcal{T}=(\mathcal{A} \sqcup \mathcal{B}, \mathcal{E})$. Removal of an edge $e$ of $\mathcal{T}$ splits the graph into exactly two components. Let $p_{\mathcal{T}}(e)$ be the number of vertices in $\mathcal{A}$ lying in the component of $\mathcal{T}-e$ containing the $\mathcal{A}$-endpoint of $e$; since $\mathcal{T}$ is a tree, $p_{\mathcal{T}}(e)$ counts the number of paths in $\mathcal{T}-e$ from the $\mathcal{A}$-endpoint of $e$ to vertices in $\mathcal{A}$ (including the one-vertex path). Define $f(\mathcal{T})=\sum_{e \in \mathcal{E}} p_{\mathcal{T}}(e)|e|$, where $|e|$ is the Euclidean length of $e$.



We claim that $f$ strictly decreases under a transformation. To prove this, let $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ be obtained from $\mathcal{T}$ by a transformation involving the polyline $A_{1} B_{1} A_{2} B_{2}$; that is, $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are in $\mathcal{A}, B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ are in $\mathcal{B}, A_{1} B_{1}+A_{2} B_{2}>A_{1} B_{2}+A_{2} B_{1}$, and $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}=\mathcal{T}-A_{1} B_{1}+A_{1} B_{2}$. It is readily checked that $p_{\mathcal{T}^{\prime}}(e)=p_{\mathcal{T}}(e)$ for every edge $e$ of $\mathcal{T}$ different from $A_{1} B_{1}, A_{2} B_{1}$ and $A_{2} B_{2}, p_{\mathcal{T}^{\prime}}\left(A_{1} B_{2}\right)=$ $p_{\mathcal{T}}\left(A_{1} B_{1}\right), p_{\mathcal{T}^{\prime}}\left(A_{2} B_{1}\right)=p_{\mathcal{T}}\left(A_{2} B_{1}\right)+p_{\mathcal{T}}\left(A_{1} B_{1}\right)$, and $p_{\mathcal{T}^{\prime}}\left(A_{2} B b_{2}\right)=p_{\mathcal{T}}\left(A_{2} B_{2}\right)-p_{\mathcal{T}}\left(A_{1} B_{1}\right)$. Consequently,



$$

\begin{aligned}

f\left(\mathcal{T}^{\prime}\right)-f(\mathcal{T})= & p_{\mathcal{T}^{\prime}}\left(A_{1} B_{2}\right) \cdot A_{1} B_{2}+\left(p_{\mathcal{T}^{\prime}}\left(A_{2} B_{1}\right)-p_{\mathcal{T}}\left(A_{2} B_{1}\right)\right) \cdot A_{2} B_{1}+ \\

Given a positive integer $n=\prod_{i=1}^{s} p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$, we write $\Omega(n)$ for the total number $\sum_{i=1}^{s} \alpha_{i}$ of prime factors of $n$, counted with multiplicity. Let $\lambda(n)=(-1)^{\Omega(n)}$ (so, for example, $\left.\lambda(12)=\lambda\left(2^{2} \cdot 3^{1}\right)=(-1)^{2+1}=-1\right)$.
Prove that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $\lambda(n)=\lambda(n+1)=+1$
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that there are infinitely many positive integers \( n \) such that \( \lambda(n) = \lambda(n+1) = +1 \), we need to consider the properties of the function \( \lambda(n) \). The function \( \lambda(n) = (-1)^{\Omega(n)} \) changes sign when the number of prime factors of \( n \) changes. Specifically, \( \lambda(n) = +1 \) if and only if the number of prime factors of \( n \) is even. 

We need to find a sequence of integers \( n \) such that both \( n \) and \( n+1 \) have an even number of prime factors. 

One way to approach this is to consider the sequence of numbers that are one less than a power of 2. For example, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, ... are one less than 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... respectively. 

Let's check the number of prime factors for these numbers:
- \( 1 = 2^0 \) has 0 prime factors, which is even.
- \( 3 = 3^1 \) has 1 prime factor, which is odd.
- \( 7 = 7^1 \) has 1 prime factor, which is odd.
- \( 15 = 3^1 \cdot 5^1 \) has 2 prime factors, which is even.
- \( 31 = 31^1 \) has 1 prime factor, which is odd.
- ... and so on.

From this, we see that the numbers 1, 15, ... have an even number of prime factors, and the next number, 3, ... has an odd number of prime factors. This pattern continues, and we can see that there are infinitely many such numbers. </think>

Given a positive integer $n=\prod_{i=1}^{s} p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$, we write $\Omega(n)$ for the total number $\sum_{i=1}^{s} \alpha_{i}$ of prime factors of $n$, counted with multiplicity. Let $\lambda(n)=(-1)^{\Omega(n)}$ (so, for example, $\left.\lambda(12)=\lambda\left(2^{2} \cdot 3^{1}\right)=(-1)^{2+1}=-1\right)$.
Prove that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $\lambda(n)=\lambda(n+1)=-1$.

","To prove that there are infinitely many positive integers \( n \) such that \( \lambda(n) = \lambda(n+1) = -1 \), we need to find a sequence of numbers where the number of prime factors (counted with multiplicity) of each number is odd, and the next number in the sequence also has an odd number of prime factors. 

Let's start by considering the form of \( n \). We need to find a sequence of numbers where the number of prime factors is odd. One way to achieve this is to use a number that is a product of an odd number of primes. 

Consider the number \( n = p_1^{2k+1} \), where \( p_1 \) is a prime number and \( k \) is a non-negative integer. This number has an odd number of prime factors (2k+1). 

Now, let's look at \( n+1 = p_1^{2k+1} + 1 \). We need to check if this number also has an odd number of prime factors. 

If \( p_1 = 2 \), then \( n = 2^{2k+1} \) and \( n+1 = 2^{2k+1} + 1 \). The number \( 2^{2k+1} + 1 \) is odd, and it is not divisible by 2, so it has an odd number of prime factors. 

If \( p_1 \) is an odd prime, then \( n = p_1^{2k+1} \) and \( n+1 = p_1^{2k+1} + 1 \). The number \( p_1^{2k+1} + 1 \) is also odd and not divisible by \( p_1 \), so it has an odd number of prime factors. 

In both cases, we have found a sequence of numbers where \( \lambda(n) = -1 \) and \( \lambda(n+1) = -1 \).

Consider an integer $n \geq 2$ and write the numbers $1,2, \ldots, n$ down on a board. A move consists in erasing any two numbers $a$ and $b$, and, for each $c$ in $\{a+b,|a-b|\}$, writing $c$ down on the board, unless $c$ is already there; if $c$ is already on the board, do nothing. For all integers $n \geq 2$, determine whether it is possible to be left with exactly two numbers on the board after a finite number of moves.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the possible outcomes of a move. We can either add or subtract two numbers, and the result of this operation, along with the absolute value of the difference, can be written on the board. The goal is to end up with exactly two numbers on the board. 

Let's start by examining the numbers we have: $1, 2, \ldots, n$. If we can get to a state where we have only two numbers, one of them must be 1, because 1 is the only number that can be the result of adding or subtracting two other numbers from the set. 

Now, let's think about how we can get to 1. We can start by considering the possibility of reaching 1 through subtraction. If we subtract 1 from 2, we get 1. This seems promising, but we need to check if we can get to 2 first. </think>
<answer> (n-1) - 1 </answer>","The answer is in the affirmative for all $n \geq 2$. Induct on $n$. Leaving aside the trivial case $n=2$, deal first with particular cases $n=5$ and $n=6$.



If $n=5$, remove first the pair $(2,5)$, notice that $3=|2-5|$ is already on the board, so $7=2+5$ alone is written down. Removal of the pair $(3,4)$ then leaves exactly two numbers on the board, 1 and 7 , since $|3 \pm 4|$ are both already there.



If $n=6$, remove first the pair $(1,6)$, notice that $5=|1-6|$ is already on the board, so $7=1+6$ alone is written down. Next, remove the pair $(2,5)$ and notice that $|2 \pm 5|$ are both already on the board, so no new number is written down. Finally, removal of the pair $(3,4)$ provides a single number to be written down, $1=|3-4|$, since $7=3+4$ is already on the board. At this stage, the process comes to an end: 1 and 7 are the two numbers left.



In the remaining cases, the problem for $n$ is brought down to the corresponding problem for $[n / 2\rceil<n$ by a finite number of moves. The conclusion then follows by induction.



Let $n=4 k$ or $4 k-1$, where $k$ is a positive integer. Remove the pairs $(1,4 k-1),(3,4 k-3), \ldots$, $(2 k-1,2 k+1)$ in turn. Each time, two odd numbers are removed, and the corresponding $c=|a \pm b|$ are even numbers in the range 2 through $4 k$, of which one is always $4 k$. These even numbers are already on the board at each stage, so no $c$ is to be written down, unless $n=4 k-1$ in which case $4 k$ is written down during the first move. The outcome of this $k$-move round is the string of even numbers 2 through $4 k$ written down on the board. At this stage, the problem is clearly brought down to the case where the numbers on the board are $1,2, \ldots, 2 k=\lceil n / 2\rceil$, as desired.



Finally, let $n=4 k+1$ or $4 k+2$, where $k \geq 2$. Remove first the pair $(4,2 k+1)$ and notice that no new number is to be written down on the board, since $4+(2 k+1)=2 k+5 \leq 4 k+1 \leq n$. Next, remove the pairs $(1,4 k+1),(3,4 k-1), \ldots,(2 k-1,2 k+3)$ in turn. As before, at each of these stages, two odd numbers are removed; the corresponding $c=|a \pm b|$ are even numbers, this time in the range 4 through $4 k+2$, of which one is always $4 k+2$; and no new numbers are to be written down on the board, except $4=|(2 k-1)-(2 k+3)|$ during the last move, and, possibly, $4 k+2=1+(4 k+1)$ during the first move if $n=4 k+1$. Notice that 2 has not yet been involved in the process, to conclude that the outcome of this $(k+1)$-move round is the string of even numbers 2 through $4 k+2$ written down on the board. At this stage, the problem is clearly brought down to the case where the numbers on the board are $1,2, \ldots, 2 k+1=\lceil n / 2\rceil$, as desired.",0,False,205

Let $n$ be a positive integer. The kingdom of Zoomtopia is a convex polygon with integer sides, perimeter $6 n$, and $60^{\circ}$ rotational symmetry (that is, there is a point $O$ such that a $60^{\circ}$ rotation about $O$ maps the polygon to itself). In light of the pandemic, the government of Zoomtopia would like to relocate its $3 n^{2}+3 n+1$ citizens at $3 n^{2}+3 n+1$ points in the kingdom so that every two citizens have a distance of at least 1 for proper social distancing. Prove that this is possible. (The kingdom is assumed to contain its boundary.)
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the polygon. Given that the polygon has a $60^\circ$ rotational symmetry and a perimeter of $6n$, it must be a regular hexagon. This is because a regular hexagon is the only convex polygon that can have a $60^\circ$ rotational symmetry and a perimeter that is a multiple of 6. 

Next, we need to place $3n^2 + 3n + 1$ points in the hexagon such that the distance between any two points is at least 1. Let's start by considering the vertices of the hexagon. There are 6 vertices, and we can place one point at each vertex. This uses up 6 points, leaving us with $3n^2 + 3n + 1 - 6 = 3n^2 + 3n - 5$ points to place. 

Now, we need to place these remaining points in the hexagon. One way to do this is to consider the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon. A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, and the midpoints of the sides of these triangles are points that are exactly 1 unit away from the vertices. By placing these midpoints, we can use up another $3n$ points, leaving us with $3n - 5$ points to place. 

Finally, we need to place the last $3n - 5$ points. We can consider placing these points in the interior of the hexagon, specifically in the regions that are not already occupied by the vertices or midpoints. Since the hexagon is divided into 6 regions by its sides, and we have already used up 3 regions with the vertices and midpoints, we can place the remaining points in the other 3 regions, ensuring that the distance between any two points is at least 1. </think>
<answer> Place the vertices of the hexagon, then the midpoints of the sides, and finally, the remaining points in the interior of the hexagon. </answer>","Let $P$ denote the given polygon, i.e., the kingdom of Zoomtopia. Throughout the solution, we interpret polygons with integer sides and perimeter $6 k$ as $6 k$-gons with unit sides (some of their angles may equal $180^{\circ}$ ). The argument hinges on the claim below:



Claim. Let $P$ be a convex polygon satisfying the problem conditions - i.e., it has integer sides, perimeter $6 n$, and $60^{\circ}$ rotational symmetry. Then $P$ can be tiled with unit equilateral triangles and unit lozenges with angles at least $60^{\circ}$, with tiles meeting completely along edges, so that the tile configuration has a total of exactly $3 n^{2}+3 n+1$ distinct vertices.



Proof. Induct on $n$. The base case, $n=1$, is clear.



Now take a polygon $P$ of perimeter $6 n \geq 12$. Place six equilateral triangles inwards on six edges corresponding to each other upon rotation at $60^{\circ}$. It is possible to stick a lozenge to each other edge, as shown in the Figure below.



We show that all angles of the lozenges are at least $60^{\circ}$. Let an edge $X Y$ of the polygon bearing some lozenge lie along a boundary segment between edges $A B$ and $C D$ bearing equilateral triangles $A B P$ and $C D Q$. Then the angle formed by $\overrightarrow{X Y}$ and $\overrightarrow{B P}$ is between those formed by $\overrightarrow{A B}, \overrightarrow{B P}$ and $\overrightarrow{C D}, \overrightarrow{C Q}$, i.e., between $60^{\circ}$ and $120^{\circ}$, as desired.



Removing all obtained tiles, we get a $60^{\circ}$-symmetric convex $6(n-1)$-gon with unit sides which can be tiled by the inductive hypothesis. Finally, the number of vertices in the tiling of $P$ is $6 n+3(n-1)^{2}+3(n-1)+1=3 n^{2}+3 n+1$, as desired.



<img_3493>



Using the Claim above, we now show that the citizens may be placed at the $3 n^{2}+3 n+1$ tile vertices.



Consider any tile $T_{1}$; its vertices are at least 1 apart from each other. Moreover, let $B A C$ be a part of the boundary of some tile $T$, and let $X$ be any point of the boundary of $T$, lying outside the half-open intervals $[A, B)$ and $[A, C)$ (in this case, we say that $X$ is not adjacent to $A$ ). Then $A X \geq \sqrt{3} / 2$.



Now consider any two tile vertices $A$ and $B$. If they are vertices of the same tile we already know $A B \geq 1$; otherwise, the segment $A B$ crosses the boundaries of some tiles containing $A$ and $B$ at some points $X$ and $Y$ not adjacent to $A$ and $B$, respectively. Hence $A B \geq A X+Y B \geq \sqrt{3}>1$.",0,False,432

Does there exist a pair $(g, h)$ of functions $g, h: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that the only function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(g(x))=g(f(x))$ and $f(h(x))=h(f(x))$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ is the identity function $f(x) \equiv x$ ?
Assistant: <think>
","To determine if there exists a pair of functions \( g \) and \( h \) such that the only function \( f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) satisfying \( f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) \) and \( f(h(x)) = h(f(x)) \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) is the identity function, we need to consider the properties of such functions and the constraints they impose on \( f \).

First, let's consider the implications of the given conditions. The conditions \( f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) \) and \( f(h(x)) = h(f(x)) \) suggest that \( g \) and \( h \) are in some sense ""compatible"" with \( f \). If we can find a pair \( g \) and \( h \) that make \( f \) the only solution, then we have our answer.

One approach is to consider the possibility that \( g \) and \( h \) are linear functions. If we assume \( g(x) = ax + b \) and \( h(x) = cx + d \), then the conditions become:
1. \( f(ax + b) = a f(x) + b \)
2. \( f(cx + d) = c f(x) + d \)

If we can find a function \( f \) that satisfies these conditions, then it must be the identity function. Let's try to find such an \( f \).

If we assume \( f(x) = kx + m \), then substituting into the conditions, we get:
1. \( k(ax + b) + m = a(kx + m) + b \)
2. \( k(cx + d) + m = c(kx + m) + d \)

Simplifying these, we get:
1. \( kax + kb + m = kx + am + b \)
2. \( kcx + kd + m = kx + cm + d \)

For these to hold for all \( x \), the coefficients of \( x \) and the constant terms must match. This gives us:
1. \( ka = k \) and \( kb + m = am + b \)
2. \( kc = k \) and \( kd + m = cm + d \)

From the first set, we get \( k = 1 \) or \( k = 0 \). If \( k = 0 \), then the second equation simplifies to \( m = b \), which is not generally true. So, \( k = 1 \).

From the second set, we get \( c = 1 \) or \( c = 0 \). If \( c = 0 \), then the second equation simplifies to \( m = d \), which is not generally true. So, \( c = 1 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( g(x) = x \) and \( h(x) = x \), which means the only function \( f \) that satisfies the conditions is the identity function. </think>
<answer> (g(x) = x, h(x) = x) </answer>","Such a tester pair exists. We may biject $\mathbb{R}$ with the closed unit interval, so it suffices to find a tester pair for that instead. We give an explicit example: take some positive real numbers $\alpha, \beta$ (which we will specify further later). Take



$$

g(x)=\max (x-\alpha, 0) \quad \text { and } \quad h(x)=\min (x+\beta, 1)

$$15



Say a set $S \subseteq[0,1]$ is invariant if $f(S) \subseteq S$ for all functions $f$ commuting with both $g$ and $h$. Note that intersections and unions of invariant sets are invariant. Preimages of invariant sets under $g$ and $h$ are also invariant; indeed, if $S$ is invariant and, say, $T=g^{-1}(S)$, then $g(f(T))=$ $f(g(T)) \subseteq f(S) \subseteq S$, thus $f(T) \subseteq T$.



We claim that (if we choose $\alpha+\beta<1$ ) the intervals $[0, n \alpha-m \beta]$ are invariant where $n$ and $m$ are nonnegative integers with $0 \leq n \alpha-m \beta \leq 1$. We prove this by induction on $m+n$.



The set $\{0\}$ is invariant, as for any $f$ commuting with $g$ we have $g(f(0))=f(g(0))=f(0)$, so $f(0)$ is a fixed point of $g$. This gives that $f(0)=0$, thus the induction base is established.



Suppose now we have some $m, n$ such that $\left[0, n^{\prime} \alpha-m^{\prime} \beta\right]$ is invariant whenever $m^{\prime}+n^{\prime}<$ $m+n$. At least one of the numbers $(n-1) \alpha-m \beta$ and $n \alpha-(m-1) \beta$ lies in $(0,1)$. Note however that in the first case $[0, n \alpha-m \beta]=g^{-1}([0,(n-1) \alpha-m \beta])$, so $[0, n \alpha-m \beta]$ is invariant. In the second case $[0, n \alpha-m \beta]=h^{-1}([0, n \alpha-(m-1) \beta])$, so again $[0, n \alpha-m \beta]$ is invariant. This completes the induction.



We claim that if we choose $\alpha+\beta<1$, where $0<\alpha \notin \mathbb{Q}$ and $\beta=1 / k$ for some integer $k>1$, then all intervals $[0, \delta]$ are invariant for $0 \leq \delta<1$. This occurs, as by the previous claim, for all nonnegative integers $n$ we have $[0,(n \alpha \bmod 1)]$ is invariant. The set of $n \alpha \bmod 1$ is dense in $[0,1]$, so in particular



$$

[0, \delta]=\bigcap_{(n \alpha \bmod 1)>\delta}[0,(n \alpha \bmod 1)]

$$



is invariant.



A similar argument establishes that $[\delta, 1]$ is invariant, so by intersecting these $\{\delta\}$ is invariant for $0<\delta<1$. Yet we also have $\{0\},\{1\}$ both invariant, which proves $f$ to be the identity.",0,True,672

Let $A B C D$ be a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle $\omega$. The lines $A B$ and $C D$ meet at $P$, the lines $A D$ and $B C$ meet at $Q$, and the diagonals $A C$ and $B D$ meet at $R$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of the segment $P Q$, and let $K$ be the common point of the segment $M R$ and the circle $\omega$. Prove that the circumcircle of the triangle $K P Q$ and $\omega$ are tangent to one another.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the quadrilateral $ABCD$ inscribed in the circle $\omega$. The points $P$, $Q$, and $R$ are the intersections of the lines $AB$ and $CD$, $AD$ and $BC$, and the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$, respectively. The point $M$ is the midpoint of the segment $PQ$. We need to show that the circumcircle of the triangle $KPQ$ is tangent to the circle $\omega$ at point $K$.

Since $K$ is the intersection of $MR$ and $\omega$, and $M$ is the midpoint of $PQ$, we can use the fact that $K$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $PQ$ (as $M$ does). This means that $K$ is equidistant from $P$ and $Q$. 

Now, let's consider the circumcircle of $\triangle KPQ$. Since $K$ is on the circle $\omega$ and $K$ is the midpoint of the arc $PQ$ not containing $R$, the angle $\angle PKQ$ is a right angle (90 degrees). This is because the angle subtended by a diameter in a circle is a right angle. 

Since $K$ is on the circle $\omega$ and the angle $\angle PKQ$ is a right angle, the circle $\omega$ is tangent to the circumcircle of $\triangle KPQ$ at point $K$. This is because the radius of the circle $\omega$ at $K$ is perpendicular to the tangent line at $K$, which is the circumcircle of $\triangle KPQ$.

</think>
<answer> The circumcircle of the triangle $KPQ$ and the circle $\omega$ are tangent to one another at point $K$. </answer>","Let $O$ be the centre of $\omega$. Notice that the points $P, Q$, and $R$ are the poles (with respect to $\omega$ ) of the lines $Q R, R P$, and $P Q$, respectively. Hence we have $O P \perp Q R, O Q \perp R P$, and $O R \perp P Q$, thus $R$ is the orthocentre of the triangle $O P Q$. Now, if $M R \perp P Q$, then the points $P$ and $Q$ are the reflections of one another in the line $M R=M O$, and the triangle $P Q K$ is symmetrical with respect to this line. In this case the statement of the problem is trivial.



Otherwise, let $V$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $O$ to $M R$, and let $U$ be the common point of the lines $O V$ and $P Q$. Since $U$ lies on the polar line of $R$ and $O U \perp M R$, we obtain that $U$ is the pole of $M R$. Therefore, the line $U K$ is tangent to $\omega$. Hence it is enough to prove that $U K^{2}=U P \cdot U Q$, since this relation implies that $U K$ is also tangent to the circle $K P Q$.



From the rectangular triangle $O K U$, we get $U K^{2}=U V \cdot U O$. Let $\Omega$ be the circumcircle of triangle $O P Q$, and let $R^{\prime}$ be the reflection of its orthocentre $R$ in the midpoint $M$ of the side $P Q$. It is well known that $R^{\prime}$ is the point of $\Omega$ opposite to $O$, hence $O R^{\prime}$ is the diameter of $\Omega$. Finally, since $\angle O V R^{\prime}=90^{\circ}$, the point $V$ also lies on $\Omega$, hence $U P \cdot U Q=U V \cdot U O=U K^{2}$, as required.

","To determine if there exists an infinite sequence of positive integers \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\) such that \(a_m\) and \(a_n\) are coprime if and only if \(|m-n|=1\), we need to consider the properties of coprime numbers and the constraints given by the problem. 

First, let's consider the possibility of constructing such a sequence. We need to ensure that for any two indices \(m\) and \(n\), if \(|m-n|=1\), then \(a_m\) and \(a_n\) are coprime, and if \(|m-n|>1\), then \(a_m\) and \(a_n\) are not coprime. 

One approach is to consider the sequence where each term is a prime number. If we take the sequence of prime numbers, say \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \ldots\), then any two consecutive terms are coprime. However, this sequence is not infinite, and it does not satisfy the condition for \(|m-n|>1\).

Another approach is to consider a sequence where each term is a product of two distinct primes. For example, if we take the sequence \(2 \cdot 3, 2 \cdot 5, 2 \cdot 7, 3 \cdot 5, 3 \cdot 7, 5 \cdot 7, \ldots\), then any two consecutive terms are coprime, but the terms themselves are not coprime to each other. </think>

The idea is to consider a sequence of pairwise distinct primes $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, \ldots$, cover the positive integers by a sequence of finite non-empty sets $I_{n}$ such that $I_{m}$ and $I_{n}$ are disjoint if and only if $m$ and $n$ are one unit apart, and set $a_{n}=\prod_{i \in I_{n}} p_{i}, n=1,2,3, \ldots$



One possible way of finding such sets is the following. For all positive integers $n$, let



$$

\begin{aligned}

& 2 n \in I_{k} \quad \text { for all } k=n, n+3, n+5, n+7, \ldots ; \quad \text { and } \\

& 2 n-1 \in I_{k} \quad \text { for all } k=n, n+2, n+4, n+6, \ldots

\end{aligned}

$$



Clearly, each $I_{k}$ is finite, since it contains none of the numbers greater than $2 k$. Next, the number $p_{2 n}$ ensures that $I_{n}$ has a common element with each $I_{n+2 i}$, while the number $p_{2 n-1}$ ensures that $I_{n}$ has a common element with each $I_{n+2 i+1}$ for $i=1,2, \ldots$. Finally, none of the indices appears in two consecutive sets.",0,False,4814

A finite list of rational numbers is written on a blackboard. In an operation, we choose any two numbers $a, b$, erase them, and write down one of the numbers



$$

a+b, a-b, b-a, a \times b, a / b(\text { if } b \neq 0), b / a(\text { if } a \neq 0)

$$



Prove that, for every integer $n>100$, there are only finitely many integers $k \geq 0$, such that, starting from the list



$$

k+1, k+2, \ldots, k+n

$$



it is possible to obtain, after $n-1$ operations, the value $n$ !.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the operations we can perform. We can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers from the list. The goal is to reach the value $n$ using the list $k+1, k+2, \ldots, k+n$ after $n-1$ operations. 

Let's start by examining the operations that can lead us closer to $n$. Adding or subtracting two numbers from the list can only result in a number that is close to $n$ but not exactly $n$. Multiplying or dividing two numbers from the list can also lead us away from $n$ unless we are very careful. 

A key observation is that if we can reach $n$ by adding or subtracting, we need to be very close to $n$ to make it work. For example, if we have $k+1$ and $k+n$, adding them gives $k+n+1$, which is too large. Subtracting them gives $k+n-1$, which is too small. </think>

all positive integer $n$.



There are only finitely many ways of constructing a number from $n$ pairwise distinct numbers $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}$ only using the four elementary arithmetic operations, and each $x_{k}$ exactly once. Each such formula for $k>1$ is obtained by an elementary operation from two such formulas on two disjoint sets of the $x_{i}$.



A straightforward induction on $n$ shows that the outcome of each such construction is a number of the form



$$

\frac{\sum_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n} \in\{0,1\}} a_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}} x_{1}^{\alpha_{1}} \cdots x_{n}^{\alpha_{n}}}{\sum_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n} \in\{0,1\}} b_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}} x_{1}^{\alpha_{1}} \cdots x_{n}^{\alpha_{n}}},
\tag{*}
$$



where the $a_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}}$ and $b_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}}$ are all in the set $\{0, \pm 1\}$, not all zero of course, $a_{0, \ldots, 0}=b_{1, \ldots, 1}=0$, and also $a_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}} \cdot b_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}}=0$ for every set of indices.



Since $\left|a_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}}\right| \leq 1$, and $a_{0,0, \ldots, 0}=0$, the absolute value of the numerator does not exceed $\left(1+\left|x_{1}\right|\right) \cdots\left(1+\left|x_{n}\right|\right)-1$; in particular, if $c$ is an integer in the range $-n, \ldots,-1$, and $x_{k}=c+k$, $k=1, \ldots, n$, then the absolute value of the numerator is at most $(-c) !(n+c+1) !-1 \leq n !-1<n !$.



Consider now the integral polynomials,



$$

P=\sum_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n} \in\{0,1\}} a_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}}(X+1)^{\alpha_{1}} \cdots(X+n)^{\alpha_{n}}

$$



and



$$

Q=\sum_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n} \in\{0,1\}} b_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}}(X+1)^{\alpha_{1}} \cdots(X+n)^{\alpha_{n}}

$$



where the $a_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}}$ and $b_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}}$ are all in the set $\{0, \pm 1\}$, not all zero, $a_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}} b_{\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}}=0$ for every set of indices, and $a_{0, \ldots, 0}=b_{1, \ldots, 1}=0$. By the preceding, $|P(c)|<n$ ! for every integer $c$ in the range $-n, \ldots,-1$; and since $b_{1, \ldots, 1}=0$, the degree of $Q$ is less than $n$.



Since every non-zero polynomial has only finitely many roots, and the number of roots does not exceed the degree, to complete the proof it is sufficient to show that the polynomial $P-n ! Q$ does not vanish identically, provided that $Q$ does not (which is the case in the problem).



Suppose, if possible, that $P=n ! Q$, where $Q \neq 0$. Since $\operatorname{deg} Q<n$, it follows that $\operatorname{deg} P<n$ as well, and since $P \neq 0$, the number of roots of $P$ does not exceed $\operatorname{deg} P<n$, so $P(c) \neq 0$ for some integer $c$ in the range $-n, \ldots,-1$. By the preceding, $|P(c)|$ is consequently a positive integer less than $n$ !. On the other hand, $|P(c)|=n !|Q(c)|$ is an integral multiple of $n$ !. A contradiction.",0,False,4705

In the Cartesian plane, let $\mathcal{G}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{G}_{2}$ be the graphs of the quadratic functions $f_{1}(x)=p_{1} x^{2}+q_{1} x+r_{1}$ and $f_{2}(x)=p_{2} x^{2}+q_{2} x+r_{2}$, where $p_{1}>0>p_{2}$.

The four tangents to $\mathcal{G}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{G}_{2}$ at $A$ and $B$ form a convex quadrilateral which has an inscribed circle. Prove that the graphs $\mathcal{G}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{G}_{2}$ have the same axis of symmetry.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that the graphs \(\mathcal{G}_{1}\) and \(\mathcal{G}_{2}\) have the same axis of symmetry, we need to consider the properties of the tangents and the quadrilateral formed by these tangents. The key observation is that the tangents to the parabolas at points \(A\) and \(B\) form a quadrilateral with an inscribed circle, which implies that the sum of the opposite angles of this quadrilateral is 180 degrees. This is a characteristic of tangents to a circle, and since the quadrilateral is convex, it must be a tangential quadrilateral.

Given that the parabolas are \(f_1(x) = p_1 x^2 + q_1 x + r_1\) and \(f_2(x) = p_2 x^2 + q_2 x + r_2\), and they intersect at points \(A\) and \(B\), the tangents at these points are given by the derivatives of the functions at these points. The derivative of \(f_1(x)\) is \(f_1'(x) = 2p_1 x + q_1\), and the derivative of \(f_2(x)\) is \(f_2'(x) = 2p_2 x + q_2\).

The tangents at points \(A\) and \(B\) are:
- For \(\mathcal{G}_1\), the tangents are at \(x = x_1\) and \(x = x_2\), where \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are the x-coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\).
- For \(\mathcal{G}_2\), the tangents are at \(x = x_3\) and \(x = x_4\), where \(x_3\) and \(x_4\) are the x-coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\).

Since the tangents form a tangential quadrilateral, the sum of the opposite angles of this quadrilateral is 180 degrees. This implies that the tangents at the points of intersection are symmetric with respect to the axis of symmetry of the parabolas. 

Given that \(p_1 > 0 > p_2\), the parabolas \(\mathcal{G}_1\) and \(\mathcal{G}_2\) open in opposite directions. The only way for the tangents to form a tangential quadrilateral with the same sum of opposite angles is if the parabolas have the same axis of symmetry. This is because the symmetry of the tangents at the points of intersection would be preserved only if the parabolas themselves are symmetric about the same line.

\(\boxed{\text{The graphs } \mathcal{G}_1 \text{ and } \mathcal{G}_2 \text{ have the same axis of symmetry.} \)","Let $\mathcal{A}_{i}$ and $\mathcal{B}_{i}$ be the tangents to $\mathcal{G}_{i}$ at $A$ and $B$, respectively, and let $C_{i}=\mathcal{A}_{i} \cap \mathcal{B}_{i}$. Since $f_{1}(x)$ is convex and $f_{2}(x)$ is concave, the convex quadrangle formed by the four tangents is exactly $A C_{1} B C_{2}$.



Lemma. If $C A$ and $C B$ are the tangents drawn from a point $C$ to the graph $\mathcal{G}$ of a quadratic trinomial $f(x)=p x^{2}+q x+r, A, B \in \mathcal{G}, A \neq B$, then the abscissa of $C$ is the arithmetic mean of the abscissae of $A$ and $B$.



Proof. Assume, without loss of generality, that $C$ is at the origin, so the equations of the two tangents have the form $y=k_{a} x$ and $y=k_{b} x$. Next, the abscissae $x_{A}$ and $x_{B}$ of the tangency points $A$ and $B$, respectively, are multiple roots of the polynomials $f(x)-k_{a} x$ and $f(x)-k_{b} x$, respectively. By the Vieta theorem, $x_{A}^{2}=r / p=x_{B}^{2}$, so $x_{A}=-x_{B}$, since the case $x_{A}=x_{B}$ is ruled out by $A \neq B$.

<img_3615>



The Lemma shows that the line $C_{1} C_{2}$ is parallel to the $y$-axis and the points $A$ and $B$ are equidistant from this line.



Suppose, if possible, that the incentre $O$ of the quadrangle $A C_{1} B C_{2}$ does not lie on the line $C_{1} C_{2}$. Assume, without loss of generality, that $O$ lies inside the triangle $A C_{1} C_{2}$ and let $A^{\prime}$ be the reflection of $A$ in the line $C_{1} C_{2}$. Then the ray $C_{i} B$ emanating from $C_{i}$ lies inside the angle $A C_{i} A^{\prime}$, so $B$ lies inside the quadrangle $A C_{1} A^{\prime} C_{2}$, whence $A$ and $B$ are not equidistant from $C_{1} C_{2}$ - a contradiction.



Thus $O$ lies on $C_{1} C_{2}$, so the lines $A C_{i}$ and $B C_{i}$ are reflections of one another in the line $C_{1} C_{2}$, and $B=A^{\prime}$. Hence $y_{A}=y_{B}$, and since $f_{i}(x)=y_{A}+p_{i}\left(x-x_{A}\right)\left(x-x_{B}\right)$, the line $C_{1} C_{2}$ is the axis of symmetry of both parabolas, as required.",0,False,620

Let $A B C D$ be any convex quadrilateral and let $P, Q, R, S$ be points on the segments $A B, B C, C D$, and $D A$, respectively. It is given that the segments $P R$ and $Q S$ dissect $A B C D$ into four quadrilaterals, each of which has perpendicular diagonals. Show that the points $P, Q, R, S$ are concyclic.
Assistant: <think>
","To show that the points \(P, Q, R, S\) are concyclic, we need to consider the properties of the quadrilaterals formed by the segments \(P R\) and \(Q S\). Given that each of the four quadrilaterals formed by these segments has perpendicular diagonals, we can use the fact that the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral are perpendicular if and only if the quadrilateral is a kite or a specific type of cyclic quadrilateral.

Let's analyze the quadrilaterals formed by the segments \(P R\) and \(Q S\). We have four quadrilaterals: \(APRQ\), \(BPRQ\), \(BRSQ\), and \(DSRQ\). Since each of these quadrilaterals has perpendicular diagonals, we can infer that the diagonals of each quadrilateral are perpendicular to each other. 

Now, let's consider the possibility that the points \(P, Q, R, S\) are concyclic. If they are, then the quadrilateral formed by any four of these points (say \(PQRS\)) would also have perpendicular diagonals. 

To confirm this, we can use the fact that the perpendicularity of the diagonals in each of the four quadrilaterals implies a specific geometric relationship among the points. Specifically, the perpendicularity of the diagonals in each quadrilateral suggests that the points are arranged in a way that the circle passing through them would have the required properties. 

Thus, the points \(P, Q, R, S\) must be concyclic to satisfy the condition that each of the four quadrilaterals formed by the segments \(P R\) and \(Q S\) has perpendicular diagonals. </think>
<answer> The points \(P, Q, R, S\) are concyclic. </answer>","We start with a lemma which holds even in a more general setup.



Lemma 1. Let $P Q R S$ be a convex quadrangle whose diagonals meet at $O$. Let $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ be the circles on diameters $P Q$ and $R S$, respectively, and let $\ell$ be their radical axis. Finally, choose the points $A, B$, and $C$ outside this quadrangle so that: the point $P$ (respectively, $Q$ ) lies on the segment $A B$ (respectively, $B C$ ); and $A O \perp P S, B O \perp P Q$, and $C O \perp Q R$. Then the three lines $A C, P Q$, and $\ell$ are concurrent or parallel.



Proof. Assume first that the lines $P R$ and $Q S$ are not perpendicular. Let $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ be the orthocentres of the triangles $O S P$ and $O Q R$, respectively; notice that $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ do not coincide.



Since $H_{1}$ is the radical centre of the circles on diameters $R S, S P$, and $P Q$, it lies on $\ell$. Similarly, $H_{2}$ lies on $\ell$, so the lines $H_{1} H_{2}$ and $\ell$ coincide.



The corresponding sides of the triangles $A P H_{1}$ and $C Q H_{2}$ meet at $O, B$, and the orthocentre of the triangle $O P Q$ (which lies on $O B$ ). By Desargues' theorem, the lines $A C, P Q$ and $\ell$ are concurrent or parallel.



<img_3558>



The case when $P R \perp Q S$ may be considered as a limit case, since the configuration in the statement of the lemma allows arbitrarily small perturbations. The lemma is proved.



Back to the problem, let the segments $P R$ and $Q S$ cross at $O$, let $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ be the circles on diameters $P Q$ and $R S$, respectively, and let $\ell$ be their radical axis. By the Lemma, the three lines $A C, \ell$, and $P Q$ are concurrent or parallel, and similarly so are the three lines $A C, \ell$, and $R S$. Thus, if the lines $A C$ and $\ell$ are distinct, all four lines are concurrent or pairwise parallel.



This is clearly the case when the lines $P S$ and $Q R$ are not parallel (since $\ell$ crosses $O A$ and $O C$ at the orthocentres of $O S P$ and $O Q R$, these orthocentres being distinct from $A$ and $C$ ). In this case, denote the concurrency point by $T$. If $T$ is not ideal, then we have $T P \cdot T Q=T R \cdot T S$ (as $T \in \ell$ ), so $P Q R S$ is cyclic. If $T$ is ideal (i.e., all four lines are parallel), then the segments $P Q$ and $R S$ have the same perpendicular bisector (namely, the line of centers of $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ ), and $P Q R S$ is cyclic again.



Assume now $P S$ and $Q R$ parallel. By symmetry, $P Q$ and $R S$ may also be assumed parallel: otherwise, the preceding argument goes through after relabelling. In this case, we need to prove that the parallelogram $P Q R S$ is a rectangle.







<img_3452>



Suppose, by way of contradiction, that $O P>O Q$. Let the line through $O$ and parallel to $P Q$ meet $A B$ at $M$, and $C B$ at $N$. Since $O P>O Q$, the angle $S P Q$ is acute and the angle $P Q R$ is obtuse, so the angle $A O B$ is obtuse, the angle $B O C$ is acute, $M$ lies on the segment $A B$, and $N$ lies on the extension of the segment $B C$ beyond $C$. Therefore: $O A>O M$, since the angle $O M A$ is obtuse; $O M>O N$, since $O M: O N=K P: K Q$, where $K$ is the projection of $O$ onto $P Q$; and $O N>O C$, since the angle $O C N$ is obtuse. Consequently, $O A>O C$.



Similarly, $O R>O S$ yields $O C>O A$ : a contradiction. Consequently, $O P=O Q$ and $P Q R S$ is a rectangle. This ends the proof.",0,False,372

Let $a, b, c, d$ be positive integers such that $a d \neq b c$ and $\operatorname{gcd}(a, b, c, d)=1$. Prove that, as $n$ runs through the positive integers, the values $\operatorname{gcd}(a n+b, c n+d)$ may achieve form the set of all positive divisors of some integer.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression \(\operatorname{gcd}(a n + b, c n + d)\). We need to show that this expression can take on any positive divisor of some integer. 

Given that \(\operatorname{gcd}(a, b, c, d) = 1\), we can use the properties of the greatest common divisor to our advantage. Let's start by considering the expression when \(n = 1\):
\[
\operatorname{gcd}(a + b, c + d)
\]
This is a valid expression since \(a, b, c, d\) are positive integers. Now, we need to show that \(\operatorname{gcd}(a + b, c + d)\) can be any positive divisor of some integer. 

To do this, we can use the fact that the greatest common divisor of two numbers can be any divisor of their linear combination. Specifically, if we can find a number \(k\) such that \(\operatorname{gcd}(a + b, c + d) = k\), then \(k\) is a divisor of \((a + b)(c + d)\). </think>
<answer> k \cdot \operatorname{gcd}(a + b, c + d) </answer>","We extend the problem statement by allowing $a$ and $c$ take non-negative integer values, and allowing $b$ and $d$ to take arbitrary integer values. (As usual, the greatest common divisor of two integers is non-negative.) Without loss of generality, we assume $0 \leq a \leq c$. Let $S(a, b, c, d)=\left\{\operatorname{gcd}(a n+b, c n+d): n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}\right\}$.

Now we induct on $a$. We first deal with the inductive step, leaving the base case $a=0$ to the end of the solution. So, assume that $a>0$; we intend to find a 4 -tuple $\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}, c^{\prime}, d^{\prime}\right)$ satisfying the requirements of the extended problem, such that $S\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}, c^{\prime}, d^{\prime}\right)=S(a, b, c, d)$ and $0 \leq a^{\prime}<a$, which will allow us to apply the induction hypothesis.

The construction of this 4-tuple is provided by the step of the Euclidean algorithm. Write $c=a q+r$, where $q$ and $r$ are both integers and $0 \leq r<a$. Then for every $n$ we have

$$
\operatorname{gcd}(a n+b, c n+d)=\operatorname{gcd}(a n+b, q(a n+b)+r n+d-q b)=\operatorname{gcd}(a n+b, r n+(d-q b)) \text {, }
$$

so a natural intention is to define $a^{\prime}=r, b^{\prime}=d-q b, c^{\prime}=a$, and $d^{\prime}=b$ (which are already shown to satisfy $\left.S\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}, c^{\prime}, d^{\prime}\right)=S(a, b, c, d)\right)$. The check of the problem requirements is straightforward: indeed,

$$
a^{\prime} d^{\prime}-b^{\prime} c^{\prime}=(c-q a) b-(d-q b) a=-(a d-b c) \neq 0
$$

and

$$
\operatorname{gcd}\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}, c^{\prime}, d^{\prime}\right)=\operatorname{gcd}(c-q a, b-q d, a, b)=\operatorname{gcd}(c, d, a, b)=1 .
$$

Thus the step is verified.

It remains to deal with the base case $a=0$, i.e., to examine the set $S(0, b, c, d)$ with $b c \neq 0$ and $\operatorname{gcd}(b, c, d)=1$. Let $b^{\prime}$ be the integer obtained from $b$ by ignoring all primes $b$ and $c$ share (none of them divides $c n+d$ for any integer $n$, otherwise $\operatorname{gcd}(b, c, d)>1)$. We thus $\operatorname{get} \operatorname{gcd}\left(b^{\prime}, c\right)=1$ and $S\left(0, b^{\prime}, c, d\right)=S(0, b, c, d)$.

Finally, it is easily seen that $S\left(0, b^{\prime}, c, d\right)$ is the set of all positive divisors of $b^{\prime}$. Each member of $S\left(0, b^{\prime}, c, d\right)$ is clearly a divisor of $b^{\prime}$. Conversely, if $\delta$ is a positive divisor of $b^{\prime}$, then $c n+d \equiv \delta$ $\left(\bmod b^{\prime}\right)$ for some $n$, since $b^{\prime}$ and $c$ are coprime, so $\delta$ is indeed a member of $S\left(0, b^{\prime}, c, d\right)$.",0,False,267

Fix a circle $\Gamma$, a line $\ell$ tangent to $\Gamma$, and another circle $\Omega$ disjoint from $\ell$ such that $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$ lie on opposite sides of $\ell$. The tangents to $\Gamma$ from a variable point $X$ on $\Omega$ cross $\ell$ at $Y$ and $Z$. Prove that, as $X$ traces $\Omega$, the circle $X Y Z$ is tangent to two fixed circles.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric configuration. We have a circle $\Gamma$ and a line $\ell$ tangent to $\Gamma$. Another circle $\Omega$ is disjoint from $\ell$ and lies on the opposite side of $\ell$ from $\Gamma$. We need to show that the circle $XYZ$ (formed by the tangents from a variable point $X$ on $\Omega$ to $\Gamma$) is tangent to two fixed circles as $X$ traces $\Omega$.

Let's start by considering the tangents from a point $X$ on $\Omega$ to $\Gamma$. These tangents will intersect the line $\ell$ at points $Y$ and $Z$. The circle $XYZ$ is the circle that passes through these points $Y$ and $Z$ and is tangent to the line $\ell$.

Now, let's think about the fixed circles. Since $\Omega$ is a circle that is disjoint from $\ell$ and lies on the opposite side of $\ell$ from $\Gamma$, the tangents from $X$ to $\Gamma$ will always intersect $\ell$ at points that are symmetric with respect to the line passing through the center of $\Gamma$ and perpendicular to $\ell$. This means that the circle $XYZ$ will always be tangent to the circle that is the reflection of $\Gamma$ across the line perpendicular to $\ell$ passing through the center of $\Gamma$.

Additionally, the circle $XYZ$ will also be tangent to the circle that is the reflection of $\Omega$ across the line perpendicular to $\ell$ passing through the center of $\Gamma$. This is because the tangents from $X$ to $\Gamma$ will always be symmetric with respect to this line, and the points $Y$ and $Z$ will be symmetric with respect to the line perpendicular to $\ell$ passing through the center of $\Gamma$.

</think>
<answer> The circle $XYZ$ is tangent to the circle that is the reflection of $\Gamma$ across the line perpendicular to $\ell$ passing through the center of $\Gamma$, and the circle that is the reflection of $\Omega$ across the same line. </answer>","Assume $\Gamma$ of unit radius and invert with respect to $\Gamma$. No reference will be made to the original configuration, so images will be denoted by the same letters. Letting $\Gamma$ be centred at $G$, notice that inversion in $\Gamma$ maps tangents to $\Gamma$ to circles of unit diameter through $G$ (hence internally tangent to $\Gamma$ ). Under inversion, the statement reads as follows:

Fix a circle $\Gamma$ of unit radius centred at $G$, a circle $\ell$ of unit diameter through $G$, and a circle $\Omega$ inside $\ell$ disjoint from $\ell$. The circles $\eta$ and $\zeta$ of unit diameter, through $G$ and a variable point $X$ on $\Omega$, cross $\ell$ again at $Y$ and $Z$, respectively. Prove that, as $X$ traces $\Omega$, the circle $X Y Z$ is tangent to two fixed circles.

<img_3955>

Since $\eta$ and $\zeta$ are the reflections of the circumcircle $\ell$ of the triangle $G Y Z$ in its sidelines $G Y$ and $G Z$, respectively, they pass through the orthocentre of this triangle. And since $\eta$ and $\zeta$ cross again at $X$, the latter is the orthocentre of the triangle $G Y Z$. Hence the circle $\xi$ through $X, Y, Z$ is the reflection of $\ell$ in the line $Y Z$; in particular, $\xi$ is also of unit diameter.

Let $O$ and $L$ be the centres of $\Omega$ and $\ell$, respectively, and let $R$ be the (variable) centre of $\xi$. Let $G X \operatorname{cross} \xi$ again at $X^{\prime}$; then $G$ and $X^{\prime}$ are reflections of one another in the line $Y Z$, so $G L R X^{\prime}$ is an isosceles trapezoid. Then $L R \| G X$ and $\angle(L G, G X)=\angle\left(G X^{\prime}, X^{\prime} R\right)=\angle(R X, X G)$, i.e., $L G \| R X$; this means that $G L R X$ is a parallelogram, so $\overrightarrow{X R}=\overrightarrow{G L}$ is constant.

Finally, consider the fixed point $N$ defined by $\overrightarrow{O N}=\overrightarrow{G L}$. Then $X R N O$ is a parallelogram, so the distance $R N=O X$ is constant. Consequently, $\xi$ is tangent to the fixed circles centred at $N$ of radii $|1 / 2-O X|$ and $1 / 2+O X$.

One last check is needed to show that the inverse images of the two obtained circles are indeed circles and not lines. This might happen if one of them contained $G$; we show that this is impossible. Indeed, since $\Omega$ lies inside $\ell$, we have $O L<1 / 2-O X$, so

$$
N G=|\overrightarrow{G L}+\overrightarrow{L O}+\overrightarrow{O N}|=|2 \overrightarrow{G L}+\overrightarrow{L O}| \geq 2|\overrightarrow{G L}|-|\overrightarrow{L O}|>1-(1 / 2-O X)=1 / 2+O X
$$

this shows that $G$ is necessarily outside the obtained circles.",0,False,442

Let $A B C$ be a triangle and let $D$ be a point on the segment $B C, D \neq B$ and $D \neq C$. The circle $A B D$ meets the segment $A C$ again at an interior point $E$. The circle $A C D$ meets the segment $A B$ again at an interior point $F$. Let $A^{\prime}$ be the reflection of $A$ in the line $B C$. The lines $A^{\prime} C$ and $D E$ meet at $P$, and the lines $A^{\prime} B$ and $D F$ meet at $Q$. Prove that the lines $A D, B P$ and $C Q$ are concurrent (or all parallel).
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric properties and relationships in the given problem. We need to prove that the lines $AD$, $BP$, and $CQ$ are concurrent or parallel. We start by examining the points and lines involved and their intersections.

1. **Reflection and Intersection Points:**
   - $A'$ is the reflection of $A$ in the line $BC$. This means that $A'$ is on the opposite side of $BC$ from $A$ and $A'$ is the same distance from $BC$ as $A$.
   - $P$ is the intersection of $A' C$ and $DE$.
   - $Q$ is the intersection of $A' B$ and $DF$.

2. **Cyclic Quadrilaterals:**
   - Since $ABD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, $\angle ABD = \angle ACD$.
   - Since $ACD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, $\angle ACD = \angle ABD$.
   - This implies that $\angle ABD = \angle ACD$.

3. **Parallel Lines:**
   - We need to show that $AD$, $BP$, and $CQ$ are concurrent or parallel. Let's consider the possibility that $AD$ is parallel to $BP$ and $CQ$.
   - If $AD$ is parallel to $BP$ and $CQ$, then the angles formed by these lines and the sides of the triangle will be equal, which would imply that the lines are concurrent or parallel.

4. **Using the Reflection Property:**
   - Since $A'$ is the reflection of $A$ in $BC$, the line $A' C$ is the reflection of $AC$ in $BC$. This means that $A' C$ is parallel to $AC$.
   - Similarly, $A' B$ is parallel to $AB$.
   - This parallelism and the cyclic properties of the quadrilaterals suggest that the lines $AD$, $BP$, and $CQ$ are indeed concurrent or parallel.

</think>
<answer> The lines $AD$, $BP$, and $CQ$ are concurrent or parallel. </answer>","Let $\sigma$ denote reflection in the line $B C$. Since $\angle B D F=\angle B A C=$ $\angle C D E$, by concyclicity, the lines $D E$ and $D F$ are images of one another under $\sigma$, so the lines $A C$ and $D F$ meet at $P^{\prime}=\sigma(P)$, and the lines $A B$ and $D E$ meet at $Q^{\prime}=\sigma(Q)$. Consequently, the lines $P Q$ and $P^{\prime} Q^{\prime}=\sigma(P Q)$ meet at some (possibly ideal) point $R$ on the line $B C$.



Since the pairs of lines $(C A, Q D),(A B, D P),(B C, P Q)$ meet at three collinear points, namely $P^{\prime}, Q^{\prime}, R$ respectively, the triangles $A B C$ and $D P Q$ are perspective, i.e., the lines $A D, B P, C Q$ are concurrent, by the Desargues theorem.

Amy and Bob play the game. At the beginning, Amy writes down a positive integer on the board. Then the players take moves in turn, Bob moves first. On any move of his, Bob replaces the number $n$ on the blackboard with a number of the form $n-a^{2}$, where $a$ is a positive integer. On any move of hers, Amy replaces the number $n$ on the blackboard with a number of the form $n^{k}$, where $k$ is a positive integer. Bob wins if the number on the board becomes zero. Can Amy prevent Bob's win?
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the possible moves that Bob can make. Bob can subtract a perfect square from the number on the board. If the number on the board is $n$, Bob can write $n - a^2$ where $a$ is a positive integer. 

Next, let's consider the possible moves that Amy can make. Amy can raise the number on the board to any positive integer power. If the number on the board is $n$, Amy can write $n^k$ where $k$ is a positive integer.

The goal is to determine if Amy can prevent Bob from making the number on the board zero. 

Let's start by considering the initial number on the board, $n$. If $n$ is a perfect square, Bob can immediately subtract it from $n$ to get zero. So, if $n = a^2$, Bob wins. 

If $n$ is not a perfect square, we need to consider the possibility of Amy's moves. If Amy raises $n$ to a power, she can potentially create a new number that is not a perfect square, and Bob can then subtract a perfect square from it. 

However, if $n$ is a prime number, then $n^k$ (for any positive integer $k$) will also be a prime number, and Bob cannot subtract a perfect square from it to get zero. 

So, if Amy starts with a prime number, she can prevent Bob from winning by keeping the number as a prime. </think>
<answer> If Amy starts with a prime number, she can prevent Bob from winning by keeping the number as a prime. </answer>","The answer is in the negative. For a positive integer $n$, we define its square-free part $S(n)$ to be the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $n / a$ is a square of an integer. In other words, $S(n)$ is the product of all primes having odd exponents in the prime expansion of $n$. We also agree that $S(0)=0$.



Now we show that (i) on any move of hers, Amy does not increase the square-free part of the positive integer on the board; and (ii) on any move of his, Bob always can replace a positive integer $n$ with a non-negative integer $k$ with $S(k)<S(n)$. Thus, if the game starts by a positive integer $N$, Bob can win in at most $S(N)$ moves.



Part (i) is trivial, as the definition of the square-part yields $S\left(n^{k}\right)=S(n)$ whenever $k$ is odd, and $S\left(n^{k}\right)=1 \leq S(n)$ whenever $k$ is even, for any positive integer $n$.



Part (ii) is also easy: if, before Bob's move, the board contains a number $n=S(n) \cdot b^{2}$, then Bob may replace it with $n^{\prime}=n-b^{2}=(S(n)-1) b^{2}$, whence $S\left(n^{\prime}\right) \leq S(n)-1$.",0,False,340

Let $A B C D$ be an isosceles trapezoid with $A B \| C D$. Let $E$ be the midpoint of $A C$. Denote by $\omega$ and $\Omega$ the circumcircles of the triangles $A B E$ and $C D E$, respectively. Let $P$ be the crossing poitn of the tangent to $\omega$ at $A$ with the tangent to $\Omega$ at $D$. Prove that $P E$ is tangent to $\Omega$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the isosceles trapezoid and the circumcircles. Since $A B \| C D$ and $A B = C D$, the trapezoid is symmetric with respect to the line $E$ (the midpoint of $A C$). This symmetry implies that the angles $\angle A E B$ and $\angle D E C$ are equal, and the tangents to the circumcircles at points $A$ and $D$ will be symmetric with respect to the line $E$.

Now, let's consider the tangents to the circumcircles at points $A$ and $D$. The tangent to $\omega$ at $A$ and the tangent to $\Omega$ at $D$ will intersect at point $P$. We need to show that $P E$ is tangent to $\Omega$.

Since $E$ is the midpoint of $A C$, it lies on the perpendicular bisector of $A C$. The tangents at $A$ and $D$ are perpendicular to the radii at these points, and by the symmetry of the trapezoid, the tangents at $A$ and $D$ are symmetric with respect to the line $E$. This symmetry implies that the line $P E$ will be tangent to $\Omega$ at some point, because the tangents at $A$ and $D$ are symmetric and the point $P$ is the intersection of these tangents.

</think>
<answer> $P E$ is tangent to $\Omega$ </answer>","If $A B C D$ is a rectangle, the statement is trivial due to symmetry. Hence, in what follows we assume $A D \nparallel B C$.



Let $F$ be the midpoint of $B D$; by symmetry, both $\omega$ and $\Omega$ pass through $F$. Let $P^{\prime}$ be the meeting point of tangents to $\omega$ at $F$ and to $\Omega$ at $E$. We aim to show that $P^{\prime}=P$, which yields the required result. For that purpose, we show that $P^{\prime} A$ and $P^{\prime} D$ are tangent to $\omega$ and $\Omega$, respectively.



Let $K$ be the midpoint of $A F$. Then $E K$ is a midline in the triangle $A C F$, so $\angle(A E, E K)=$ $\angle(E C, C F)$. Since $P^{\prime} E$ is tangent to $\Omega$, we get $\angle(E C, C F)=\angle\left(P^{\prime} E, E F\right)$. Thus, $\angle(A E, E K)=$ $\angle\left(P^{\prime} E, E F\right)$, so $E P^{\prime}$ is a symmedian in the triangle $A E F$. Therefore, $E P^{\prime}$ and the tangents to $\omega$ at $A$ and $F$ are concurrent, and the concurrency point is $P^{\prime}$ itself. Hence $P^{\prime} A$ is tangent to $\omega$.



The second claim is similar. Taking $L$ to be the midpoint of $D E$, we have $\angle(D F, F L)=$ $\angle(F B, B E)=\angle\left(P^{\prime} F, F E\right)$, so $P^{\prime} F$ is a symmedian in the triangle $D E F$, and hence $P^{\prime}$ is the meeting point of the tangents to $\Omega$ at $D$ and $E$.

Given any positive real number $\varepsilon$, prove that, for all but finitely many positive integers $v$, any graph on $v$ vertices with at least $(1+\varepsilon) v$ edges has two distinct simple cycles of equal lengths.



(Recall that the notion of a simple cycle does not allow repetition of vertices in a cycle.)
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the graph. We need to show that for any positive integer $v$ and for all but finitely many $v$, if the graph has at least $(1+\varepsilon) v$ edges, it contains two distinct simple cycles of equal lengths. 

A simple cycle in a graph is a cycle that does not repeat any vertices. We can start by considering the number of edges in the graph. If the graph has $(1+\varepsilon) v$ edges, it means it has more edges than a complete graph on $v$ vertices, which has $\frac{v(v-1)}{2}$ edges. 

Now, let's think about the possible cycle lengths. The smallest cycle in a graph is a triangle (3-cycle), and the largest cycle would be the graph itself if it were a cycle. However, since we are looking for cycles of equal lengths, we should consider the possibility of cycles of length 3, 4, 5, ... up to $v$.

If we have a graph with $(1+\varepsilon) v$ edges, it means that the graph is quite dense. In a dense graph, it is likely to have many cycles. We need to show that among these cycles, there are at least two of the same length. 

To do this, we can use the pigeonhole principle. If we consider the possible cycle lengths from 3 to $v$, there are $v-2$ possible cycle lengths. If we have $(1+\varepsilon) v$ edges, and the graph is dense enough, it is likely that we can find two cycles of the same length. </think>
<answer> For any positive integer $v$ and for all but finitely many $v$, if the graph has at least $(1+\varepsilon) v$ edges, it contains two distinct simple cycles of equal lengths. </answer>","Fix a positive real number $\varepsilon$, and let $G$ be a graph on $v$ vertices with at least $(1+\varepsilon) v$ edges, all of whose simple cycles have pairwise distinct lengths.



Assuming $\varepsilon^{2} v \geq 1$, we exhibit an upper bound linear in $v$ and a lower bound quadratic in $v$ for the total number of simple cycles in $G$, showing thereby that $v$ cannot be arbitrarily large, whence the conclusion.



Since a simple cycle in $G$ has at most $v$ vertices, and each length class contains at most one such, $G$ has at most $v$ pairwise distinct simple cycles. This establishes the desired upper bound.



For the lower bound, consider a spanning tree for each component of $G$, and collect them all together to form a spanning forest $F$. Let $A$ be the set of edges of $F$, and let $B$ be the set of all other edges of $G$. Clearly, $|A| \leq v-1$, so $|B| \geq(1+\varepsilon) v-|A| \geq(1+\varepsilon) v-(v-1)=\varepsilon v+1>\varepsilon v$.



For each edge $b$ in $B$, adjoining $b$ to $F$ produces a unique simple cycle $C_{b}$ through $b$. Let $S_{b}$ be the set of edges in $A$ along $C_{b}$. Since the $C_{b}$ have pairwise distinct lengths, $\sum_{b \in B}\left|S_{b}\right| \geq$ $2+\cdots+(|B|+1)=|B|(|B|+3) / 2>|B|^{2} / 2>\varepsilon^{2} v^{2} / 2$.



Consequently, some edge in $A$ lies in more than $\varepsilon^{2} v^{2} /(2 v)=\varepsilon^{2} v / 2$ of the $S_{b}$. Fix such an edge $a$ in $A$, and let $B^{\prime}$ be the set of all edges $b$ in $B$ whose corresponding $S_{b}$ contain $a$, so $\left|B^{\prime}\right|>\varepsilon^{2} v / 2$.



For each 2-edge subset $\left\{b_{1}, b_{2}\right\}$ of $B^{\prime}$, the union $C_{b_{1}} \cup C_{b_{2}}$ of the cycles $C_{b_{1}}$ and $C_{b_{2}}$ forms a $\theta$-graph, since their common part is a path in $F$ through $a$; and since neither of the $b_{i}$ lies along this path, $C_{b_{1}} \cup C_{b_{2}}$ contains a third simple cycle $C_{b_{1}, b_{2}}$ through both $b_{1}$ and $b_{2}$. Finally, since $B^{\prime} \cap C_{b_{1}, b_{2}}=\left\{b_{1}, b_{2}\right\}$, the assignment $\left\{b_{1}, b_{2}\right\} \mapsto C_{b_{1}, b_{2}}$ is injective, so the total number of simple cycles in $G$ is at least $\left(\begin{array}{c}\left|B^{\prime}\right| \\ 2\end{array}\right)>\left(\begin{array}{c}\varepsilon^{2} v / 2 \\ 2\end{array}\right)$. This establishes the desired lower bound and concludes the proof.",0,False,399

","To solve this, we need to find two functions \( f \) and \( g \) such that the composition \( f \circ g \) is strictly decreasing and the composition \( g \circ f \) is strictly increasing. Let's start by considering the properties of the functions and their compositions. 

First, let's think about the behavior of the functions. If we want \( f \circ g \) to be strictly decreasing, then as \( x \) increases, \( g(x) \) should decrease, and as \( g(x) \) decreases, \( f(g(x)) \) should increase. Similarly, for \( g \circ f \) to be strictly increasing, as \( x \) increases, \( f(x) \) should increase, and as \( f(x) \) increases, \( g(f(x)) \) should increase. 

A good candidate for \( f \) could be a function that is strictly increasing, and for \( g \), a function that is strictly decreasing. Let's consider the functions \( f(x) = x \) and \( g(x) = -x \). </think>

Let $A B C D$ be a cyclic quadrangle and let $P$ be a point on the side $A B$. The diagonal $A C$ crosses the segment $D P$ at $Q$. The parallel through $P$ to $C D$ crosses the extension of the side $B C$ beyond $B$ at $K$, and the parallel through $Q$ to $B D$ crosses the extension of the side $B C$ beyond $B$ at $L$. Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles $B K P$ and $C L Q$ are tangent.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships. We have a cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$ and a point $P$ on $AB$. The diagonal $AC$ intersects $DP$ at $Q$. The parallel through $P$ to $CD$ intersects the extension of $BC$ beyond $B$ at $K$, and the parallel through $Q$ to $BD$ intersects the extension of $BC$ beyond $B$ at $L$. We need to prove that the circumcircles of triangles $BKP$ and $CLQ$ are tangent.

Since $P$ is on $AB$ and $CD \parallel PK$, we can infer that $P$ and $K$ are collinear with $CD$. Similarly, since $Q$ is on $DP$ and $BD \parallel QL$, we can infer that $Q$ and $L$ are collinear with $BD$. 

Now, consider the angles formed by these parallel lines and the intersections. Since $ABCD$ is cyclic, the angles subtended by the same arc are equal. Also, the parallel lines create corresponding angles that are equal. 

Let's look at the angles in triangles $BKP$ and $CLQ$:
- In triangle $BKP$, $\angle BKP = \angle BCD$ because $CD \parallel PK$.
- In triangle $CLQ$, $\angle CLQ = \angle BCD$ because $CD \parallel PK$ and $Q$ is on $DP$.

Since $\angle BKP = \angle CLQ$, and both triangles share the side $BC$, the circumcircles of triangles $BKP$ and $CLQ$ must be tangent at the point where they intersect the extension of $BC$ beyond $B$.

</think>
<answer> The circumcircles of triangles $BKP$ and $CLQ$ are tangent. </answer>","We show that the circles $B K P$ and $C L Q$ are tangent at the point $T$ where the line $D P$ crosses the circle $A B C D$ again.

Since $B C D T$ is cyclic, we have $\angle K B T=\angle C D T$. Since $K P \| C D$, we get $\angle C D T=\angle K P T$. Thus, $\angle K B T=\angle C D T=\angle K P T$, which shows that $T$ lies on the circle $B K P$. Similarly, the equalities $\angle L C T=\angle B D T=\angle L Q T$ show that $T$ also lies on the circle $C L Q$.

It remains to prove that these circles are indeed tangent at $T$. This follows from the fact that the chords $T P$ and $T Q$ in the circles $B K T P$ and $C L T Q$, respectively, both lie along the same line and subtend equal angles $\angle T B P=\angle T B A=\angle T C A=\angle T C Q$.

Determine whether there exist non-constant polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ with real coefficients satisfying
$$
P(x)^{10}+P(x)^{9}=Q(x)^{21}+Q(x)^{20}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given equation:
$$P(x)^{10} + P(x)^9 = Q(x)^{21} + Q(x)^{20}.$$
We need to find if there exist non-constant polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ that satisfy this equation. Let's start by examining the degrees of the polynomials involved. The left side of the equation is a sum of two terms, each of which is a polynomial of degree 10 and 9, respectively. The right side is a sum of two terms, each of which is a polynomial of degree 21 and 20, respectively. This suggests that the degrees of $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ might be 10 and 21, respectively, or vice versa. </think>
<answer> (x^{10} + x^9) = (x^{21} + x^{20}) </answer>","The answer is in the negative. Comparing the degrees of both sides in $(1)$ we get $\operatorname{deg} P=21 n$ and $\operatorname{deg} Q=10 n$ for some positive integer $n$. Take the derivative of $(1)$ to obtain

$$
P^{\prime} P^{8}(10 P+9)=Q^{\prime} Q^{19}(21 Q+20)
$$

Since $\operatorname{gcd}(10 P+9, P)=\operatorname{gcd}(10 P+9, P+1)=1$, it follows that $\operatorname{gcd}\left(10 P+9, P^{9}(P+1)\right)=1$, so $\operatorname{gcd}(10 P+9, Q)=1$, by $(1)$. Thus $(2)$ yields $10 P+9 \mid Q^{\prime}(21 Q+20)$, which is impossible since $0<\operatorname{deg}\left(Q^{\prime}(21 Q+20)\right)=20 n-1<21 n=\operatorname{deg}(10 P+9)$.

Ann and Bob play a game on an infinite checkered plane making moves in turn; Ann makes the first move. A move consists in orienting any unit grid-segment that has not been oriented before. If at some stage some oriented segments form an oriented cycle, Bob wins. Does Bob have a strategy that guarantees him to win?
Assistant: <think>
","To determine if Bob has a strategy that guarantees him to win, let's analyze the game step by step. The game is played on an infinite checkered plane, and the objective is to form an oriented cycle using unit grid segments. Ann makes the first move, and Bob makes the second move, and they alternate turns. The game ends when Bob can form an oriented cycle, and Bob wins. 

First, let's consider the nature of the game. If Bob can form a cycle, it means he can create a closed loop using the segments he has oriented. However, if Ann can prevent Bob from forming a cycle, Bob will not win. 

One way to approach this is to consider the possibility of creating a cycle by using segments that are already oriented. If Bob can use segments that are already oriented in a way that forms a cycle, he wins. However, if Ann can always prevent Bob from forming a cycle by orienting segments in a way that does not allow a cycle to be formed, Bob will not win.

A key observation is that if Bob can form a cycle, it must involve segments that are already oriented. If Ann can always prevent Bob from forming a cycle by orienting segments in a way that does not allow a cycle to be formed, Bob will not win. 

</think>
<answer> No, Bob does not have a strategy that guarantees him to win. </answer>","The answer is in the negative: Ann has a strategy allowing her to prevent Bob's victory.

We say that two unit grid-segments form a low-left corner (or LL-corner) if they share an endpoint which is the lowest point of one and the leftmost point of the other. An up-right corner (or UR-corner) is defined similarly. The common endpoint of two unit grid-segments at a corner is the joint of that corner.

Fix a vertical line on the grid and call it the midline; the unit grid-segments along the midline are called middle segments. The unit grid-segments lying to the left/right of the midline are called left/right segments. Partition all left segments into LL-corners, and all right segments into UR-corners.

We now describe Ann's strategy. Her first move consists in orienting some middle segment arbitrarily. Assume that at some stage, Bob orients some segment $s$. If $s$ is a middle segment, Ann orients any free middle segment arbitrarily. Otherwise, $s$ forms a corner in the partition with some other segment $t$. Then Ann orients $t$ so that the joint of the corner is either the source of both arrows, or the target of both. Notice that after any move of Ann's, each corner in the partition is either completely oriented or completely not oriented. This means that Ann can always make a required move.

Assume that Bob wins at some stage, i.e., an oriented cycle $C$ occurs. Let $X$ be the lowest of the leftmost points of $C$, and let $Y$ be the topmost of the rightmost points of $C$. If $X$ lies (strictly) to the left of the midline, then $X$ is the joint of some corner whose segments are both oriented. But, according to Ann's strategy, they are oriented so that they cannot occur in a cycle - a contradiction. Otherwise, $Y$ lies to the right of the midline, and a similar argument applies. Thus, Bob will never win, as desired.

Given a sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ of real numbers. For each $i(1 \leq i \leq n)$ define

","First, let's consider the sequence of real numbers $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \ldots \leq x_n$. We need to show that the maximum of the absolute differences between the $x_i$ and the $a_i$ is at least $\frac{d}{2}$. 

Given the definition of $d_i$ and $d$, we know that $d_i$ is the difference between the maximum value of the sequence up to $i$ and the minimum value of the sequence from $i$ to $n$. 

Let's analyze the expression for $d_i$:
- $d_i = \max \{a_j : 1 \leq j \leq i\} - \min \{a_j : i \leq j \leq n\}$
- This means that $d_i$ is the gap between the highest value in the first $i$ terms and the lowest value in the remaining terms.

Now, consider the expression for $d$:
- $d = \max \{d_i : 1 \leq i \leq n\}$
- This means that $d$ is the largest gap between the highest value in the first $i$ terms and the lowest value in the remaining terms for any $i$ from 1 to $n$.

To prove the inequality, we need to show that for any $i$, the maximum of the absolute differences between the $x_i$ and the $a_i$ is at least $\frac{d}{2}$. 

Let's consider the case when $i = 1$. Here, $d_1 = \max \{a_1\} - \min \{a_j : j \geq 2\}$. The maximum absolute difference between $x_1$ and $a_1$ is $\max \{|x_1 - a_1|\}$. Since $d_1$ is the gap between the first term and the rest, we have:
- $|x_1 - a_1| \geq \frac{d_1}{2} = \frac{\max \{a_1\} - \min \{a_j : j \geq 2\}}{2}$
- This holds because the gap between the first term and the rest is at least half of the maximum gap $d$.

For the general case, when $i$ is any integer from 1 to $n$, the same reasoning applies. The maximum absolute difference between $x_i$ and $a_i$ is at least $\frac{d_i}{2} \geq \frac{d}{2}$, since $d_i \leq d$ for all $i$.

</think>
<answer> \max \left\{\left|x_{i} - a_{i}\right|: 1 \leq i \leq n\right\} \geq \frac{d}{2} </answer>","Let $1 \leq p \leq q \leq r \leq n$ be indices for which

$$
d=d_{q}, \quad a_{p}=\max \left\{a_{j}: 1 \leq j \leq q\right\}, \quad a_{r}=\min \left\{a_{j}: q \leq j \leq n\right\}
$$

and thus $d=a_{p}-a_{r}$. (These indices are not necessarily unique.)

<img_3891>

For arbitrary real numbers $x_{1} \leq x_{2} \leq \ldots \leq x_{n}$, consider just the two quantities $\left|x_{p}-a_{p}\right|$ and $\left|x_{r}-a_{r}\right|$. Since

$$
\left(a_{p}-x_{p}\right)+\left(x_{r}-a_{r}\right)=\left(a_{p}-a_{r}\right)+\left(x_{r}-x_{p}\right) \geq a_{p}-a_{r}=d

","First, let's consider the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and the definition of $d_i$. The expression $d_i$ is the difference between the maximum value of the sequence up to $a_i$ and the minimum value of the sequence from $a_i$ to $a_n$. The goal is to find a sequence $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \ldots \leq x_n$ such that $d = \max \{d_i\}$, which means that the maximum difference between the maximum up to $a_i$ and the minimum from $a_i$ to $a_n$ is achieved by this sequence.

To achieve this, we can consider the following approach: if we can find a sequence where the maximum difference between the maximum up to $a_i$ and the minimum from $a_i$ to $a_n$ is exactly $d$, then we have our desired sequence. 

One way to approach this is to consider the sequence where $x_i$ is the value that maximizes the difference $d_i$. This means that for each $i$, $x_i$ should be chosen such that the difference between the maximum of the first $i$ terms and the minimum of the remaining terms is $d_i$. 

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose we have the sequence $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 3, a_4 = 4$. We need to find a sequence $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq x_3 \leq x_4$ such that the maximum difference between the maximum up to $x_i$ and the minimum from $x_i$ to $x_4$ is 3. 

- For $i = 1$, $d_1 = \max\{1\} - \min\{4\} = 1 - 4 = -3$ (not useful, as we need to maximize the difference).
- For $i = 2$, $d_2 = \max\{1, 2\} - \min\{3, 4\} = 2 - 3 = -1$ (not useful, as we need to maximize the difference).
- For $i = 3$, $d_3 = \max\{1, 2, 3\} - \min\{4\} = 3 - 4 = -1$ (not useful, as we need to maximize the difference).
- For $i = 4$, $d_4 = \max\{1, 2, 3, 4\} - \min\{1, 2, 3\} = 4 - 2 = 2$ (not useful, as we need to maximize the difference).

$$
x_{1}=a_{1}-\frac{d}{2}, \quad x_{k}=\max \left\{x_{k-1}, a_{k}-\frac{d}{2}\right\} \quad \text { for } 2 \leq k \leq n
$$

We show that we have equality in (1) for this sequence.

By the definition, sequence $\left(x_{k}\right)$ is non-decreasing and $x_{k}-a_{k} \geq-\frac{d}{2}$ for all $1 \leq k \leq n$. Next we prove that

$$
x_{k}-a_{k} \leq \frac{d}{2} \quad \text { for all } 1 \leq k \leq n\tag{2}
$$

Consider an arbitrary index $1 \leq k \leq n$. Let $\ell \leq k$ be the smallest index such that $x_{k}=x_{\ell}$. We have either $\ell=1$, or $\ell \geq 2$ and $x_{\ell}>x_{\ell-1}$. In both cases,

$$
x_{k}=x_{\ell}=a_{\ell}-\frac{d}{2}\tag{3}

Since

$$
a_{\ell}-a_{k} \leq \max \left\{a_{j}: 1 \leq j \leq k\right\}-\min \left\{a_{j}: k \leq j \leq n\right\}=d_{k} \leq d

$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given equation \(x^n + y^n = 1\). We need to prove that the product of two sums is less than \(\frac{1}{(1-x)(1-y)}\). Let's start by examining the sums in the expression:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1+x^{2k}}{1+x^{4k}} \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1+y^{2k}}{1+y^{4k}}
\]
We need to show that the product of these two sums is less than \(\frac{1}{(1-x)(1-y)}\).

Let's first consider the term \(\frac{1+x^{2k}}{1+x^{4k}}\). We can rewrite it as:
\[
\frac{1+x^{2k}}{1+x^{4k}} = \frac{1+x^{2k}}{1+x^{4k}} = \frac{1+x^{2k}}{1+x^{4k}} = \frac{1+x^{2k}}{1+x^{4k}}
\]
This expression is always positive and less than 1 for \(x, y > 0\). Similarly, \(\frac{1+y^{2k}}{1+y^{4k}}\) is also positive and less than 1 for \(y > 0\).

Now, let's consider the product of these two sums:
\[
\left( \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1+x^{2k}}{1+x^{4k}} \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1+y^{2k}}{1+y^{4k}} \right)
\]
To prove that this product is less than \(\frac{1}{(1-x)(1-y)}\), we need to consider the behavior of the sums and the fractions involved. 

Given that \(x^n + y^n = 1\), we can use the fact that for \(x, y > 0\), the expression \(\frac{1+x^{2k}}{1+x^{4k}}\) and \(\frac{1+y^{2k}}{1+y^{4k}}\) are bounded and their product will be less than 1 when multiplied together. 

To see this more clearly, let's consider the extreme case where \(x = y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\). In this case, the sums will be:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1+\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)^{2k}}{1+\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)^{4k}} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1+\frac{1}{n^k}}{1+\frac{1}{n^{2k}}}
\]
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1+\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)^{2k}}{1+\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)^{4k}} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1+\frac{1}{n^k}}{1+\frac{1}{n^{2k}}}
\]
Multiplying these sums together, we get a product that is less than \(\frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})} = \frac{1}{(1-x)(1-y)}\).

$$
\frac{1+t^{2}}{1+t^{4}}=\frac{1}{t}-\frac{(1-t)\left(1-t^{3}\right)}{t\left(1+t^{4}\right)}<\frac{1}{t}
$$

Substituting $t=x^{k}$ and $t=y^{k}$,

$$
0<\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1+x^{2 k}}{1+x^{4 k}}<\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{x^{k}}=\frac{1-x^{n}}{x^{n}(1-x)} \quad \text { and } \quad 0<\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1+y^{2 k}}{1+y^{4 k}}<\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{y^{k}}=\frac{1-y^{n}}{y^{n}(1-y)}
$$

Since $1-y^{n}=x^{n}$ and $1-x^{n}=y^{n}$,

$$
\frac{1-x^{n}}{x^{n}(1-x)}=\frac{y^{n}}{x^{n}(1-x)}, \quad \frac{1-y^{n}}{y^{n}(1-y)}=\frac{x^{n}}{y^{n}(1-y)}

Let $c>2$, and let $a(1), a(2), \ldots$ be a sequence of nonnegative real numbers such that

$$
a(m+n) \leq 2 a(m)+2 a(n) \text { for all } m, n \geq 1\tag{1}
$$

and

$$
a\left(2^{k}\right) \leq \frac{1}{(k+1)^{c}} \quad \text { for all } k \geq 0\tag{2}
$$

Prove that the sequence $a(n)$ is bounded.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions. We have a sequence \(a(n)\) that satisfies the inequality \(a(m+n) \leq 2a(m) + 2a(n)\) for all \(m, n \geq 1\). This inequality suggests that the sequence grows at most exponentially. Additionally, we have the condition that \(a(2^k) \leq \frac{1}{(k+1)^c}\) for all \(k \geq 0\). This condition provides a bound on the values of the sequence at powers of 2, which can help us understand the behavior of the sequence in general.

To prove that the sequence \(a(n)\) is bounded, we need to show that there exists a constant \(M\) such that \(a(n) \leq M\) for all \(n \geq 1\).

Let's start by considering the values of the sequence at powers of 2. From the given condition, we know that \(a(2^k) \leq \frac{1}{(k+1)^c}\). This gives us a bound on the values of the sequence at these points. However, we need to extend this bound to all \(n\). 

To do this, we can use the inequality \(a(m+n) \leq 2a(m) + 2a(n)\). If we can show that the sequence is bounded by a constant when \(m\) and \(n\) are close to each other, then we can use this to extend the bound to all \(n\).

Let's consider the case when \(m = n\). Then we have \(a(2m) \leq 2a(m) + 2a(m) = 4a(m)\). This suggests that the sequence grows at most quadratically. However, we need to be more precise. 

Given the condition \(a(2^k) \leq \frac{1}{(k+1)^c}\), we can use this to show that the sequence is bounded. If we can show that the sequence is bounded by a constant when \(m\) and \(n\) are close, then we can use this to extend the bound to all \(n\).

</think>
<answer> a(n) \leq \frac{1}{(c-1)^c} \text{ for all } n \geq 1 </answer>","For convenience, define $a(0)=0$; then condition (1) persists for all pairs of nonnegative indices.

Lemma 1. For arbitrary nonnegative indices $n_{1}, \ldots, n_{k}$, we have

$$
a\left(\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_{i}\right) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i} a\left(n_{i}\right)\tag{3}
$$

and

$$
a\left(\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_{i}\right) \leq 2 k \sum_{i=1}^{k} a\left(n_{i}\right)\tag{4}
$$

Proof. Inequality (3) is proved by induction on $k$. The base case $k=1$ is trivial, while the induction step is provided by

$$
a\left(\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} n_{i}\right)=a\left(n_{1}+\sum_{i=2}^{k+1} n_{i}\right) \leq 2 a\left(n_{1}\right)+2 a\left(\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_{i+1}\right) \leq 2 a\left(n_{1}\right)+2 \sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i} a\left(n_{i+1}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} 2^{i} a\left(n_{i}\right)
$$

To establish (4), first the inequality
$$
a\left(\sum_{i=1}^{2^{d}} n_{i}\right) \leq 2^{d} \sum_{i=1}^{2^{d}} a\left(n_{i}\right)
$$
can be proved by an obvious induction on $d$. Then, turning to (4), we find an integer $d$ such that $2^{d-1}<k \leq 2^{d}$ to obtain
$$
a\left(\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_{i}\right)=a\left(\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_{i}+\sum_{i=k+1}^{2^{d}} 0\right) \leq 2^{d}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{k} a\left(n_{i}\right)+\sum_{i=k+1}^{2^{d}} a(0)\right)=2^{d} \sum_{i=1}^{k} a\left(n_{i}\right) \leq 2 k \sum_{i=1}^{k} a\left(n_{i}\right) .
$$
Fix an increasing unbounded sequence $0=M_{0}<M_{1}<M_{2}<\ldots$ of real numbers; the exact values will be defined later. Let $n$ be an arbitrary positive integer and write
$$
n=\sum_{i=0}^{d} \varepsilon_{i} \cdot 2^{i}, \quad \text { where } \varepsilon_{i} \in\{0,1\}
$$
Set $\varepsilon_{i}=0$ for $i>d$, and take some positive integer $f$ such that $M_{f}>d$. Applying (3), we get
$$
a(n)=a\left(\sum_{k=1}^{f} \sum_{M_{k-1} \leq i<M_{k}} \varepsilon_{i} \cdot 2^{i}\right) \leq \sum_{k=1}^{f} 2^{k} a\left(\sum_{M_{k-1} \leq i<M_{k}} \varepsilon_{i} \cdot 2^{i}\right)
$$


Note that there are less than $M_{k}-M_{k-1}+1$ integers in interval $\left[M_{k-1}, M_{k}\right)$; hence, using (4) we have
$$

Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{100}$ be nonnegative real numbers such that $a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\ldots+a_{100}^{2}=1$. Prove that
$$
a_{1}^{2} a_{2}+a_{2}^{2} a_{3}+\ldots+a_{100}^{2} a_{1}<\frac{12}{25}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: $a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\ldots+a_{100}^{2}=1$. We need to prove that $a_{1}^{2} a_{2}+a_{2}^{2} a_{3}+\ldots+a_{100}^{2} a_{1}<\frac{12}{25}$. 

One approach is to use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in a clever way. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ and $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, we have:
\[
(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_n^2)(y_1^2 + y_2^2 + \ldots + y_n^2) \geq (x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + \ldots + x_n y_n)^2
\]
In our case, let's set $x_i = a_i$ and $y_i = a_{i+1}$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, 99$ (with $a_{100} = a_1$). Then, the inequality becomes:
\[
(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_{100}^2)(a_2^2 + a_3^2 + \ldots + a_{100}^2) \geq (a_1 a_2 + a_2 a_3 + \ldots + a_{100} a_1)^2
\]
Since $a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_{100}^2 = 1$, we have:
\[
1 \cdot (a_2^2 + a_3^2 + \ldots + a_{100}^2) \geq (a_1 a_2 + a_2 a_3 + \ldots + a_{100} a_1)^2
\]
\[
a_2^2 + a_3^2 + \ldots + a_{100}^2 \geq (a_1 a_2 + a_2 a_3 + \ldots + a_{100} a_1)^2
\]
Now, we need to find a way to bound the expression $a_1 a_2 + a_2 a_3 + \ldots + a_{100} a_1$. We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the numbers is 1, and the numbers are nonnegative. If we assume that the numbers are distributed in a way that maximizes the expression, we can use the inequality to our advantage. 

If we consider the case where $a_1 = a_2 = \ldots = a_{100} = \frac{1}{10}$, then:
\[
a_1 a_2 + a_2 a_3 + \ldots + a_{100} a_1 = 10 \left( \frac{1}{10} \cdot \frac{1}{10} \right) = \frac{10}{100} = \frac{1}{10}
\]
\[
\left( a_1 a_2 + a_2 a_3 + \ldots + a_{100} a_1 \right)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{100}
\]
\[
a_2^2 + a_3^2 + \ldots + a_{100}^2 = 10 \left( \frac{1}{10} \right)^2 = \frac{10}{100} = \frac{1}{10}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{10} \geq \frac{1}{100} \implies \left( a_1 a_2 + a_2 a_3 + \ldots + a_{100} a_1 \right)^2 \leq \frac{1}{100}
\]
\[
\left( a_1 a_2 + a_2 a_3 + \ldots + a_{100} a_1 \right)^2 \leq \frac{12}{25} \implies a_1 a_2 + a_2 a_3 + \ldots + a_{100} a_1 < \frac{12}{25}

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to sequences $\left(a_{k+1}\right)$ and $\left(a_{k}^{2}+2 a_{k+1} a_{k+2}\right)$, and then the AM-GM inequality to numbers $a_{k+1}^{2}$ and $a_{k+2}^{2}$,

A unit square is dissected into $n>1$ rectangles such that their sides are parallel to the sides of the square. Any line, parallel to a side of the square and intersecting its interior, also intersects the interior of some rectangle. Prove that in this dissection, there exists a rectangle having no point on the boundary of the square.
Assistant: <think>
","To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the rectangles and the unit square. The key observation is that the line that intersects the interior of the square and the interior of some rectangle must pass through the interior of the rectangle. This means that the rectangle must be entirely within the unit square, and it cannot touch the boundary of the square. 

Let's consider the possibility of having a rectangle that does not touch the boundary of the square. If we can find such a rectangle, we are done. 

First, let's think about the possible configurations of the rectangles. If we have a rectangle that touches the boundary of the square, it must have one side along a side of the square. However, if we have a rectangle that does not touch the boundary, it must be entirely within the unit square. 

Now, let's consider the possibility of having a rectangle that is entirely within the unit square but does not touch the boundary. This would mean that the rectangle is completely contained within the unit square, and its sides are parallel to the sides of the square. 

To prove that such a rectangle exists, we can use a proof by contradiction. Assume that all rectangles in the dissection touch the boundary of the square. This means that each rectangle has at least one side along a side of the square. However, if we consider the unit square, it can be divided into smaller rectangles in various ways, and it is possible to create a configuration where one of these smaller rectangles is entirely within the unit square and does not touch the boundary. 

</think>
<answer> There exists a rectangle in the dissection that does not touch the boundary of the unit square. </answer>","Call the directions of the sides of the square horizontal and vertical. A horizontal or vertical line, which intersects the interior of the square but does not intersect the interior of any rectangle, will be called a splitting line. A rectangle having no point on the boundary of the square will be called an interior rectangle.

Suppose, to the contrary, that there exists a dissection of the square into more than one rectangle, such that no interior rectangle and no splitting line appear. Consider such a dissection with the least possible number of rectangles. Notice that this number of rectangles is greater than 2, otherwise their common side provides a splitting line.

If there exist two rectangles having a common side, then we can replace them by their union (see Figure 1). The number of rectangles was greater than 2, so in a new dissection it is greater than 1. Clearly, in the new dissection, there is also no splitting line as well as no interior rectangle. This contradicts the choice of the original dissection.

Denote the initial square by $A B C D$, with $A$ and $B$ being respectively the lower left and lower right vertices. Consider those two rectangles $a$ and $b$ containing vertices $A$ and $B$, respectively. (Note that $a \neq b$, otherwise its top side provides a splitting line.) We can assume that the height of $a$ is not greater than that of $b$. Then consider the rectangle $c$ neighboring to the lower right corner of $a$ (it may happen that $c=b$ ). By aforementioned, the heights of $a$ and $c$ are distinct. Then two cases are possible.

Figure 1

Figure 2

Figure 3

Case 1. The height of $c$ is less than that of $a$. Consider the rectangle $d$ which is adjacent to both $a$ and $c$, i. e. the one containing the angle marked in Figure 2. This rectangle has no common point with $B C$ (since $a$ is not higher than $b$ ), as well as no common point with $A B$ or with $A D$ (obviously). Then $d$ has a common point with $C D$, and its left side provides a splitting line. Contradiction.

Case 2. The height of $c$ is greater than that of $a$. Analogously, consider the rectangle $d$ containing the angle marked on Figure 3. It has no common point with $A D$ (otherwise it has a common side with $a$ ), as well as no common point with $A B$ or with $B C$ (obviously). Then $d$ has a common point with $C D$. Hence its right side provides a splitting line, and we get the contradiction again.",0,False,342

Let $A_{0}=\left(a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ be a finite sequence of real numbers. For each $k \geq 0$, from the sequence $A_{k}=\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$ we construct a new sequence $A_{k+1}$ in the following way.

1. We choose a partition $\{1, \ldots, n\}=I \cup J$, where $I$ and $J$ are two disjoint sets, such that the expression
$$
\left|\sum_{i \in I} x_{i}-\sum_{j \in J} x_{j}\right|
$$
attains the smallest possible value. (We allow the sets $I$ or $J$ to be empty; in this case the corresponding sum is 0 .) If there are several such partitions, one is chosen arbitrarily.

2. We set $A_{k+1}=\left(y_{1}, \ldots, y_{n}\right)$, where $y_{i}=x_{i}+1$ if $i \in I$, and $y_{i}=x_{i}-1$ if $i \in J$.

Prove that for some $k$, the sequence $A_{k}$ contains an element $x$ such that $|x| \geq n / 2$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the initial sequence $A_0 = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)$. We need to show that there exists a sequence $A_k$ for some $k$ such that $|x| \geq n/2$ for some $x \in A_k$.

The transformation from $A_k$ to $A_{k+1}$ involves partitioning the set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ into two disjoint subsets $I$ and $J$ and then adjusting the elements of the sequence accordingly. The goal is to minimize the expression $|\sum_{i \in I} x_i - \sum_{j \in J} x_j|$. 

Let's analyze the effect of this transformation. If we have a sequence where the sum of the elements in $I$ is significantly larger than the sum of the elements in $J$, then the expression $|\sum_{i \in I} x_i - \sum_{j \in J} x_j|$ will be large. Conversely, if the sums are close, the expression will be small. 

Now, consider the possibility that after a series of transformations, we can end up with a sequence where the sum of the elements in one subset is at least half of the total sum. This would mean that the absolute value of the elements in that subset is at least $n/2$. 

To see why, let's assume that after some transformations, we have a sequence where the sum of the elements in one subset is at least $n/2$. If we denote the sum of the elements in this subset as $S$, then $S \geq n/2$. Since the elements in this subset are either increased or decreased by 1, the absolute value of the elements in this subset must be at least $n/2$. </think>
<answer> |x| \geq n/2 </answer>","Lemma. Suppose that all terms of the sequence $\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$ satisfy the inequality $\left|x_{i}\right|<a$. Then there exists a partition $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}=I \cup J$ into two disjoint sets such that
$$
\left|\sum_{i \in I} x_{i}-\sum_{j \in J} x_{j}\right|<a\tag{1}
$$
Proof. Apply an induction on $n$. The base case $n=1$ is trivial. For the induction step, consider a sequence $\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)(n>1)$. By the induction hypothesis there exists a splitting $\{1, \ldots, n-1\}=I^{\prime} \cup J^{\prime}$ such that
$$
\left|\sum_{i \in I^{\prime}} x_{i}-\sum_{j \in J^{\prime}} x_{j}\right|<a
$$
For convenience, suppose that $\sum_{i \in I^{\prime}} x_{i} \geq \sum_{j \in J^{\prime}} x_{j}$. If $x_{n} \geq 0$ then choose $I=I^{\prime}, J=J \cup\{n\}$; otherwise choose $I=I^{\prime} \cup\{n\}, J=J^{\prime}$. In both cases, we have $\sum_{i \in I^{\prime}} x_{i}-\sum_{j \in J^{\prime}} x_{j} \in[0, a)$ and $\left|x_{n}\right| \in[0, a)$; hence
$$
\sum_{i \in I} x_{i}-\sum_{j \in J} x_{j}=\sum_{i \in I^{\prime}} x_{i}-\sum_{j \in J^{\prime}} x_{j}-\left|x_{n}\right| \in(-a, a)
$$
as desired.

Let us turn now to the problem. To the contrary, assume that for all $k$, all the numbers in $A_{k}$ lie in interval $(-n / 2, n / 2)$. Consider an arbitrary sequence $A_{k}=\left(b_{1}, \ldots, b_{n}\right)$. To obtain the term $b_{i}$, we increased and decreased number $a_{i}$ by one several times. Therefore $b_{i}-a_{i}$ is always an integer, and there are not more than $n$ possible values for $b_{i}$. So, there are not more than $n^{n}$ distinct possible sequences $A_{k}$, and hence two of the sequences $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{n^{n}+1}$ should be identical, say $A_{p}=A_{q}$ for some $p<q$.

For any positive integer $k$, let $S_{k}$ be the sum of squares of elements in $A_{k}$. Consider two consecutive sequences $A_{k}=\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$ and $A_{k+1}=\left(y_{1}, \ldots, y_{n}\right)$. Let $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}=I \cup J$ be the partition used in this step - that is, $y_{i}=x_{i}+1$ for all $i \in I$ and $y_{j}=x_{j}-1$ for all $j \in J$. Since the value of $\left|\sum_{i \in I} x_{i}-\sum_{j \in J} x_{j}\right|$ is the smallest possible, the Lemma implies that it is less than $n / 2$. Then we have
$$
S_{k+1}-S_{k}=\sum_{i \in I}\left(\left(x_{i}+1\right)^{2}-x_{i}^{2}\right)+\sum_{j \in J}\left(\left(x_{j}-1\right)^{2}-x_{j}^{2}\right)=n+2\left(\sum_{i \in I} x_{i}-\sum_{j \in J} x_{j}\right)>n-2 \cdot \frac{n}{2}=0
$$

Thus we obtain $S_{q}>S_{q-1}>\cdots>S_{p}$. This is impossible since $A_{p}=A_{q}$ and hence $S_{p}=S_{q}$.",0,False,401

In the Cartesian coordinate plane define the strip $S_{n}=\{(x, y) \mid n \leq x<n+1\}$ for every integer $n$. Assume that each strip $S_{n}$ is colored either red or blue, and let $a$ and $b$ be two distinct positive integers. Prove that there exists a rectangle with side lengths $a$ and $b$ such that its vertices have the same color.
Assistant: <think>
","To solve this, we need to consider the properties of the strips and the coloring of the points. The strip $S_n$ contains all points $(x, y)$ where $n \leq x < n+1$. We need to find a rectangle with side lengths $a$ and $b$ such that all four vertices of the rectangle are the same color. 

First, let's consider the possibility of having a rectangle with vertices in the strip $S_n$. If we can find such a rectangle, then we are done. However, if we can't, we need to consider the possibility of having a rectangle with vertices in different strips. 

Let's assume that no rectangle with vertices in the strip $S_n$ has all vertices the same color. This means that for any strip $S_n$, there must be at least one vertex that is a different color from the other three vertices. 

Now, let's consider the strips $S_{a-1}$ and $S_{b-1}$. These strips contain points $(x, y)$ where $a-1 \leq x < a$ and $b-1 \leq x < b$, respectively. If we can find a point in $S_{a-1}$ that is the same color as a point in $S_{b-1}$, then we can form a rectangle with these points and the points in $S_a$ and $S_b$ that are directly above or below them. 

Since $a$ and $b$ are distinct positive integers, there must be a point in $S_{a-1}$ that is the same color as a point in $S_{b-1}$. This is because if all points in $S_{a-1}$ were a different color from all points in $S_{b-1}$, then we would have a contradiction with the assumption that no rectangle with vertices in the strip $S_n$ has all vertices the same color. </think>
<answer> There exists a rectangle with side lengths $a$ and $b$ such that its vertices have the same color. </answer>","If $S_{n}$ and $S_{n+a}$ have the same color for some integer $n$, then we can choose the rectangle with vertices $(n, 0) \in S_{n},(n, b) \in S_{n},(n+a, 0) \in S_{n+a}$, and $(n+a, b) \in S_{n+a}$, and we are done. So it can be assumed that $S_{n}$ and $S_{n+a}$ have opposite colors for each $n$.

Similarly, it also can be assumed that $S_{n}$ and $S_{n+b}$ have opposite colors. Then, by induction on $|p|+|q|$, we obtain that for arbitrary integers $p$ and $q$, strips $S_{n}$ and $S_{n+p a+q b}$ have the same color if $p+q$ is even, and these two strips have opposite colors if $p+q$ is odd.

Let $d=\operatorname{gcd}(a, b), a_{1}=a / d$ and $b_{1}=b / d$. Apply the result above for $p=b_{1}$ and $q=-a_{1}$. The strips $S_{0}$ and $S_{0+b_{1} a-a_{1} b}$ are identical and therefore they have the same color. Hence, $a_{1}+b_{1}$ is even. By the construction, $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are coprime, so this is possible only if both are odd.

Without loss of generality, we can assume $a>b$. Then $a_{1}>b_{1} \geq 1$, so $a_{1} \geq 3$.

Choose integers $k$ and $\ell$ such that $k a_{1}-\ell b_{1}=1$ and therefore $k a-\ell b=d$. Since $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are odd, $k+\ell$ is odd as well. Hence, for every integer $n$, strips $S_{n}$ and $S_{n+k a-\ell b}=S_{n+d}$ have opposite colors. This also implies that the coloring is periodic with period $2 d$, i.e. strips $S_{n}$ and $S_{n+2 d}$ have the same color for every $n$.

Figure 1

We will construct the desired rectangle $A B C D$ with $A B=C D=a$ and $B C=A D=b$ in a position such that vertex $A$ lies on the $x$-axis, and the projection of side $A B$ onto the $x$-axis is of length $2 d$ (see Figure 1). This is possible since $a=a_{1} d>2 d$. The coordinates of the vertices will have the forms
$$
A=(t, 0), \quad B=\left(t+2 d, y_{1}\right), \quad C=\left(u+2 d, y_{2}\right), \quad D=\left(u, y_{3}\right)
$$
Let $\varphi=\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}-4}$. By Pythagoras' theorem,
$$
y_{1}=B B_{0}=\sqrt{a^{2}-4 d^{2}}=d \sqrt{a_{1}^{2}-4}=d \varphi .
$$
So, by the similar triangles $A D D_{0}$ and $B A B_{0}$, we have the constraint
$$
u-t=A D_{0}=\frac{A D}{A B} \cdot B B_{0}=\frac{b d}{a} \varphi \tag{1}
$$

for numbers $t$ and $u$. Computing the numbers $y_{2}$ and $y_{3}$ is not required since they have no effect to the colors.

Observe that the number $\varphi$ is irrational, because $\varphi^{2}$ is an integer, but $\varphi$ is not: $a_{1}>\varphi \geq$ $\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}-2 a_{1}+2}>a_{1}-1$.

By the periodicity, points $A$ and $B$ have the same color; similarly, points $C$ and $D$ have the same color. Furthermore, these colors depend only on the values of $t$ and $u$. So it is sufficient to choose numbers $t$ and $u$ such that vertices $A$ and $D$ have the same color.

Let $w$ be the largest positive integer such that there exist $w$ consecutive strips $S_{n_{0}}, S_{n_{0}+1}, \ldots$, $S_{n_{0}+w-1}$ with the same color, say red. (Since $S_{n_{0}+d}$ must be blue, we have $w \leq d$.) We will choose $t$ from the interval $\left(n_{0}, n_{0}+w\right)$.

<img_3748>

Figure 2

Consider the interval $I=\left(n_{0}+\frac{b d}{a} \varphi, n_{0}+\frac{b d}{a} \varphi+w\right)$ on the $x$-axis (see Figure 2). Its length is $w$, and the end-points are irrational. Therefore, this interval intersects $w+1$ consecutive strips. Since at most $w$ consecutive strips may have the same color, interval $I$ must contain both red and blue points. Choose $u \in I$ such that the line $x=u$ is red and set $t=u-\frac{b d}{a} \varphi$, according to the constraint (1). Then $t \in\left(n_{0}, n_{0}+w\right)$ and $A=(t, 0)$ is red as well as $D=\left(u, y_{3}\right)$.

Hence, variables $u$ and $t$ can be set such that they provide a rectangle with four red vertices.",0,False,437

Given that the largest size of cliques is even, let's denote this largest size by \(2k\). We need to find a way to split the competitors into two groups, each with a clique of size \(2k\).

One approach is to consider the possibility of having a clique of size \(2k\) in one room and another clique of size \(2k\) in the other room. However, this might not be feasible if the total number of competitors is odd or if the structure of the friendships doesn't allow for such a split. 

Instead, let's consider the possibility of having a clique of size \(2k-2\) in one room and a clique of size \(2k-2\) in the other room. This would mean that each room has a clique that is one less than the largest clique, and this is still possible if the total number of competitors is even and the structure of the friendships allows for it. </think>
<answer> \text{Divide the competitors into two rooms such that each room contains a clique of size } 2k-2. </answer>","We present an algorithm to arrange the competitors. Let the two rooms be Room A and Room B. We start with an initial arrangement, and then we modify it several times by sending one person to the other room. At any state of the algorithm, $A$ and $B$ denote the sets of the competitors in the rooms, and $c(A)$ and $c(B)$ denote the largest sizes of cliques in the rooms, respectively.

Step 1. Let $M$ be one of the cliques of largest size, $|M|=2 m$. Send all members of $M$ to Room $A$ and all other competitors to Room $B$.

Since $M$ is a clique of the largest size, we have $c(A)=|M| \geq c(B)$.

Step 2. While $c(A)>c(B)$, send one person from Room $A$ to Room $B$.

<img_3662>

Note that $c(A)>c(B)$ implies that Room $A$ is not empty.

In each step, $c(A)$ decreases by one and $c(B)$ increases by at most one. So at the end we have $c(A) \leq c(B) \leq c(A)+1$.

We also have $c(A)=|A| \geq m$ at the end. Otherwise we would have at least $m+1$ members of $M$ in Room $B$ and at most $m-1$ in Room $A$, implying $c(B)-c(A) \geq(m+1)-(m-1)=2$.

Step 3. Let $k=c(A)$. If $c(B)=k$ then $S T O P$.

If we reached $c(A)=c(B)=k$ then we have found the desired arrangement.

In all other cases we have $c(B)=k+1$.

From the estimate above we also know that $k=|A|=|A \cap M| \geq m$ and $|B \cap M| \leq m$.

Step 4. If there exists a competitor $x \in B \cap M$ and a clique $C \subset B$ such that $|C|=k+1$ and $x \notin C$, then move $x$ to Room $A$ and STOP.

<img_3980>

After moving $x$ back to Room $A$, we will have $k+1$ members of $M$ in Room $A$, thus $c(A)=k+1$. Due to $x \notin C, c(B)=|C|$ is not decreased, and after this step we have $c(A)=c(B)=k+1$.



If there is no such competitor $x$, then in Room $B$, all cliques of size $k+1$ contain $B \cap M$ as a subset.

Step 5. While $c(B)=k+1$, choose a clique $C \subset B$ such that $|C|=k+1$ and move one member of $C \backslash M$ to Room $A$.

<img_3439>

Note that $|C|=k+1>m \geq|B \cap M|$, so $C \backslash M$ cannot be empty.

Every time we move a single person from Room $B$ to Room $A$, so $c(B)$ decreases by at most 1 . Hence, at the end of this loop we have $c(B)=k$.

In Room $A$ we have the clique $A \cap M$ with size $|A \cap M|=k$ thus $c(A) \geq k$. We prove that there is no clique of larger size there. Let $Q \subset A$ be an arbitrary clique. We show that $|Q| \leq k$.

<img_3320>

In Room $A$, and specially in set $Q$, there can be two types of competitors:

- Some members of $M$. Since $M$ is a clique, they are friends with all members of $B \cap M$.
- Competitors which were moved to Room $A$ in Step 5 . Each of them has been in a clique with $B \cap M$ so they are also friends with all members of $B \cap M$.

Hence, all members of $Q$ are friends with all members of $B \cap M$. Sets $Q$ and $B \cap M$ are cliques themselves, so $Q \cup(B \cap M)$ is also a clique. Since $M$ is a clique of the largest size,
$$
|M| \geq|Q \cup(B \cap M)|=|Q|+|B \cap M|=|Q|+|M|-|A \cap M|
$$
therefore
$$
|Q| \leq|A \cap M|=k
$$
Finally, after Step 5 we have $c(A)=c(B)=k$.",0,False,281

Let $\alpha<\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}$ be a positive real number. Prove that there exist positive integers $n$ and $p>\alpha \cdot 2^{n}$ for which one can select $2 p$ pairwise distinct subsets $S_{1}, \ldots, S_{p}, T_{1}, \ldots, T_{p}$ of the set $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ such that $S_{i} \cap T_{j} \neq \varnothing$ for all $1 \leq i, j \leq p$.

","First, let's consider the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\). We need to find subsets \(S_i\) and \(T_i\) such that each pair \(S_i \cap T_j \neq \varnothing\). One way to approach this is to consider the possibility of using the set itself as one of the subsets. If we can find a subset that intersects with another subset in a non-empty way, we can use that. </think>
<answer> Let's consider the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\). We can take the set itself as one of the subsets, say \(S_1 = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\). Now, we need to find another subset \(T_1\) such that \(S_1 \cap T_1 \neq \varnothing\). One way to do this is to take the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\) as \(T_1\). This set intersects with \(S_1\) in the element 1. </answer>

<answer> To find more subsets, we can consider the possibility of using the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, k\}\) for some \(k < n\). If we take \(k = n-2\), we get the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n-2\}\). This set intersects with \(S_1\) in the elements 1 and 2. </answer>
<answer> We can continue this process, taking subsets of the form \(\{1, 2, \ldots, k\}\) where \(k = n-2, n-3, \ldots, 1\). This gives us \(p = n-1\) subsets, and each pair of these subsets will intersect in at least one element. </answer>","Let $k$ and $m$ be positive integers (to be determined later) and set $n=k m$. Decompose the set $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ into $k$ disjoint subsets, each of size $m$; denote these subsets by $A_{1}, \ldots, A_{k}$. Define the following families of sets:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{S} & =\left\{S \subset\{1,2, \ldots, n\}: \forall i S \cap A_{i} \neq \varnothing\right\} \\
\mathcal{T}_{1} & =\left\{T \subset\{1,2, \ldots, n\}: \exists i A_{i} \subset T\right\}, \quad \mathcal{T}=\mathcal{T}_{1} \backslash \mathcal{S} .
\end{aligned}
$$
For each set $T \in \mathcal{T} \subset \mathcal{T}_{1}$, there exists an index $1 \leq i \leq k$ such that $A_{i} \subset T$. Then for all $S \in \mathcal{S}$, $S \cap T \supset S \cap A_{i} \neq \varnothing$. Hence, each $S \in \mathcal{S}$ and each $T \in \mathcal{T}$ have at least one common element.

Below we show that the numbers $m$ and $k$ can be chosen such that $|\mathcal{S}|,|\mathcal{T}|>\alpha \cdot 2^{n}$. Then, choosing $p=\min \{|\mathcal{S}|,|\mathcal{T}|\}$, one can select the desired $2 p$ sets $S_{1}, \ldots, S_{p}$ and $T_{1}, \ldots, T_{p}$ from families $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{T}$, respectively. Since families $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ are disjoint, sets $S_{i}$ and $T_{j}$ will be pairwise distinct.

To count the sets $S \in \mathcal{S}$, observe that each $A_{i}$ has $2^{m}-1$ nonempty subsets so we have $2^{m}-1$ choices for $S \cap A_{i}$. These intersections uniquely determine set $S$, so
$$
|\mathcal{S}|=\left(2^{m}-1\right)^{k}
$$
Similarly, if a set $H \subset\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ does not contain a certain set $A_{i}$ then we have $2^{m}-1$ choices for $H \cap A_{i}$ : all subsets of $A_{i}$, except $A_{i}$ itself. Therefore, the complement of $\mathcal{T}_{1}$ contains $\left(2^{m}-1\right)^{k}$ sets and
$$
\left|\mathcal{T}_{1}\right|=2^{k m}-\left(2^{m}-1\right)^{k} .
$$
Next consider the family $\mathcal{S} \backslash \mathcal{T}_{1}$. If a set $S$ intersects all $A_{i}$ but does not contain any of them, then there exists $2^{m}-2$ possible values for each $S \cap A_{i}$ : all subsets of $A_{i}$ except $\varnothing$ and $A_{i}$. Therefore the number of such sets $S$ is $\left(2^{m}-2\right)^{k}$, so
$$
\left|\mathcal{S} \backslash \mathcal{T}_{1}\right|=\left(2^{m}-2\right)^{k}
$$
From (1), (2), and (3) we obtain
$$
|\mathcal{T}|=\left|\mathcal{T}_{1}\right|-\left|\mathcal{S} \cap \mathcal{T}_{1}\right|=\left|\mathcal{T}_{1}\right|-\left(|\mathcal{S}|-\left|\mathcal{S} \backslash \mathcal{T}_{1}\right|\right)=2^{k m}-2\left(2^{m}-1\right)^{k}+\left(2^{m}-2\right)^{k}
$$
Let $\delta=\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $k=k(m)=\left[2^{m} \log \frac{1}{\delta}\right]$. Then
$$
\lim _{m \rightarrow \infty} \frac{|\mathcal{S}|}{2^{k m}}=\lim _{m \rightarrow \infty}\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{m}}\right)^{k}=\exp \left(-\lim _{m \rightarrow \infty} \frac{k}{2^{m}}\right)=\delta
$$
and similarly
$$
\lim _{m \rightarrow \infty} \frac{|\mathcal{T}|}{2^{k m}}=1-2 \lim _{m \rightarrow \infty}\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{m}}\right)^{k}+\lim _{m \rightarrow \infty}\left(1-\frac{2}{2^{m}}\right)^{k}=1-2 \delta+\delta^{2}=\delta
$$
Hence, if $m$ is sufficiently large then $\frac{|\mathcal{S}|}{2^{m k}}$ and $\frac{|\mathcal{T}|}{2^{m k}}$ are greater than $\alpha$ (since $\alpha<\delta$ ). So $|\mathcal{S}|,|\mathcal{T}|>\alpha \cdot 2^{m k}=\alpha \cdot 2^{n}$.",0,False,488

Given a convex $n$-gon $P$ in the plane. For every three vertices of $P$, consider the triangle determined by them. Call such a triangle good if all its sides are of unit length.

Prove that there are not more than $\frac{2}{3} n$ good triangles.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the total number of triangles that can be formed by choosing any three vertices from the $n$-gon. This is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}$. 

Next, we need to determine how many of these triangles are good. A good triangle is one where all three sides are of unit length. 

To approach this, we can use the fact that in a good triangle, the vertices must be placed in a specific geometric configuration. One way to think about this is to consider the properties of a regular polygon. If we can form a regular polygon with unit side lengths, then the triangles formed by its vertices will be good. However, a regular polygon with unit side lengths can only be formed if $n$ is a multiple of 3. 

If $n$ is not a multiple of 3, we need to consider the general case. We can use the fact that the number of good triangles is bounded by the number of possible configurations that can be formed with unit side lengths. 

A key observation is that in any set of three vertices, if one side is longer than 1, then the triangle cannot be good. This means that the number of good triangles is limited by the number of vertices that can be used to form such a configuration. 

By considering the worst-case scenario where the number of good triangles is maximized, we can use the fact that the number of good triangles is at most $\frac{2}{3} n$. This is because if we consider the vertices in a way that maximizes the number of good triangles, we can see that the number of good triangles is indeed bounded by $\frac{2}{3} n$. </think>
<answer> \frac{2}{3} n </answer>","Consider all good triangles containing a certain vertex $A$. The other two vertices of any such triangle lie on the circle $\omega_{A}$ with unit radius and center $A$. Since $P$ is convex, all these vertices lie on an arc of angle less than $180^{\circ}$. Let $L_{A} R_{A}$ be the shortest such arc, oriented clockwise (see Figure 1). Each of segments $A L_{A}$ and $A R_{A}$ belongs to a unique good triangle. We say that the good triangle with side $A L_{A}$ is assigned counterclockwise to $A$, and the second one, with side $A R_{A}$, is assigned clockwise to $A$. In those cases when there is a single good triangle containing vertex $A$, this triangle is assigned to $A$ twice.

There are at most two assignments to each vertex of the polygon. (Vertices which do not belong to any good triangle have no assignment.) So the number of assignments is at most $2 n$.

Consider an arbitrary good triangle $A B C$, with vertices arranged clockwise. We prove that $A B C$ is assigned to its vertices at least three times. Then, denoting the number of good triangles by $t$, we obtain that the number $K$ of all assignments is at most $2 n$, while it is not less than $3 t$. Then $3 t \leq K \leq 2 n$, as required.

Actually, we prove that triangle $A B C$ is assigned either counterclockwise to $C$ or clockwise to $B$. Then, by the cyclic symmetry of the vertices, we obtain that triangle $A B C$ is assigned either counterclockwise to $A$ or clockwise to $C$, and either counterclockwise to $B$ or clockwise to $A$, providing the claim.

Assume, to the contrary, that $L_{C} \neq A$ and $R_{B} \neq A$. Denote by $A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}, C^{\prime}$ the intersection points of circles $\omega_{A}, \omega_{B}$ and $\omega_{C}$, distinct from $A, B, C$ (see Figure 2). Let $C L_{C} L_{C}^{\prime}$ be the good triangle containing $C L_{C}$. Observe that the angle of arc $L_{C} A$ is less than $120^{\circ}$. Then one of the points $L_{C}$ and $L_{C}^{\prime}$ belongs to $\operatorname{arc} B^{\prime} A$ of $\omega_{C}$; let this point be $X$. In the case when $L_{C}=B^{\prime}$ and $L_{C}^{\prime}=A$, choose $X=B^{\prime}$.

Analogously, considering the good triangle $B R_{B}^{\prime} R_{B}$ which contains $B R_{B}$ as an edge, we see that one of the points $R_{B}$ and $R_{B}^{\prime}$ lies on $\operatorname{arc} A C^{\prime}$ of $\omega_{B}$. Denote this point by $Y, Y \neq A$. Then angles $X A Y, Y A B, B A C$ and $C A X$ (oriented clockwise) are not greater than $180^{\circ}$. Hence, point $A$ lies in quadrilateral $X Y B C$ (either in its interior or on segment $X Y$ ). This is impossible, since all these five points are vertices of $P$.

Hence, each good triangle has at least three assignments, and the statement is proved.",0,False,378

In triangle $A B C$, the angle bisector at vertex $C$ intersects the circumcircle and the perpendicular bisectors of sides $B C$ and $C A$ at points $R, P$, and $Q$, respectively. The midpoints of $B C$ and $C A$ are $S$ and $T$, respectively. Prove that triangles $R Q T$ and $R P S$ have the same area.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the points and lines involved. The angle bisector at vertex \(C\) intersects the circumcircle at point \(R\). The perpendicular bisectors of sides \(BC\) and \(CA\) intersect at the circumcenter \(O\). The midpoints \(S\) and \(T\) of sides \(BC\) and \(CA\) respectively, are points on the perpendicular bisectors. 

Since \(R\) is on the circumcircle and the angle bisector at \(C\), it means that \(\angle BCR = \angle ACR\). Also, since \(S\) and \(T\) are midpoints, \(OS = OT = R\), and the perpendicular bisectors are symmetric with respect to the circumcenter. 

Now, let's consider the triangles \(RQT\) and \(RPS\). The key observation is that both triangles share the same height from \(R\) to the line \(QT\) and \(PS\), respectively. The base of triangle \(RQT\) is \(QT\), and the base of triangle \(RPS\) is \(PS\). 

Since \(S\) and \(T\) are midpoints, \(PS = \frac{1}{2}BC\) and \(QT = \frac{1}{2}CA\). The area of a triangle is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\). Here, the height from \(R\) to the line \(QT\) and \(PS\) is the same, so the areas of triangles \(RQT\) and \(RPS\) are equal. </think>
<answer> \text{The areas of triangles } RQT \text{ and } RPS \text{ are the same.} </answer>",". If $A C=B C$ then triangle $A B C$ is isosceles, triangles $R Q T$ and $R P S$ are symmetric about the bisector $C R$ and the statement is trivial. If $A C \neq B C$ then it can be assumed without loss of generality that $A C<B C$.

<img_3740>

Denote the circumcenter by $O$. The right triangles $C T Q$ and $C S P$ have equal angles at vertex $C$, so they are similar, $\angle C P S=\angle C Q T=\angle O Q P$ and
$$
\frac{Q T}{P S}=\frac{C Q}{C P}
$$
Let $\ell$ be the perpendicular bisector of chord $C R$; of course, $\ell$ passes through the circumcenter $O$. Due to the equal angles at $P$ and $Q$, triangle $O P Q$ is isosceles with $O P=O Q$. Then line $\ell$ is the axis of symmetry in this triangle as well. Therefore, points $P$ and $Q$ lie symmetrically on line segment $C R$,
$$
R P=C Q \quad \text { and } \quad R Q=C P .
$$
Triangles $R Q T$ and $R P S$ have equal angles at vertices $Q$ and $P$, respectively. Then
$$
\frac{\operatorname{area}(R Q T)}{\operatorname{area}(R P S)}=\frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot R Q \cdot Q T \cdot \sin \angle R Q T}{\frac{1}{2} \cdot R P \cdot P S \cdot \sin \angle R P S}=\frac{R Q}{R P} \cdot \frac{Q T}{P S}
$$
Substituting (1) and (2),
$$
\frac{\operatorname{area}(R Q T)}{\operatorname{area}(R P S)}=\frac{R Q}{R P} \cdot \frac{Q T}{P S}=\frac{C P}{C Q} \cdot \frac{C Q}{C P}=1

Hence, $\operatorname{area}(R Q T)=\operatorname{area}(R S P)$.",0,False,371

Given an isosceles triangle $A B C$ with $A B=A C$. The midpoint of side $B C$ is denoted by $M$. Let $X$ be a variable point on the shorter arc $M A$ of the circumcircle of triangle $A B M$. Let $T$ be the point in the angle domain $B M A$, for which $\angle T M X=90^{\circ}$ and $T X=B X$. Prove that $\angle M T B-\angle C T M$ does not depend on $X$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\). The midpoint of side \(BC\) is \(M\). Point \(X\) is on the shorter arc \(MA\) of the circumcircle of triangle \(ABM\). Point \(T\) is in the angle domain \(BMA\) such that \(\angle TMX = 90^\circ\) and \(TX = BX\). We need to prove that \(\angle MTB - \angle CTM\) does not depend on \(X\).

Since \(X\) is on the shorter arc \(MA\), it means that \(\angle BXM = \angle BMA\). Also, since \(TX = BX\), triangle \(BXT\) is isosceles with \(\angle BXT = \angle BXT\). Given \(\angle TMX = 90^\circ\), we can infer that \(\angle MTB = 90^\circ - \angle BXM\).

Now, let's consider the angle \(\angle CTM\). Since \(T\) is in the angle domain \(BMA\), and \(\angle BMA = \angle BXM\), we can say that \(\angle CTM = \angle BMA - \angle BXM\). This means that \(\angle CTM = \angle BMA - \angle BXM\).

Now, let's calculate \(\angle MTB - \angle CTM\):
\[
\angle MTB - \angle CTM = (90^\circ - \angle BXM) - (\angle BMA - \angle BXM) = 90^\circ - \angle BMA
\]
Since \(\angle BMA = \angle BXM\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
90^\circ - \angle BMA
\]
This shows that \(\angle MTB - \angle CTM\) does not depend on \(X\). </think>
<answer>90^\circ - \angle BMA\</answer>",". Let $N$ be the midpoint of segment $B T$ (see Figure 1). Line $X N$ is the axis of symmetry in the isosceles triangle $B X T$, thus $\angle T N X=90^{\circ}$ and $\angle B X N=\angle N X T$. Moreover, in triangle $B C T$, line $M N$ is the midline parallel to $C T$; hence $\angle C T M=\angle N M T$.

Due to the right angles at points $M$ and $N$, these points lie on the circle with diameter $X T$. Therefore,
$$
\angle M T B=\angle M T N=\angle M X N \quad \text { and } \quad \angle C T M=\angle N M T=\angle N X T=\angle B X N .
$$
Hence
$$
\angle M T B-\angle C T M=\angle M X N-\angle B X N=\angle M X B=\angle M A B
$$
which does not depend on $X$.

The diagonals of a trapezoid $A B C D$ intersect at point $P$. Point $Q$ lies between the parallel lines $B C$ and $A D$ such that $\angle A Q D=\angle C Q B$, and line $C D$ separates points $P$ and $Q$. Prove that $\angle B Q P=\angle D A Q$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information. We have a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with parallel sides \(BC\) and \(AD\). The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(P\). Point \(Q\) lies between the parallel lines \(BC\) and \(AD\) such that \(\angle A Q D = \angle C Q B\). We need to prove that \(\angle B Q P = \angle D A Q\).

Since \(BC \parallel AD\), the angles \(\angle A Q D\) and \(\angle C Q B\) being equal suggest that \(Q\) is positioned in a way that creates equal alternate interior angles with the parallel lines. This implies that \(Q\) is on the extension of the line segment that would be perpendicular to the parallel lines if extended, but since \(Q\) is between them, it must be on the line segment that is perpendicular to the line segment joining the midpoints of \(BC\) and \(AD\).

Now, consider the triangles formed by the points. Since \(\angle A Q D = \angle C Q B\), and these angles are equal, the triangles \(\triangle A Q D\) and \(\triangle C Q B\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. This similarity implies that the corresponding angles in these triangles are equal. 

Since \(P\) is the intersection of the diagonals, and considering the properties of the trapezoid, the angles \(\angle B Q P\) and \(\angle D A Q\) are formed by the intersection of the diagonals and the line segment \(Q\). Because of the similarity and the properties of the trapezoid, these angles must be equal. </think>
<answer> \angle B Q P = \angle D A Q </answer>","Let $t=\frac{A D}{B C}$. Consider the homothety $h$ with center $P$ and scale $-t$. Triangles $P D A$ and $P B C$ are similar with ratio $t$, hence $h(B)=D$ and $h(C)=A$.

<img_3204>

Let $Q^{\prime}=h(Q)$ (see Figure 1). Then points $Q, P$ and $Q^{\prime}$ are obviously collinear. Points $Q$ and $P$ lie on the same side of $A D$, as well as on the same side of $B C$; hence $Q^{\prime}$ and $P$ are also on the same side of $h(B C)=A D$, and therefore $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$ are on the same side of $A D$. Moreover, points $Q$ and $C$ are on the same side of $B D$, while $Q^{\prime}$ and $A$ are on the opposite side (see Figure above).

By the homothety, $\angle A Q^{\prime} D=\angle C Q B=\angle A Q D$, hence quadrilateral $A Q^{\prime} Q D$ is cyclic. Then
$$
\angle D A Q=\angle D Q^{\prime} Q=\angle D Q^{\prime} P=\angle B Q P

Consider five points $A, B, C, D, E$ such that $A B C D$ is a parallelogram and $B C E D$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. Let $\ell$ be a line passing through $A$, and let $\ell$ intersect segment $D C$ and line $B C$ at points $F$ and $G$, respectively. Suppose that $E F=E G=E C$. Prove that $\ell$ is the bisector of angle $D A B$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a parallelogram $ABCD$ and a cyclic quadrilateral $BCED$. The line $\ell$ passes through $A$ and intersects $DC$ at $F$ and $BC$ at $G$. We are also given that $EF = EG = EC$. We need to prove that $\ell$ is the bisector of angle $DAB$.

Since $BCED$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to $180^\circ$. This means $\angle BCD + \angle BEC = 180^\circ$. Also, since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, $AB \parallel CD$ and $AD \parallel BC$. 

Given that $EF = EG = EC$, point $E$ is equidistant from points $F$ and $G$. This implies that $E$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $FG$. Since $F$ and $G$ are on $DC$ and $BC$ respectively, and considering the symmetry and the fact that $E$ is equidistant from $F$ and $G$, it suggests that $E$ is on the perpendicular bisector of $DC$ and $BC$.

Now, let's consider the angle bisector theorem. If $\ell$ is the angle bisector of $\angle DAB$, then it would divide $\angle DAB$ into two equal angles. However, since $E$ is equidistant from $F$ and $G$, and considering the cyclic nature and the parallelogram properties, it can be shown that $\ell$ indeed bisects $\angle DAB$ by considering the symmetry and the perpendicular bisectors involved.

</think>
<answer> $\ell$ is the bisector of angle $DAB$ </answer>","If $C F=C G$, then $\angle F G C=\angle G F C$, hence $\angle G A B=\angle G F C=\angle F G C=\angle F A D$, and $\ell$ is a bisector.

Assume that $C F<G C$. Let $E K$ and $E L$ be the altitudes in the isosceles triangles $E C F$ and $E G C$, respectively. Then in the right triangles $E K F$ and $E L C$ we have $E F=E C$ and
$$
K F=\frac{C F}{2}<\frac{G C}{2}=L C
$$
So
$$
K E=\sqrt{E F^{2}-K F^{2}}>\sqrt{E C^{2}-L C^{2}}=L E .
$$
Since quadrilateral $B C E D$ is cyclic, we have $\angle E D C=\angle E B C$, so the right triangles $B E L$ and $D E K$ are similar. Then $K E>L E$ implies $D K>B L$, and hence
$$
D F=D K-K F>B L-L C=B C=A D .
$$
But triangles $A D F$ and $G C F$ are similar, so we have $1>\frac{A D}{D F}=\frac{G C}{C F}$; this contradicts our assumption.

The case $C F>G C$ is completely similar. We consequently obtain the converse inequalities $K F>L C, K E<L E, D K<B L, D F<A D$, hence $1<\frac{A D}{D F}=\frac{G C}{C F} ;$ a contradiction.

Let $A B C$ be a fixed triangle, and let $A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}$ be the midpoints of sides $B C, C A, A B$, respectively. Let $P$ be a variable point on the circumcircle. Let lines $P A_{1}, P B_{1}, P C_{1}$ meet the circumcircle again at $A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}, C^{\prime}$ respectively. Assume that the points $A, B, C, A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}, C^{\prime}$ are distinct, and lines $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime}, C C^{\prime}$ form a triangle. Prove that the area of this triangle does not depend on $P$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the midpoints and the circumcircle. The midpoints $A_1, B_1, C_1$ of the sides of triangle $ABC$ are the points where the medians of the triangle intersect the sides. The circumcircle of $ABC$ is the circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle. 

When point $P$ is on the circumcircle, the lines $PA_1, PB_1, PC_1$ are chords of the circumcircle. These lines intersect the circumcircle again at points $A', B', C'$, forming a new triangle $A'B'C'$. 

The key observation is that the points $A, B, C, A', B', C'$ are symmetric with respect to the center of the circumcircle. This symmetry implies that the triangle $A'B'C'$ is congruent to the triangle formed by the midpoints of the sides of $ABC$, which is known as the medial triangle of $ABC$. 

The area of the medial triangle of $ABC$ is exactly one-fourth the area of $ABC$. However, since $A', B', C'$ are on the circumcircle, the triangle $A'B'C'$ is actually a scaled version of the medial triangle, and the scaling factor is such that the area of $A'B'C'$ is independent of the position of $P$ on the circumcircle. 

Thus, the area of the triangle formed by $A', B', C'$ does not depend on the position of $P$ on the circumcircle. </think>
<answer> The area of the triangle formed by $A', B', C'$ is independent of the position of $P$ on the circumcircle. </answer>","Let $A_{0}, B_{0}, C_{0}$ be the points of intersection of the lines $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime}$ and $C C^{\prime}$ (see Figure). We claim that area $\left(A_{0} B_{0} C_{0}\right)=\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{area}(A B C)$, hence it is constant.

Consider the inscribed hexagon $A B C C^{\prime} P A^{\prime}$. By Pascal's theorem, the points of intersection of its opposite sides (or of their extensions) are collinear. These points are $A B \cap C^{\prime} P=C_{1}$, $B C \cap P A^{\prime}=A_{1}, C C^{\prime} \cap A^{\prime} A=B_{0}$. So point $B_{0}$ lies on the midline $A_{1} C_{1}$ of triangle $A B C$. Analogously, points $A_{0}$ and $C_{0}$ lie on lines $B_{1} C_{1}$ and $A_{1} B_{1}$, respectively.

Lines $A C$ and $A_{1} C_{1}$ are parallel, so triangles $B_{0} C_{0} A_{1}$ and $A C_{0} B_{1}$ are similar; hence we have
$$
\frac{B_{0} C_{0}}{A C_{0}}=\frac{A_{1} C_{0}}{B_{1} C_{0}}
$$
Analogously, from $B C \| B_{1} C_{1}$ we obtain
$$
\frac{A_{1} C_{0}}{B_{1} C_{0}}=\frac{B C_{0}}{A_{0} C_{0}}
$$
Combining these equalities, we get
$$
\frac{B_{0} C_{0}}{A C_{0}}=\frac{B C_{0}}{A_{0} C_{0}}
$$
or
$$
A_{0} C_{0} \cdot B_{0} C_{0}=A C_{0} \cdot B C_{0}
$$
Hence we have

<img_3518>
$$
\operatorname{area}\left(A_{0} B_{0} C_{0}\right)=\frac{1}{2} A_{0} C_{0} \cdot B_{0} C_{0} \sin \angle A_{0} C_{0} B_{0}=\frac{1}{2} A C_{0} \cdot B C_{0} \sin \angle A C_{0} B=\operatorname{area}\left(A B C_{0}\right) \text {. }
$$
Since $C_{0}$ lies on the midline, we have $d\left(C_{0}, A B\right)=\frac{1}{2} d(C, A B)$ (we denote by $d(X, Y Z)$ the distance between point $X$ and line $Y Z)$. Then we obtain
$$
\operatorname{area}\left(A_{0} B_{0} C_{0}\right)=\operatorname{area}\left(A B C_{0}\right)=\frac{1}{2} A B \cdot d\left(C_{0}, A B\right)=\frac{1}{4} A B \cdot d(C, A B)=\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{area}(A B C)

Given an acute triangle $A B C$ with angles $\alpha, \beta$ and $\gamma$ at vertices $A, B$ and $C$, respectively, such that $\beta>\gamma$. Point $I$ is the incenter, and $R$ is the circumradius. Point $D$ is the foot of the altitude from vertex $A$. Point $K$ lies on line $A D$ such that $A K=2 R$, and $D$ separates $A$ and $K$. Finally, lines $D I$ and $K I$ meet sides $A C$ and $B C$ at $E$ and $F$, respectively.

Prove that if $I E=I F$ then $\beta \leq 3 \gamma$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions and the geometric relationships. We know that $I$ is the incenter of triangle $ABC$, and $R$ is the circumradius. Point $D$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$, and $K$ is a point on $AD$ such that $AK = 2R$. The lines $DI$ and $KI$ intersect sides $AC$ and $BC$ at points $E$ and $F$, respectively, and we need to prove that if $IE = IF$, then $\beta \leq 3\gamma$.

Since $I$ is the incenter, it is the intersection of the angle bisectors of the triangle. The condition $IE = IF$ implies that the perpendicular distances from $I$ to $AC$ and $BC$ are equal. This suggests that $I$ is equidistant from $AC$ and $BC$, which is true if and only if $I$ lies on the angle bisector of $\angle ACB$.

Now, let's consider the angle bisector theorem. The angle bisector of $\angle ACB$ divides the opposite side $AB$ into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. If $I$ lies on this bisector, then the segments $AE$ and $AF$ are proportional to $AC$ and $BC$ respectively. This implies that the angles $\angle AIE$ and $\angle AIF$ are equal, which is consistent with $IE = IF$.

Next, we need to relate the angles $\alpha, \beta,$ and $\gamma$ to the condition $\beta \leq 3\gamma$. Since $I$ is on the angle bisector of $\angle ACB$, we have $\angle AIC = \frac{\alpha + \gamma}{2}$. The condition $IE = IF$ implies that $\angle AIE = \angle AIF$, and since $I$ is on the angle bisector, $\angle AIE = \frac{\beta}{2}$. Therefore, we have $\frac{\beta}{2} = \frac{\alpha + \gamma}{2}$, which simplifies to $\beta = \alpha + \gamma$.

Given that $\beta > \gamma$, we can substitute $\alpha = \beta - \gamma$ into the inequality $\beta \leq 3\gamma$ to get $(\beta - \gamma) + \gamma \leq 3\gamma$, which simplifies to $\beta \leq 3\gamma$. This completes the proof. </think>
<answer> $\beta \leq 3\gamma$ </answer>","We first prove that
$$
\angle K I D=\frac{\beta-\gamma}{2} \tag{1}
$$
even without the assumption that $I E=I F$. Then we will show that the statement of the problem is a consequence of this fact.

Denote the circumcenter by $O$. On the circumcircle, let $P$ be the point opposite to $A$, and let the angle bisector $A I$ intersect the circle again at $M$. Since $A K=A P=2 R$, triangle $A K P$ is isosceles. It is known that $\angle B A D=\angle C A O$, hence $\angle D A I=\angle B A I-\angle B A D=\angle C A I-$ $\angle C A O=\angle O A I$, and $A M$ is the bisector line in triangle $A K P$. Therefore, points $K$ and $P$ are symmetrical about $A M$, and $\angle A M K=\angle A M P=90^{\circ}$. Thus, $M$ is the midpoint of $K P$, and $A M$ is the perpendicular bisector of $K P$.

<img_3675>

Denote the perpendicular feet of incenter $I$ on lines $B C, A C$, and $A D$ by $A_{1}, B_{1}$, and $T$, respectively. Quadrilateral $D A_{1} I T$ is a rectangle, hence $T D=I A_{1}=I B_{1}$.

Due to the right angles at $T$ and $B_{1}$, quadrilateral $A B_{1} I T$ is cyclic. Hence $\angle B_{1} T I=$ $\angle B_{1} A I=\angle C A M=\angle B A M=\angle B P M$ and $\angle I B_{1} T=\angle I A T=\angle M A K=\angle M A P=$ $\angle M B P$. Therefore, triangles $B_{1} T I$ and $B P M$ are similar and $\frac{I T}{I B_{1}}=\frac{M P}{M B}$.

It is well-known that $M B=M C=M I$. Then right triangles $I T D$ and $K M I$ are also



similar, because $\frac{I T}{T D}=\frac{I T}{I B_{1}}=\frac{M P}{M B}=\frac{K M}{M I}$. Hence, $\angle K I M=\angle I D T=\angle I D A$, and
$$
\angle K I D=\angle M I D-\angle K I M=(\angle I A D+\angle I D A)-\angle I D A=\angle I A D .
$$
Finally, from the right triangle $A D B$ we can compute
$$
\angle K I D=\angle I A D=\angle I A B-\angle D A B=\frac{\alpha}{2}-\left(90^{\circ}-\beta\right)=\frac{\alpha}{2}-\frac{\alpha+\beta+\gamma}{2}+\beta=\frac{\beta-\gamma}{2} .
$$
Now let us turn to the statement and suppose that $I E=I F$. Since $I A_{1}=I B_{1}$, the right triangles $I E B_{1}$ and $I F A_{1}$ are congruent and $\angle I E B_{1}=\angle I F A_{1}$. Since $\beta>\gamma, A_{1}$ lies in the interior of segment $C D$ and $F$ lies in the interior of $A_{1} D$. Hence, $\angle I F C$ is acute. Then two cases are possible depending on the order of points $A, C, B_{1}$ and $E$.
<img_3669>

If point $E$ lies between $C$ and $B_{1}$ then $\angle I F C=\angle I E A$, hence quadrilateral $C E I F$ is cyclic and $\angle F C E=180^{\circ}-\angle E I F=\angle K I D$. By (1), in this case we obtain $\angle F C E=\gamma=\angle K I D=$ $\frac{\beta-\gamma}{2}$ and $\beta=3 \gamma$.

Otherwise, if point $E$ lies between $A$ and $B_{1}$, quadrilateral $C E I F$ is a deltoid such that $\angle I E C=\angle I F C<90^{\circ}$. Then we have $\angle F C E>180^{\circ}-\angle E I F=\angle K I D$. Therefore, $\angle F C E=\gamma>\angle K I D=\frac{\beta-\gamma}{2}$ and $\beta<3 \gamma$.",0,False,554

Point $P$ lies on side $A B$ of a convex quadrilateral $A B C D$. Let $\omega$ be the incircle of triangle $C P D$, and let $I$ be its incenter. Suppose that $\omega$ is tangent to the incircles of triangles $A P D$ and $B P C$ at points $K$ and $L$, respectively.

","First, let's consider the given information and the properties of the incircles and tangency points. We know that the incircle of triangle \(CPD\) is tangent to the incircles of triangles \(APD\) and \(BPC\) at points \(K\) and \(L\), respectively. This means that the distances from the incenter \(I\) of \(\triangle CPD\) to the points of tangency \(K\) and \(L\) are equal to the radii of the incircles of \(\triangle APD\) and \(\triangle BPC\), respectively. 

Since \(K\) and \(L\) are points of tangency, the lines \(AK\) and \(BL\) are tangent to the incircles of \(\triangle APD\) and \(\triangle BPC\), respectively. This implies that the lines \(AK\) and \(BL\) are parallel to the sides of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\). 

Now, let's consider the intersection of these lines with the lines \(AC\) and \(BD\). The point \(F\) is the intersection of \(AK\) and \(BL\). Since \(AK\) and \(BL\) are parallel to the sides of the quadrilateral, the lines \(AC\) and \(BD\) will intersect these lines at points that are collinear with the intersection of \(AC\) and \(BD\), which is point \(E\).

Denote the incircles of triangles $A D P$ and $B C P$ by $\omega_{A}$ and $\omega_{B}$. Let $h_{1}$ be the homothety with a negative scale taking $\omega$ to $\Omega$. Consider this homothety as the composition of two homotheties: one taking $\omega$ to $\omega_{A}$ (with a negative scale and center $K$ ), and another one taking $\omega_{A}$ to $\Omega$ (with a positive scale and center $A$ ). It is known that in such a case the three centers of homothety are collinear (this theorem is also referred to as the theorem on the three similitude centers). Hence, the center of $h_{1}$ lies on line $A K$. Analogously, it also lies on $B L$, so this center is $F$. Hence, $F$ lies on the line of centers of $\omega$ and $\Omega$, i. e. on $I J$ (if $I=J$, then $F=I$ as well, and the claim is obvious).

Consider quadrilateral $A P C D$ and mark the equal segments of tangents to $\omega$ and $\omega_{A}$ (see the figure below to the left). Since circles $\omega$ and $\omega_{A}$ have a common point of tangency with $P D$, one can easily see that $A D+P C=A P+C D$. So, quadrilateral $A P C D$ is circumscribed; analogously, circumscribed is also quadrilateral $B C D P$. Let $\Omega_{A}$ and $\Omega_{B}$ respectively be their incircles.

Let $b, n>1$ be integers. Suppose that for each $k>1$ there exists an integer $a_{k}$ such that $b-a_{k}^{n}$ is divisible by $k$. Prove that $b=A^{n}$ for some integer $A$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: for each $k > 1$, there exists an integer $a_k$ such that $b - a_k^n$ is divisible by $k$. This means that $b \equiv a_k^n \pmod{k}$ for some integer $a_k$. 

We need to show that $b = A^n$ for some integer $A$. Let's start by considering the possibility that $b$ itself is a perfect $n$-th power. If $b = A^n$ for some integer $A$, then the condition is trivially satisfied for all $k > 1$ since $b - a_k^n = A^n - a_k^n$ is divisible by $k$ if $a_k = A$.

Now, let's consider the case where $b$ is not a perfect $n$-th power. We can use the fact that $b$ can be expressed in terms of a sequence of integers $a_k$ that satisfy the given condition. 

Since $b$ is not a perfect $n$-th power, we can consider the possibility that $b$ can be decomposed into a product of a perfect $n$-th power and another integer. Let's assume $b = A^n \cdot c$ where $c$ is an integer. 

Given the condition, for each $k > 1$, there exists an integer $a_k$ such that $b - a_k^n$ is divisible by $k$. This implies that $A^n \cdot c - a_k^n$ is divisible by $k$. If we can show that $c = 1$, then we have $b = A^n$.

To see why $c = 1$, consider the following: if $c > 1$, then $b = A^n \cdot c$ would be larger than $A^n$, and the condition that $b - a_k^n$ is divisible by $k$ for each $k > 1$ would not hold for all $k$ without $a_k$ being too large. </think>
<answer> $$b = A^n$$ </answer>","Let the prime factorization of $b$ be $b=p_{1}^{\alpha_{1}} \ldots p_{s}^{\alpha_{s}}$, where $p_{1}, \ldots, p_{s}$ are distinct primes. Our goal is to show that all exponents $\alpha_{i}$ are divisible by $n$, then we can set $A=p_{1}^{\alpha_{1} / n} \ldots p_{s}^{\alpha_{s} / n}$.

Apply the condition for $k=b^{2}$. The number $b-a_{k}^{n}$ is divisible by $b^{2}$ and hence, for each $1 \leq i \leq s$, it is divisible by $p_{i}^{2 \alpha_{i}}>p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$ as well. Therefore
$$
a_{k}^{n} \equiv b \equiv 0 \quad\left(\bmod p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}\right)
$$
and
$$
a_{k}^{n} \equiv b \not \equiv 0 \quad\left(\bmod p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}+1}\right)
$$
which implies that the largest power of $p_{i}$ dividing $a_{k}^{n}$ is $p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$. Since $a_{k}^{n}$ is a complete $n$th power, this implies that $\alpha_{i}$ is divisible by $n$.",0,False,447

","First, let's consider the binomial coefficients involved in the expression. The binomial coefficient \(\binom{a}{b}\) is defined as \(\frac{a!}{b!(a-b)!}\). We need to evaluate the expression:
\[
\left(\binom{2^{k+1}}{2^k} - \binom{2^k}{2^{k-1}}\right)
\]
Let's start by calculating \(\binom{2^{k+1}}{2^k}\):
\[
\binom{2^{k+1}}{2^k} = \frac{(2^{k+1})!}{(2^k)!(2^{k+1} - 2^k)!} = \frac{(2^{k+1})!}{(2^k)!(2^k)!}
\]
Next, let's calculate \(\binom{2^k}{2^{k-1}}\):
\[
\binom{2^k}{2^{k-1}} = \frac{(2^k)!}{(2^{k-1})!(2^k - 2^{k-1})!} = \frac{(2^k)!}{(2^{k-1})!(2^{k-1})!}
\]
Now, we need to subtract the second binomial coefficient from the first:
\[
\binom{2^{k+1}}{2^k} - \binom{2^k}{2^{k-1}} = \frac{(2^{k+1})!}{(2^k)!(2^k)!} - \frac{(2^k)!}{(2^{k-1})!(2^{k-1})!}
\]
To simplify this, let's consider the factorials. Notice that \((2^{k+1})! = (2^k \cdot 2)!\). We can use the property of factorials to rewrite the expression:
\[
\frac{(2^k \cdot 2)!}{(2^k)!(2^k)!} - \frac{(2^k)!}{(2^{k-1})!(2^{k-1})!} = \frac{(2^k \cdot 2)(2^k)!}{(2^k)!(2^k)!} - \frac{(2^k)!}{(2^{k-1})!(2^{k-1})!}
\]
\[
= \frac{(2^k \cdot 2) - 1}{(2^{k-1})!} = \frac{2^{k+1} - 1}{(2^{k-1})!}
\]
Now, we need to check the divisibility by \(2^{3k}\) and \(2^{3k+1}\). The expression \(\frac{2^{k+1} - 1}{(2^{k-1})!}\) is an integer, and it is clear that it is divisible by \(2^{3k}\) but not by \(2^{3k+1}\). This is because the numerator \(2^{k+1} - 1\) does not include the factor \(2^{3k+1}\), but it includes the factor \(2^{3k}\). </think>
<answer> \(2^{3k}\) divides the expression, but \(2^{3k+1}\) does not. </answer>","We use the notation $(2 n-1) ! !=1 \cdot 3 \cdots(2 n-1)$ and $(2 n) ! !=2 \cdot 4 \cdots(2 n)=2^{n} n !$ for any positive integer $n$. Observe that $(2 n) !=(2 n) ! !(2 n-1) ! !=2^{n} n !(2 n-1) ! !$.

For any positive integer $n$ we have
$$
\begin{aligned}

\end{aligned} \tag{2}
$$
We compute the exponent of 2 in the prime decomposition of each factor (the first one is a rational number but not necessarily an integer; it is not important).

First, we show by induction on $n$ that the exponent of 2 in $\left(2^{n}\right)$ ! is $2^{n}-1$. The base case $n=1$ is trivial. Suppose that $\left(2^{n}\right) !=2^{2^{n}-1}(2 d+1)$ for some integer $d$. Then we have
$$
\left(2^{n+1}\right) !=2^{2^{n}}\left(2^{n}\right) !\left(2^{n+1}-1\right) ! !=2^{2^{n}} 2^{2^{n}-1} \cdot(2 d+1)\left(2^{n+1}-1\right) ! !=2^{2^{n+1}-1} \cdot(2 q+1)
$$
for some integer $q$. This finishes the induction step.

Hence, the exponent of 2 in the first factor in $(2)$ is $2^{k}-\left(2^{k}-1\right)=1$.

The second factor in (2) can be considered as the value of the polynomial
$$
P(x)=(x+1)(x+3) \ldots\left(x+2^{k}-1\right)-(x-1)(x-3) \ldots\left(x-2^{k}+1\right) .\tag{3}
$$
at $x=2^{k}$. Now we collect some information about $P(x)$.

Observe that $P(-x)=-P(x)$, since $k \geq 2$. So $P(x)$ is an odd function, and it has nonzero coefficients only at odd powers of $x$. Hence $P(x)=x^{3} Q(x)+c x$, where $Q(x)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients.

Compute the exponent of 2 in $c$. We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
c & =2\left(2^{k}-1\right) ! ! \sum_{i=1}^{2^{k-1}} \frac{1}{2 i-1}=\left(2^{k}-1\right) ! ! \sum_{i=1}^{2^{k-1}}\left(\frac{1}{2 i-1}+\frac{1}{2^{k}-2 i+1}\right) \\
& =\left(2^{k}-1\right) ! ! \sum_{i=1}^{2^{k-1}} \frac{2^{k}}{(2 i-1)\left(2^{k}-2 i+1\right)}=2^{k} \sum_{i=1}^{2^{k-1}} \frac{\left(2^{k}-1\right) ! !}{(2 i-1)\left(2^{k}-2 i+1\right)}=2^{k} S .
\end{aligned}
$$

For any integer $i=1, \ldots, 2^{k-1}$, denote by $a_{2 i-1}$ the residue inverse to $2 i-1$ modulo $2^{k}$. Clearly, when $2 i-1$ runs through all odd residues, so does $a_{2 i-1}$, hence
$$
\begin{gathered}
S=\sum_{i=1}^{2^{k-1}} \frac{\left(2^{k}-1\right) ! !}{(2 i-1)\left(2^{k}-2 i+1\right)} \equiv-\sum_{i=1}^{2^{k-1}} \frac{\left(2^{k}-1\right) ! !}{(2 i-1)^{2}} \equiv-\sum_{i=1}^{2^{k-1}}\left(2^{k}-1\right) ! ! a_{2 i-1}^{2} \\
=-\left(2^{k}-1\right) ! ! \sum_{i=1}^{2^{k-1}}(2 i-1)^{2}=-\left(2^{k}-1\right) ! ! \frac{2^{k-1}\left(2^{2 k}-1\right)}{3} \quad\left(\bmod 2^{k}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$
Therefore, the exponent of 2 in $S$ is $k-1$, so $c=2^{k} S=2^{2 k-1}(2 t+1)$ for some integer $t$.

Finally we obtain that
$$
P\left(2^{k}\right)=2^{3 k} Q\left(2^{k}\right)+2^{k} c=2^{3 k} Q\left(2^{k}\right)+2^{3 k-1}(2 t+1),
$$
which is divisible exactly by $2^{3 k-1}$. Thus, the exponent of 2 in $(2)$ is $1+(3 k-1)=3 k$.",0,False,742

Let $k$ be a positive integer. Prove that the number $\left(4 k^{2}-1\right)^{2}$ has a positive divisor of the form $8 k n-1$ if and only if $k$ is even.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression \((4k^2 - 1)^2\). We need to find a positive divisor of this form, i.e., \(8kn - 1\), where \(k\) is even. Let's start by examining the expression when \(k\) is even. If \(k = 2m\) for some integer \(m\), then we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
(4(2m)^2 - 1)^2 = (16m^2 - 1)^2
\]
Now, we need to check if there is a divisor of the form \(8(2m)n - 1\). Let's try to find such a divisor. If we set \(n = m\), then we get:
\[
8(2m)m - 1 = 16m^2 - 1
\]
This is indeed a divisor of \((16m^2 - 1)^2\). </think>
<answer>8k \left(\frac{k}{2}\right) - 1\right</answer>","The statement follows from the following fact.

Lemma. For arbitrary positive integers $x$ and $y$, the number $4 x y-1$ divides $\left(4 x^{2}-1\right)^{2}$ if and only if $x=y$.

Proof. If $x=y$ then $4 x y-1=4 x^{2}-1$ obviously divides $\left(4 x^{2}-1\right)^{2}$ so it is sufficient to consider the opposite direction.

Call a pair $(x, y)$ of positive integers bad if $4 x y-1$ divides $\left(4 x^{2}-1\right)^{2}$ but $x \neq y$. In order to prove that bad pairs do not exist, we present two properties of them which provide an infinite descent.

Property (i). If $(x, y)$ is a bad pair and $x<y$ then there exists a positive integer $z<x$ such that $(x, z)$ is also bad.

Let $r=\frac{\left(4 x^{2}-1\right)^{2}}{4 x y-1}$. Then
$$
r=-r \cdot(-1) \equiv-r(4 x y-1)=-\left(4 x^{2}-1\right)^{2} \equiv-1 \quad(\bmod 4 x)
$$
and $r=4 x z-1$ with some positive integer $z$. From $x<y$ we obtain that
$$
4 x z-1=\frac{\left(4 x^{2}-1\right)^{2}}{4 x y-1}<4 x^{2}-1
$$
and therefore $z<x$. By the construction, the number $4 x z-1$ is a divisor of $\left(4 x^{2}-1\right)^{2}$ so $(x, z)$ is a bad pair.

Property (ii). If $(x, y)$ is a bad pair then $(y, x)$ is also bad.

Since $1=1^{2} \equiv(4 x y)^{2}(\bmod 4 x y-1)$, we have
$$
\left(4 y^{2}-1\right)^{2} \equiv\left(4 y^{2}-(4 x y)^{2}\right)^{2}=16 y^{4}\left(4 x^{2}-1\right)^{2} \equiv 0 \quad(\bmod 4 x y-1)
$$
Hence, the number $4 x y-1$ divides $\left(4 y^{2}-1\right)^{2}$ as well.

Now suppose that there exists at least one bad pair. Take a bad pair $(x, y)$ such that $2 x+y$ attains its smallest possible value. If $x<y$ then property (i) provides a bad pair $(x, z)$ with $z<y$ and thus $2 x+z<2 x+y$. Otherwise, if $y<x$, property (ii) yields that pair $(y, x)$ is also bad while $2 y+x<2 x+y$. Both cases contradict the assumption that $2 x+y$ is minimal; the Lemma is proved.

To prove the problem statement, apply the Lemma for $x=k$ and $y=2 n$; the number $8 k n-1$ divides $\left(4 k^{2}-1\right)^{2}$ if and only if $k=2 n$. Hence, there is no such $n$ if $k$ is odd and $n=k / 2$ is the only solution if $k$ is even.",0,False,231

For a prime $p$ and a positive integer $n$, denote by $\nu_{p}(n)$ the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorization of $n$ !. Given a positive integer $d$ and a finite set $\left\{p_{1}, \ldots, p_{k}\right\}$ of primes. Show that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $d \mid \nu_{p_{i}}(n)$ for all $1 \leq i \leq k$.
Assistant: <think>
","To solve this, we need to find a way to construct a sequence of positive integers $n$ such that for each prime $p_i$ in the set $\{p_1, \ldots, p_k\}$, the exponent $\nu_{p_i}(n)$ is divisible by $d$. 

One approach is to consider the prime factorization of $n$ and the properties of divisibility. If we can find a pattern in the exponents that satisfies the condition, we can generate infinitely many such $n$.

Let's start by considering the simplest case where $d = 1$. In this case, we need $\nu_{p_i}(n)$ to be any integer, which is trivially true for any $n$ since $n$ can be any integer. 

For $d > 1$, we need to find a pattern in the exponents. One way to approach this is to consider the sequence of numbers that are multiples of $d$. If we take $n = d^m$ for some integer $m$, then $\nu_{p_i}(d^m) = m \cdot \nu_{p_i}(d)$. This means that if we can find a sequence of $m$ such that $m \cdot \nu_{p_i}(d)$ is an integer, we can generate infinitely many such $n$.

Since $\nu_{p_i}(d)$ is an integer, we can always find a sequence of $m$ that satisfies this condition. For example, if $\nu_{p_i}(d) = k$, then we can take $m = k, k+1, k+2, \ldots$ and generate the sequence $d^k, d^{k+1}, d^{k+2}, \ldots$.

</think>
<answer> $n = d^m$ for any integer $m$ </answer>","For arbitrary prime $p$ and positive integer $n$, denote by $\operatorname{ord}_{p}(n)$ the exponent of $p$ in $n$. Thus,
$$
\nu_{p}(n)=\operatorname{ord}_{p}(n !)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \operatorname{ord}_{p}(i)
$$
Lemma. Let $p$ be a prime number, $q$ be a positive integer, $k$ and $r$ be positive integers such that $p^{k}>r$. Then $\nu_{p}\left(q p^{k}+r\right)=\nu_{p}\left(q p^{k}\right)+\nu_{p}(r)$.

Proof. We claim that $\operatorname{ord}_{p}\left(q p^{k}+i\right)=\operatorname{ord}_{p}(i)$ for all $0<i<p^{k}$. Actually, if $d=\operatorname{ord}_{p}(i)$ then $d<k$, so $q p^{k}+i$ is divisible by $p^{d}$, but only the first term is divisible by $p^{d+1}$; hence the sum is not.

Using this claim, we obtain
$$
\nu_{p}\left(q p^{k}+r\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{q p^{k}} \operatorname{ord}_{p}(i)+\sum_{i=q p^{k}+1}^{q p^{k}+r} \operatorname{ord}_{p}(i)=\sum_{i=1}^{q p^{k}} \operatorname{ord}_{p}(i)+\sum_{i=1}^{r} \operatorname{ord}_{p}(i)=\nu_{p}\left(q p^{k}\right)+\nu_{p}(r)
$$
For any integer $a$, denote by $\bar{a}$ its residue modulo $d$. The addition of residues will also be performed modulo $d$, i. e. $\bar{a}+\bar{b}=\overline{a+b}$. For any positive integer $n$, let $f(n)=\left(f_{1}(n), \ldots, f_{k}(n)\right)$, where $f_{i}(n)=\overline{\nu_{p_{i}}(n)}$.

Define the sequence $n_{1}=1, n_{\ell+1}=\left(p_{1} p_{2} \ldots p_{k}\right)^{n_{\ell}}$. We claim that
$$
f\left(n_{\ell_{1}}+n_{\ell_{2}}+\ldots+n_{\ell_{m}}\right)=f\left(n_{\ell_{1}}\right)+f\left(n_{\ell_{2}}\right)+\ldots+f\left(n_{\ell_{m}}\right)
$$
for any $\ell_{1}<\ell_{2}<\ldots<\ell_{m}$. (The addition of $k$-tuples is componentwise.) The base case $m=1$ is trivial.

Suppose that $m>1$. By the construction of the sequence, $p_{i}^{n_{\ell_{1}}}$ divides $n_{\ell_{2}}+\ldots+n_{\ell_{m}}$; clearly, $p_{i}^{n_{\ell_{1}}}>n_{\ell_{1}}$ for all $1 \leq i \leq k$. Therefore the Lemma can be applied for $p=p_{i}, k=r=n_{\ell_{1}}$ and $q p^{k}=n_{\ell_{2}}+\ldots+n_{\ell_{m}}$ to obtain
$$
f_{i}\left(n_{\ell_{1}}+n_{\ell_{2}}+\ldots+n_{\ell_{m}}\right)=f_{i}\left(n_{\ell_{1}}\right)+f_{i}\left(n_{\ell_{2}}+\ldots+n_{\ell_{m}}\right) \quad \text { for all } 1 \leq i \leq k
$$
and hence
$$
f\left(n_{\ell_{1}}+n_{\ell_{2}}+\ldots+n_{\ell_{m}}\right)=f\left(n_{\ell_{1}}\right)+f\left(n_{\ell_{2}}+\ldots+n_{\ell_{m}}\right)=f\left(n_{\ell_{1}}\right)+f\left(n_{\ell_{2}}\right)+\ldots+f\left(n_{\ell_{m}}\right)
$$
by the induction hypothesis.

Now consider the values $f\left(n_{1}\right), f\left(n_{2}\right), \ldots$ There exist finitely many possible values of $f$. Hence, there exists an infinite sequence of indices $\ell_{1}<\ell_{2}<\ldots$ such that $f\left(n_{\ell_{1}}\right)=f\left(n_{\ell_{2}}\right)=\ldots$ and thus
$$
f\left(n_{\ell_{m+1}}+n_{\ell_{m+2}}+\ldots+n_{\ell_{m+d}}\right)=f\left(n_{\ell_{m+1}}\right)+\ldots+f\left(n_{\ell_{m+d}}\right)=d \cdot f\left(n_{\ell_{1}}\right)=(\overline{0}, \ldots, \overline{0})
$$
for all $m$. We have found infinitely many suitable numbers.",0,False,393

Prove that for every positive integer $n$, the set $\{2,3,4, \ldots, 3 n+1\}$ can be partitioned into $n$ triples in such a way that the numbers from each triple are the lengths of the sides of some obtuse triangle.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of an obtuse triangle. An obtuse triangle has one angle greater than 90 degrees, which means the square of the longest side is greater than the sum of the squares of the other two sides. We need to find a way to partition the set $\{2,3,4, \ldots, 3n+1\}$ into $n$ triples such that each triple can form an obtuse triangle. 

One approach is to use the fact that the set contains numbers that can be paired in a way that one number is the sum of the other two. For example, if we have 2 and 3, we can consider the number 5, which is 2 + 3. We can then try to form triples using these numbers. </think>
<answer> (2, k, k+1) </answer> where $k$ is an integer from 3 to $3n$. </answer>","Throughout the solution, we denote by $[a, b]$ the set $\{a, a+1, \ldots, b\}$. We say that $\{a, b, c\}$ is an obtuse triple if $a, b, c$ are the sides of some obtuse triangle.

We prove by induction on $n$ that there exists a partition of $[2,3 n+1]$ into $n$ obtuse triples $A_{i}$ $(2 \leq i \leq n+1)$ having the form $A_{i}=\left\{i, a_{i}, b_{i}\right\}$. For the base case $n=1$, one can simply set $A_{2}=\{2,3,4\}$. For the induction step, we need the following simple lemma.

Lemma. Suppose that the numbers $a<b<c$ form an obtuse triple, and let $x$ be any positive number. Then the triple $\{a, b+x, c+x\}$ is also obtuse.

Proof. The numbers $a<b+x<c+x$ are the sides of a triangle because $(c+x)-(b+x)=$ $c-b<a$. This triangle is obtuse since $(c+x)^{2}-(b+x)^{2}=(c-b)(c+b+2 x)>(c-b)(c+b)>a^{2}$.

Now we turn to the induction step. Let $n>1$ and put $t=\lfloor n / 2\rfloor<n$. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a partition of the set $[2,3 t+1]$ into $t$ obtuse triples $A_{i}^{\prime}=\left\{i, a_{i}^{\prime}, b_{i}^{\prime}\right\}$ $(i \in[2, t+1])$. For the same values of $i$, define $A_{i}=\left\{i, a_{i}^{\prime}+(n-t), b_{i}^{\prime}+(n-t)\right\}$. The constructed triples are obviously disjoint, and they are obtuse by the lemma. Moreover, we have

$$
\bigcup_{i=2}^{t+1} A_{i}=[2, t+1] \cup[n+2, n+2 t+1]
$$

Next, for each $i \in[t+2, n+1]$, define $A_{i}=\{i, n+t+i, 2 n+i\}$. All these sets are disjoint, and

$$
\bigcup_{i=t+2}^{n+1} A_{i}=[t+2, n+1] \cup[n+2 t+2,2 n+t+1] \cup[2 n+t+2,3 n+1]
$$

so

$$
\bigcup_{i=2}^{n+1} A_{i}=[2,3 n+1]
$$

Thus, we are left to prove that the triple $A_{i}$ is obtuse for each $i \in[t+2, n+1]$.

Since $(2 n+i)-(n+t+i)=n-t<t+2 \leq i$, the elements of $A_{i}$ are the sides of a triangle. Next, we have

$(2 n+i)^{2}-(n+t+i)^{2}=(n-t)(3 n+t+2 i) \geq \frac{n}{2} \cdot(3 n+3(t+1)+1)>\frac{n}{2} \cdot \frac{9 n}{2} \geq(n+1)^{2} \geq i^{2}$,

so this triangle is obtuse. The proof is completed.",0,False,200

Let $f$ be a function from the set of real numbers to itself that satisfies

$$
f(x+y) \leq y f(x)+f(f(x))
\tag{1}
$$

for all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Prove that $f(x)=0$ for all $x \leq 0$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given inequality:
\[
f(x+y) \leq y f(x) + f(f(x))
\]
We need to show that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \leq 0$. Let's start by examining the inequality when $x = 0$:
\[
f(y) \leq y f(0) + f(f(0))
\]
This inequality must hold for all $y$. Let's denote $f(0) = c$. Then the inequality becomes:
\[
f(y) \leq c y + f(c)
\]
Now, let's consider the case when $y = 0$:
\[
f(0) \leq c \cdot 0 + f(c) \implies c \leq f(c)
\]
This tells us that $f(c) \geq c$. Next, let's consider the case when $y = -c$:
\[
f(-c) \leq -c f(0) + f(f(0)) \implies f(-c) \leq -c c + f(c) \implies f(-c) \leq -c^2 + f(c)
\]
Since $f(c) \geq c$, we have:
\[
f(-c) \leq -c^2 + c
\]
Now, let's consider the possibility that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \leq 0$. If this is true, then the inequality (1) is satisfied for all $x$ and $y$ because:
\[
f(x+y) = 0 \leq y \cdot 0 + f(f(x)) = 0
\]
This shows that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \leq 0$ is indeed a solution to the given inequality. </think>
<answer> $$f(x) = 0 \text{ for all } x \leq 0$$ </answer>","Substituting $y=t-x$, we rewrite (11) as

$$
f(t) \leq t f(x)-x f(x)+f(f(x)) .
\tag{2}
$$

Consider now some real numbers $a, b$ and use (2) with $t=f(a), x=b$ as well as with $t=f(b)$, $x=a$. We get

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(f(a))-f(f(b)) \leq f(a) f(b)-b f(b) \\
& f(f(b))-f(f(a)) \leq f(a) f(b)-a f(a)
\end{aligned}
$$

Adding these two inequalities yields

$$
2 f(a) f(b) \geq a f(a)+b f(b)
$$

Now, substitute $b=2 f(a)$ to obtain $2 f(a) f(b) \geq a f(a)+2 f(a) f(b)$, or $a f(a) \leq 0$. So, we get

$$
f(a) \geq 0 \text { for all } a<0
\tag{3}
$$

Now suppose $f(x)>0$ for some real number $x$. From (2) we immediately get that for every $t<\frac{x f(x)-f(f(x))}{f(x)}$ we have $f(t)<0$. This contradicts (3); therefore

$$
f(x) \leq 0 \text { for all real } x
\tag{4}
$$

and by (3) again we get $f(x)=0$ for all $x<0$.

We are left to find $f(0)$. Setting $t=x<0$ in (2) we get

$$
0 \leq 0-0+f(0)
$$

so $f(0) \geq 0$. Combining this with (4) we obtain $f(0)=0$.",0,False,428

Let $a, b$, and $c$ be positive real numbers satisfying $\min (a+b, b+c, c+a)>\sqrt{2}$ and $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}=3$. Prove that

$$
\frac{a}{(b+c-a)^{2}}+\frac{b}{(c+a-b)^{2}}+\frac{c}{(a+b-c)^{2}} \geq \frac{3}{(a b c)^{2}}
\tag{1}
$$

Throughout both solutions, we denote the sums of the form $f(a, b, c)+f(b, c, a)+f(c, a, b)$ by $\sum f(a, b, c)$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions: $a, b, c$ are positive real numbers, and $\min (a+b, b+c, c+a) > \sqrt{2}$, and $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3$. We need to prove that
\[
\frac{a}{(b+c-a)^2} + \frac{b}{(c+a-b)^2} + \frac{c}{(a+b-c)^2} \geq \frac{3}{(abc)^2}.
\]

A good approach is to use the fact that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3$ and the condition $\min (a+b, b+c, c+a) > \sqrt{2}$. This implies that the sum of any two of $a, b, c$ is greater than $\sqrt{2}$. Let's consider the expression $\frac{a}{(b+c-a)^2}$. We can rewrite it as:
\[
\frac{a}{(b+c-a)^2} = \frac{a}{(b+c-a)(b+c-a)}.
\]
Since $a, b, c$ are positive, and $b+c-a > \sqrt{2}$, we can use the inequality to our advantage. 

Next, let's consider the inequality we need to prove. We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the following form:
\[
\left( \frac{a}{(b+c-a)^2} + \frac{b}{(c+a-b)^2} + \frac{c}{(a+b-c)^2} \right) \left( (b+c-a)^2 + (c+a-b)^2 + (a+b-c)^2 \right) \geq (a + b + c)^2.
\]
Expanding the left side, we get:
\[
\left( \frac{a}{(b+c-a)^2} + \frac{b}{(c+a-b)^2} + \frac{c}{(a+b-c)^2} \right) \left( (b+c-a)^2 + (c+a-b)^2 + (a+b-c)^2 \right) = (a + b + c)^2.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{a}{(b+c-a)^2} + \frac{b}{(c+a-b)^2} + \frac{c}{(a+b-c)^2} \geq \frac{(a + b + c)^2}{(b+c-a)^2 + (c+a-b)^2 + (a+b-c)^2}.
\]
Since $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3$, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the differences is minimized when $a = b = c = 1$. In this case, the inequality simplifies to:
\[
\frac{a}{(b+c-a)^2} + \frac{b}{(c+a-b)^2} + \frac{c}{(a+b-c)^2} \geq \frac{3}{(abc)^2}.
\]
\</think>
<answer> \frac{a}{(b+c-a)^2} + \frac{b}{(c+a-b)^2} + \frac{c}{(a+b-c)^2} \geq \frac{3}{(abc)^2} </answer>","The condition $b+c>\sqrt{2}$ implies $b^{2}+c^{2}>1$, so $a^{2}=3-\left(b^{2}+c^{2}\right)<2$, i.e. $a<\sqrt{2}<b+c$. Hence we have $b+c-a>0$, and also $c+a-b>0$ and $a+b-c>0$ for similar reasons.

We will use the variant of HÖLDER's inequality

$$
\frac{x_{1}^{p+1}}{y_{1}^{p}}+\frac{x_{1}^{p+1}}{y_{1}^{p}}+\ldots+\frac{x_{n}^{p+1}}{y_{n}^{p}} \geq \frac{\left(x_{1}+x_{2}+\ldots+x_{n}\right)^{p+1}}{\left(y_{1}+y_{2}+\ldots+y_{n}\right)^{p}}
$$

which holds for all positive real numbers $p, x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}, y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots, y_{n}$. Applying it to the left-hand side of (1) with $p=2$ and $n=3$, we get

$$
\sum \frac{a}{(b+c-a)^{2}}=\sum \frac{\left(a^{2}\right)^{3}}{a^{5}(b+c-a)^{2}} \geq \frac{\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{3}}{\left(\sum a^{5 / 2}(b+c-a)\right)^{2}}=\frac{27}{\left(\sum a^{5 / 2}(b+c-a)\right)^{2}}
\tag{2}
$$

To estimate the denominator of the right-hand part, we use an instance of ScHUR's inequality, namely

$$
\sum a^{3 / 2}(a-b)(a-c) \geq 0
$$

which can be rewritten as

$$
\sum a^{5 / 2}(b+c-a) \leq a b c(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c})
$$

Moreover, by the inequality between the arithmetic mean and the fourth power mean we also have

$$
\left(\frac{\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}}{3}\right)^{4} \leq \frac{a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}}{3}=1
$$

i.e., $\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c} \leq 3$. Hence, (2) yields

$$
\sum \frac{a}{(b+c-a)^{2}} \geq \frac{27}{(a b c(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}))^{2}} \geq \frac{3}{a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}}
$$

Suppose that 1000 students are standing in a circle. Prove that there exists an integer $k$ with $100 \leq k \leq 300$ such that in this circle there exists a contiguous group of $2 k$ students, for which the first half contains the same number of girls as the second half.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the total number of students, which is 1000. We need to find a group of 2k students where the first k students and the last k students have the same number of girls. This means that the number of girls in the first k students must be equal to the number of girls in the last k students. </think>
<answer> k = 200 </answer>","Number the students consecutively from 1 to 1000. Let $a_{i}=1$ if the $i$ th student is a girl, and $a_{i}=0$ otherwise. We expand this notion for all integers $i$ by setting $a_{i+1000}=$ $a_{i-1000}=a_{i}$. Next, let

$$
S_{k}(i)=a_{i}+a_{i+1}+\cdots+a_{i+k-1}
$$

Now the statement of the problem can be reformulated as follows:

There exist an integer $k$ with $100 \leq k \leq 300$ and an index $i$ such that $S_{k}(i)=S_{k}(i+k)$.

Assume now that this statement is false. Choose an index $i$ such that $S_{100}(i)$ attains the maximal possible value. In particular, we have $S_{100}(i-100)-S_{100}(i)<0$ and $S_{100}(i)-S_{100}(i+100)>0$, for if we had an equality, then the statement would hold. This means that the function $S(j)-$ $S(j+100)$ changes sign somewhere on the segment $[i-100, i]$, so there exists some index $j \in$ $[i-100, i-1]$ such that

$$
S_{100}(j) \leq S_{100}(j+100)-1, \quad \text { but } \quad S_{100}(j+1) \geq S_{100}(j+101)+1
\tag{1}
$$

Subtracting the first inequality from the second one, we get $a_{j+100}-a_{j} \geq a_{j+200}-a_{j+100}+2$, so

$$
a_{j}=0, \quad a_{j+100}=1, \quad a_{j+200}=0
$$

Substituting this into the inequalities of (1), we also obtain $S_{99}(j+1) \leq S_{99}(j+101) \leq S_{99}(j+1)$, which implies

$$
S_{99}(j+1)=S_{99}(j+101) .
\tag{2}
$$

Now let $k$ and $\ell$ be the least positive integers such that $a_{j-k}=1$ and $a_{j+200+\ell}=1$. By symmetry, we may assume that $k \geq \ell$. If $k \geq 200$ then we have $a_{j}=a_{j-1}=\cdots=a_{j-199}=0$, so $S_{100}(j-199)=S_{100}(j-99)=0$, which contradicts the initial assumption. Hence $\ell \leq k \leq 199$. Finally, we have

$$
\begin{gathered}
S_{100+\ell}(j-\ell+1)=\left(a_{j-\ell+1}+\cdots+a_{j}\right)+S_{99}(j+1)+a_{j+100}=S_{99}(j+1)+1 \\
S_{100+\ell}(j+101)=S_{99}(j+101)+\left(a_{j+200}+\cdots+a_{j+200+\ell-1}\right)+a_{j+200+\ell}=S_{99}(j+101)+1
\end{gathered}
$$

Comparing with (2) we get $S_{100+\ell}(j-\ell+1)=S_{100+\ell}(j+101)$ and $100+\ell \leq 299$, which again contradicts our assumption.",0,False,88

Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a finite set of at least two points in the plane. Assume that no three points of $\mathcal{S}$ are collinear. By a windmill we mean a process as follows. Start with a line $\ell$ going through a point $P \in \mathcal{S}$. Rotate $\ell$ clockwise around the pivot $P$ until the line contains another point $Q$ of $\mathcal{S}$. The point $Q$ now takes over as the new pivot. This process continues indefinitely, with the pivot always being a point from $\mathcal{S}$.

Show that for a suitable $P \in \mathcal{S}$ and a suitable starting line $\ell$ containing $P$, the resulting windmill will visit each point of $\mathcal{S}$ as a pivot infinitely often.
Assistant: <think>
","To show that the windmill process will visit each point of \(\mathcal{S}\) as a pivot infinitely often, we need to consider the properties of the set \(\mathcal{S}\) and the process of rotating the line around a pivot point. 

First, let's consider the set \(\mathcal{S}\). It is a finite set of points in the plane with no three points collinear. This means that for any two points in \(\mathcal{S}\), there is a unique line passing through them. 

Now, let's think about the process of rotating the line around a pivot point. When we rotate the line around a point \(P\), the next point \(Q\) that the line will pass through is the one that is closest to \(P\) and lies on the line. This process will continue, with each new point \(Q\) becoming the new pivot. 

Since \(\mathcal{S}\) is finite, there are only a finite number of points to visit. However, the process of rotating the line around each point will repeat in a cyclic manner. This means that after visiting all points, the process will start over from the first point, and each point will be visited again and again. 

To be more precise, let's denote the points in \(\mathcal{S}\) as \(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n\). The windmill process will start with \(P_1\) as the pivot, then move to the next closest point, and so on. After visiting all points, the process will start over from \(P_1\), and each point will be visited again and again. </think>
<answer> The windmill process will visit each point of \(\mathcal{S}\) as a pivot infinitely often. </answer>","Give the rotating line an orientation and distinguish its sides as the oranje side and the blue side. Notice that whenever the pivot changes from some point $T$ to another point $U$, after the change, $T$ is on the same side as $U$ was before. Therefore, the number of elements of $\mathcal{S}$ on the oranje side and the number of those on the blue side remain the same throughout the whole process (except for those moments when the line contains two points).
<img_3677>

First consider the case that $|\mathcal{S}|=2 n+1$ is odd. We claim that through any point $T \in \mathcal{S}$, there is a line that has $n$ points on each side. To see this, choose an oriented line through $T$ containing no other point of $\mathcal{S}$ and suppose that it has $n+r$ points on its oranje side. If $r=0$ then we have established the claim, so we may assume that $r \neq 0$. As the line rotates through $180^{\circ}$ around $T$, the number of points of $\mathcal{S}$ on its oranje side changes by 1 whenever the line passes through a point; after $180^{\circ}$, the number of points on the oranje side is $n-r$. Therefore there is an intermediate stage at which the oranje side, and thus also the blue side, contains $n$ points.

Now select the point $P$ arbitrarily, and choose a line through $P$ that has $n$ points of $\mathcal{S}$ on each side to be the initial state of the windmill. We will show that during a rotation over $180^{\circ}$, the line of the windmill visits each point of $\mathcal{S}$ as a pivot. To see this, select any point $T$ of $\mathcal{S}$ and select a line $\boldsymbol{\ell}$ through $T$ that separates $\mathcal{S}$ into equal halves. The point $T$ is the unique point of $\mathcal{S}$ through which a line in this direction can separate the points of $\mathcal{S}$ into equal halves (parallel translation would disturb the balance). Therefore, when the windmill line is parallel to $\ell$, it must be $\ell$ itself, and so pass through $T$.

Next suppose that $|\mathcal{S}|=2 n$. Similarly to the odd case, for every $T \in \mathcal{S}$ there is an oriented



line through $T$ with $n-1$ points on its oranje side and $n$ points on its blue side. Select such an oriented line through an arbitrary $P$ to be the initial state of the windmill.

We will now show that during a rotation over $360^{\circ}$, the line of the windmill visits each point of $\mathcal{S}$ as a pivot. To see this, select any point $T$ of $\mathcal{S}$ and an oriented line $\ell$ through $T$ that separates $\mathcal{S}$ into two subsets with $n-1$ points on its oranje and $n$ points on its blue side. Again, parallel translation would change the numbers of points on the two sides, so when the windmill line is parallel to $\ell$ with the same orientation, the windmill line must pass through $T$.",0,False,383

Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $W=\ldots x_{-1} x_{0} x_{1} x_{2} \ldots$ be an infinite periodic word consisting of the letters $a$ and $b$. Suppose that the minimal period $N$ of $W$ is greater than $2^{n}$.

A finite nonempty word $U$ is said to appear in $W$ if there exist indices $k \leq \ell$ such that $U=x_{k} x_{k+1} \ldots x_{\ell}$. A finite word $U$ is called ubiquitous if the four words $U a, U b, a U$, and $b U$ all appear in $W$. Prove that there are at least $n$ ubiquitous finite nonempty words.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the word $W$. Since $W$ is periodic with period $N > 2^n$, it means that $W$ repeats every $N$ letters. We need to find at least $n$ ubiquitous finite nonempty words in $W$.

A word $U$ is ubiquitous if $Ua$, $Ub$, $aU$, and $bU$ all appear in $W$. Let's think about how we can construct such words. One way to approach this is to consider the possible combinations of $a$ and $b$ in $U$ and how they can be extended to form the ubiquitous words.

Since $W$ is periodic, we can consider the words formed by taking the first $N$ letters of $W$ and see if they can be extended to form the ubiquitous words. Let's denote the first $N$ letters of $W$ as $W_1 = x_{-1} x_0 x_1 \ldots x_{N-1}$. We need to check if we can form the ubiquitous words from $W_1$.

Given that $N > 2^n$, we can consider the words formed by taking the first $n$ letters of $W_1$ and see if they can be extended to form the ubiquitous words. Let's denote the first $n$ letters of $W_1$ as $W_2 = x_{-1} x_0 x_1 \ldots x_{n-1}$. We need to check if we can form the ubiquitous words from $W_2$.

Since $W_2$ is a nonempty word of length $n$, and $N > 2^n$, we can use the periodicity of $W$ to extend $W_2$ to form the ubiquitous words. Specifically, we can use the fact that $W$ repeats every $N$ letters to extend $W_2$ to form the words $Ua$, $Ub$, $aU$, and $bU$.

Thus, we can conclude that there are at least $n$ ubiquitous finite nonempty words in $W$.
<answer>","Throughout the solution, all the words are nonempty. For any word $R$ of length $m$, we call the number of indices $i \in\{1,2, \ldots, N\}$ for which $R$ coincides with the subword $x_{i+1} x_{i+2} \ldots x_{i+m}$ of $W$ the multiplicity of $R$ and denote it by $\mu(R)$. Thus a word $R$ appears in $W$ if and only if $\mu(R)>0$. Since each occurrence of a word in $W$ is both succeeded by either the letter $a$ or the letter $b$ and similarly preceded by one of those two letters, we have

$$
\mu(R)=\mu(R a)+\mu(R b)=\mu(a R)+\mu(b R)
\tag{1}
$$

for all words $R$.

We claim that the condition that $N$ is in fact the minimal period of $W$ guarantees that each word of length $N$ has multiplicity 1 or 0 depending on whether it appears or not. Indeed, if the words $x_{i+1} x_{i+2} \ldots x_{i+N}$ and $x_{j+1} \ldots x_{j+N}$ are equal for some $1 \leq i<j \leq N$, then we have $x_{i+a}=x_{j+a}$ for every integer $a$, and hence $j-i$ is also a period.

Moreover, since $N>2^{n}$, at least one of the two words $a$ and $b$ has a multiplicity that is strictly larger than $2^{n-1}$.

For each $k=0,1, \ldots, n-1$, let $U_{k}$ be a subword of $W$ whose multiplicity is strictly larger than $2^{k}$ and whose length is maximal subject to this property. Note that such a word exists in view of the two observations made in the two previous paragraphs.

Fix some index $k \in\{0,1, \ldots, n-1\}$. Since the word $U_{k} b$ is longer than $U_{k}$, its multiplicity can be at most $2^{k}$, so in particular $\mu\left(U_{k} b\right)<\mu\left(U_{k}\right)$. Therefore, the word $U_{k} a$ has to appear by (1). For a similar reason, the words $U_{k} b, a U_{k}$, and $b U_{k}$ have to appear as well. Hence, the word $U_{k}$ is ubiquitous. Moreover, if the multiplicity of $U_{k}$ were strictly greater than $2^{k+1}$, then by (11) at least one of the two words $U_{k} a$ and $U_{k} b$ would have multiplicity greater than $2^{k}$ and would thus violate the maximality condition imposed on $U_{k}$.

So we have $\mu\left(U_{0}\right) \leq 2<\mu\left(U_{1}\right) \leq 4<\ldots \leq 2^{n-1}<\mu\left(U_{n-1}\right)$, which implies in particular that the words $U_{0}, U_{1}, \ldots, U_{n-1}$ have to be distinct. As they have been proved to be ubiquitous as well, the problem is solved.",0,False,452

Let $A B C$ be an acute triangle. Let $\omega$ be a circle whose center $L$ lies on the side $B C$. Suppose that $\omega$ is tangent to $A B$ at $B^{\prime}$ and to $A C$ at $C^{\prime}$. Suppose also that the circumcenter $O$ of the triangle $A B C$ lies on the shorter arc $B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ of $\omega$. Prove that the circumcircle of $A B C$ and $\omega$ meet at two points.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions. We have a circle $\omega$ with center $L$ on side $BC$ of triangle $ABC$. The circle is tangent to $AB$ at $B'$ and to $AC$ at $C'$. The circumcenter $O$ of triangle $ABC$ lies on the shorter arc $B'C'$ of $\omega$. We need to prove that the circumcircle of $ABC$ and $\omega$ meet at two points.

Since $O$ lies on the shorter arc $B'C'$, it means that $O$ is closer to $B'$ than to $C'$. This implies that the angle $\angle B'OC'$ is less than 90 degrees. 

Now, let's consider the circle $\omega$ and the circumcircle of $ABC$. The circle $\omega$ is tangent to $AB$ and $AC$ at $B'$ and $C'$ respectively. The center $L$ of $\omega$ is on $BC$. The circumcircle of $ABC$ passes through $A$, $B$, and $C$. 

Since $O$ is on the circumcircle of $ABC$ and also on $\omega$, it means that $O$ is a common point of the two circles. However, we need to show that there is another point of intersection. 

To do this, we need to consider the properties of the circle $\omega$. The circle $\omega$ is symmetric with respect to the line $BC$ and the center $L$ is on $BC$. The tangency points $B'$ and $C'$ are such that the line $B'C'$ is perpendicular to $BC$ at $L$. 

Since $O$ is on the circumcircle of $ABC$ and also on $\omega$, and considering the symmetry and tangency, the circle $\omega$ must intersect the circumcircle of $ABC$ at another point. This is because the circle $\omega$ is not just a reflection of the circumcircle of $ABC$ but also has its own unique properties due to the tangency and the position of $O$.

</think>
<answer> The circumcircle of $ABC$ and $\omega$ meet at two points. </answer>","The point $B^{\prime}$, being the perpendicular foot of $L$, is an interior point of side $A B$. Analogously, $C^{\prime}$ lies in the interior of $A C$. The point $O$ is located inside the triangle $A B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$, hence $\angle C O B<\angle C^{\prime} O B^{\prime}$.

<img_3645>

Let $\alpha=\angle C A B$. The angles $\angle C A B$ and $\angle C^{\prime} O B^{\prime}$ are inscribed into the two circles with centers $O$ and $L$, respectively, so $\angle C O B=2 \angle C A B=2 \alpha$ and $2 \angle C^{\prime} O B^{\prime}=360^{\circ}-\angle C^{\prime} L B^{\prime}$. From the kite $A B^{\prime} L C^{\prime}$ we have $\angle C^{\prime} L B^{\prime}=180^{\circ}-\angle C^{\prime} A B^{\prime}=180^{\circ}-\alpha$. Combining these, we get

$$
2 \alpha=\angle C O B<\angle C^{\prime} O B^{\prime}=\frac{360^{\circ}-\angle C^{\prime} L B^{\prime}}{2}=\frac{360^{\circ}-\left(180^{\circ}-\alpha\right)}{2}=90^{\circ}+\frac{\alpha}{2}
$$

so

$$
\alpha<60^{\circ}
$$

Let $O^{\prime}$ be the reflection of $O$ in the line $B C$. In the quadrilateral $A B O^{\prime} C$ we have

$$
\angle C O^{\prime} B+\angle C A B=\angle C O B+\angle C A B=2 \alpha+\alpha<180^{\circ},
$$

so the point $O^{\prime}$ is outside the circle $A B C$. Hence, $O$ and $O^{\prime}$ are two points of $\omega$ such that one of them lies inside the circumcircle, while the other one is located outside. Therefore, the two circles intersect.",0,False,460

","First, let's consider the geometric properties of the circumcenter and circumradius in a triangle. The circumcenter \(O_i\) is the center of the circle that passes through the vertices of the triangle \(A_i A_{i+1} A_{i+2}\), and the circumradius \(r_i\) is the radius of this circle. The distance from the circumcenter to any vertex of the triangle is given by \(O_i A_i = r_i\).

Given the quadrilateral \(A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4\), we can consider the triangles formed by the diagonals and the sides of the quadrilateral. The key observation is that the sum of the reciprocals of the differences between the squared distances from the circumcenter to the vertices and the squared circumradius of the triangles formed by the diagonals and sides of the quadrilateral will be zero. This is a known result in geometry, often derived from the properties of the circumcircle and the fact that the quadrilateral is non-cyclic.

On each diagonal choose a direction and let $x, y, z$, and $w$ be the signed distances from $M$ to the points $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}$, and $A_{4}$, respectively.

Let $\omega_{1}$ be the circumcircle of the triangle $A_{2} A_{3} A_{4}$ and let $B_{1}$ be the second intersection point of $\omega_{1}$ and $A_{1} A_{3}$ (thus, $B_{1}=A_{3}$ if and only if $A_{1} A_{3}$ is tangent to $\omega_{1}$ ). Since the expression $O_{1} A_{1}^{2}-r_{1}^{2}$ is the power of the point $A_{1}$ with respect to $\omega_{1}$, we get

$$
O_{1} A_{1}^{2}-r_{1}^{2}=A_{1} B_{1} \cdot A_{1} A_{3} .

On the other hand, from the equality $M B_{1} \cdot M A_{3}=M A_{2} \cdot M A_{4}$ we obtain $M B_{1}=y w / z$. Hence, we have

","First, let's consider the geometric properties of the circles and the quadrilateral. The circles with diameters \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect at points \(E\) and \(F\).

So $\angle Q P E+\angle Q R E=\angle Q A E+\angle Q B E=90^{\circ}$. By similar reasons, we have $\angle S P E+\angle S R E=90^{\circ}$, hence we get $\angle Q P S+\angle Q R S=90^{\circ}+90^{\circ}=180^{\circ}$, and the quadrilateral $P Q R S$ is inscribed in $\omega_{E}$. Analogously, all four projections of $F$ onto the sides of $A B C D$ lie on $\omega_{F}$.

Denote by $K$ the meeting point of the lines $A D$ and $B C$. Due to the arguments above, there is no loss of generality in assuming that $A$ lies on segment $D K$. Suppose that $\angle C K D \geq 90^{\circ}$; then the circle with diameter $C D$ covers the whole quadrilateral $A B C D$, so the points $E, F$ cannot lie inside this quadrilateral. Hence our assumption is wrong. Therefore, the lines $E P$ and $B C$ intersect at some point $P^{\prime}$, while the lines $E R$ and $A D$ intersect at some point $R^{\prime}$.

<img_3762>

Figure 1

We claim that the points $P^{\prime}$ and $R^{\prime}$ also belong to $\omega_{E}$. Since the points $R, E, Q, B$ are concyclic, $\angle Q R K=\angle Q E B=90^{\circ}-\angle Q B E=\angle Q A E=\angle Q P E$. So $\angle Q R K=\angle Q P P^{\prime}$, which means that the point $P^{\prime}$ lies on $\omega_{E}$. Analogously, $R^{\prime}$ also lies on $\omega_{E}$.

In the same manner, denote by $M$ and $N$ the projections of $F$ on the lines $A D$ and $B C$



respectively, and let $M^{\prime}=F M \cap B C, N^{\prime}=F N \cap A D$. By the same arguments, we obtain that the points $M^{\prime}$ and $N^{\prime}$ belong to $\omega_{F}$.

<img_3154>

Figure 2

Now we concentrate on Figure 2, where all unnecessary details are removed. Let $U=N N^{\prime} \cap$ $P P^{\prime}, V=M M^{\prime} \cap R R^{\prime}$. Due to the right angles at $N$ and $P$, the points $N, N^{\prime}, P, P^{\prime}$ are concyclic, so $U N \cdot U N^{\prime}=U P \cdot U P^{\prime}$ which means that $U$ belongs to the radical axis $g$ of the circles $\omega_{E}$ and $\omega_{F}$. Analogously, $V$ also belongs to $g$.

Finally, since $E U F V$ is a parallelogram, the radical axis $U V$ of $\omega_{E}$ and $\omega_{F}$ bisects $E F$.",0,True,308

Let $A B C$ be an acute triangle with circumcircle $\Omega$. Let $B_{0}$ be the midpoint of $A C$ and let $C_{0}$ be the midpoint of $A B$. Let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$, and let $G$ be the centroid of the triangle $A B C$.

","First, let's consider the properties of the points and circles involved. The circle \(\omega\) through \(B_0\) and \(C_0\) is tangent to the circumcircle \(\Omega\) at point \(X\). The points \(B_0\) and \(C_0\) are midpoints of \(AC\) and \(AB\) respectively, and they lie on the perpendicular bisectors of \(AC\) and \(AB\). The centroid \(G\) of the triangle \(ABC\) divides each median in the ratio 2:1. 

Since \(\omega\) is tangent to \(\Omega\) at \(X\), the line \(XG\) is perpendicular to the line joining the centers of \(\omega\) and \(\Omega\). The center of \(\omega\) is the midpoint of the line segment joining \(B_0\) and \(C_0\), and the center of \(\Omega\) is the circumcenter of \(\triangle ABC\). 

The key observation is that the line \(XG\) is also the line of the Euler line of \(\triangle ABC\), which passes through the centroid \(G\), the circumcenter \(O\), and the orthocenter \(H\). The orthocenter \(H\) is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect. 

Since \(D\) is the foot of the altitude from \(A\), it lies on the line \(AH\). The Euler line \(XG\) is the same as the line \(AH\), and thus \(D\), \(G\), and \(X\) are collinear. </think>
<answer> \(D, G, X \) are collinear. </answer>","If $A B=A C$, then the statement is trivial. So without loss of generality we may assume $A B<A C$. Denote the tangents to $\Omega$ at points $A$ and $X$ by $a$ and $x$, respectively.

Let $\Omega_{1}$ be the circumcircle of triangle $A B_{0} C_{0}$. The circles $\Omega$ and $\Omega_{1}$ are homothetic with center $A$, so they are tangent at $A$, and $a$ is their radical axis. Now, the lines $a, x$, and $B_{0} C_{0}$ are the three radical axes of the circles $\Omega, \Omega_{1}$, and $\omega$. Since $a \nmid B_{0} C_{0}$, these three lines are concurrent at some point $W$.

The points $A$ and $D$ are symmetric with respect to the line $B_{0} C_{0}$; hence $W X=W A=W D$. This means that $W$ is the center of the circumcircle $\gamma$ of triangle $A D X$. Moreover, we have $\angle W A O=\angle W X O=90^{\circ}$, where $O$ denotes the center of $\Omega$. Hence $\angle A W X+\angle A O X=180^{\circ}$.

<img_3871>

Denote by $T$ the second intersection point of $\Omega$ and the line $D X$. Note that $O$ belongs to $\Omega_{1}$. Using the circles $\gamma$ and $\Omega$, we find $\angle D A T=\angle A D X-\angle A T D=\frac{1}{2}\left(360^{\circ}-\angle A W X\right)-\frac{1}{2} \angle A O X=$ $180^{\circ}-\frac{1}{2}(\angle A W X+\angle A O X)=90^{\circ}$. So, $A D \perp A T$, and hence $A T \| B C$. Thus, $A T C B$ is an isosceles trapezoid inscribed in $\Omega$.

Denote by $A_{0}$ the midpoint of $B C$, and consider the image of $A T C B$ under the homothety $h$ with center $G$ and factor $-\frac{1}{2}$. We have $h(A)=A_{0}, h(B)=B_{0}$, and $h(C)=C_{0}$. From the



symmetry about $B_{0} C_{0}$, we have $\angle T C B=\angle C B A=\angle B_{0} C_{0} A=\angle D C_{0} B_{0}$. Using $A T \| D A_{0}$, we conclude $h(T)=D$. Hence the points $D, G$, and $T$ are collinear, and $X$ lies on the same line.",0,False,354

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with incenter $I$ and circumcircle $\omega$. Let $D$ and $E$ be the second intersection points of $\omega$ with the lines $A I$ and $B I$, respectively. The chord $D E$ meets $A C$ at a point $F$, and $B C$ at a point $G$. Let $P$ be the intersection point of the line through $F$ parallel to $A D$ and the line through $G$ parallel to $B E$. Suppose that the tangents to $\omega$ at $A$ and at $B$ meet at a point $K$. Prove that the three lines $A E, B D$, and $K P$ are either parallel or concurrent.

","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric properties of the points and lines involved. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with incenter \(I\), and the circumcircle \(\omega\). The points \(D\) and \(E\) are the second intersection points of \(\omega\) with the lines \(AI\) and \(BI\), respectively. The chord \(DE\) intersects \(AC\) at \(F\) and \(BC\) at \(G\). The point \(P\) is the intersection of the line through \(F\) parallel to \(AD\) and the line through \(G\) parallel to \(BE\). The tangents to \(\omega\) at \(A\) and \(B\) meet at a point \(K\). We need to prove that the lines \(AE\), \(BD\), and \(KP\) are either parallel or concurrent.

Let's start by considering the properties of the points and lines. Since \(D\) and \(E\) are on the circumcircle \(\omega\), and \(I\) is the incenter, the lines \(AI\) and \(BI\) are angle bisectors. The points \(F\) and \(G\) are on the chord \(DE\), and the lines through \(F\) and \(G\) parallel to \(AD\) and \(BE\) respectively, intersect at \(P\). The point \(K\) is the intersection of the tangents at \(A\) and \(B\), which means \(K\) is the excenter opposite to \(C\).

Now, let's consider the lines \(AE\), \(BD\), and \(KP\). Since \(K\) is the excenter, the line \(KP\) is the external angle bisector of \(\angle AKB\). The lines \(AE\) and \(BD\) are the angle bisectors of \(\angle BAC\) and \(\angle ABC\), respectively. The key observation is that the lines \(AE\), \(BD\), and \(KP\) are concurrent at the excenter \(K\). This is because the excenter \(K\) is the point where the external angle bisectors of the triangle intersect, and it is also the point where the lines \(AE\), \(BD\), and \(KP\) meet.

the quadrilateral $A I F E$ is cyclic. Denote its circumcircle by $\omega_{1}$. Similarly, the quadrilateral $B D G I$ is cyclic; denote its circumcircle by $\omega_{2}$.

The line $A E$ is the radical axis of $\omega$ and $\omega_{1}$, and the line $B D$ is the radical axis of $\omega$ and $\omega_{2}$. Let $t$ be the radical axis of $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$. These three lines meet at the radical center of the three circles, or they are parallel to each other. We will show that $t$ is in fact the line $P K$.

Let $L$ be the second intersection point of $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$, so $t=I L$. (If the two circles are tangent to each other then $L=I$ and $t$ is the common tangent.)

<img_3513>

Let the line $t$ meet the circumcircles of the triangles $A B L$ and $F G L$ at $K^{\prime} \neq L$ and $P^{\prime} \neq L$, respectively. Using oriented angles we have

$$
\angle\left(A B, B K^{\prime}\right)=\angle\left(A L, L K^{\prime}\right)=\angle(A L, L I)=\angle(A E, E I)=\angle(A E, E B)=\angle(A B, B K),
$$



so $B K^{\prime} \| B K$. Similarly we have $A K^{\prime} \| A K$, and therefore $K^{\prime}=K$. Next, we have

$$
\angle\left(P^{\prime} F, F G\right)=\angle\left(P^{\prime} L, L G\right)=\angle(I L, L G)=\angle(I D, D G)=\angle(A D, D E)=\angle(P F, F G),

hence $P^{\prime} F \| P F$ and similarly $P^{\prime} G \| P G$. Therefore $P^{\prime}=P$. This means that $t$ passes through $K$ and $P$, which finishes the proof.",0,False,499

The line $B D$ intersects the circle through $A, E$, and $B$ in two points $B$ and $F$. The lines $A F$ and $B E$ meet at a point $I$, and the lines $C I$ and $B D$ meet at a point $K$.

","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric properties of the triangle and the circle. Since $A B = A C$, triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with $D$ as the midpoint of $AC$. The angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ intersects the circle through $D, B$, and $C$ at point $E$. This means that $E$ is the point where the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ intersects the circumcircle of $\triangle BDC$.

Next, consider the circle through $A, E$, and $B$. The line $BD$ intersects this circle at points $B$ and $F$. This implies that $F$ is the second point of intersection of $BD$ with the circle through $A, E$, and $B$.

Now, let's look at the point $I$, which is the intersection of $AF$ and $BE$. We need to show that $I$ is the incenter of $\triangle KAB$. 

Since $E$ is on the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$, and $F$ is on the circle through $A, E$, and $B$, the line $AF$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ in the context of the circle through $A, E$, and $B$. This means that $I$ lies on the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ in $\triangle KAB$.

The point $K$ is the intersection of $CI$ and $BD$. Since $I$ lies on the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ and $K$ is the intersection of $CI$ and $BD$, it follows that $I$ is the incenter of $\triangle KAB$ because the angle bisectors of $\angle KAB$ and $\angle KBA$ meet at $I$.

</think>
<answer> $I$ is the incenter of $\triangle KAB$ </answer>","Let $D^{\prime}$ be the midpoint of the segment $A B$, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $B C$. By symmetry at line $A M$, the point $D^{\prime}$ has to lie on the circle $B C D$. Since the $\operatorname{arcs} D^{\prime} E$ and $E D$ of that circle are equal, we have $\angle A B I=\angle D^{\prime} B E=\angle E B D=I B K$, so $I$ lies on the angle bisector of $\angle A B K$. For this reason it suffices to prove in the sequel that the ray $A I$ bisects the angle $\angle B A K$.

From

$$
\angle D F A=180^{\circ}-\angle B F A=180^{\circ}-\angle B E A=\angle M E B=\frac{1}{2} \angle C E B=\frac{1}{2} \angle C D B
$$

we derive $\angle D F A=\angle D A F$ so the triangle $A F D$ is isosceles with $A D=D F$.

<img_3531>

Applying Menelaus's theorem to the triangle $A D F$ with respect to the line $C I K$, and applying the angle bisector theorem to the triangle $A B F$, we infer

$$
1=\frac{A C}{C D} \cdot \frac{D K}{K F} \cdot \frac{F I}{I A}=2 \cdot \frac{D K}{K F} \cdot \frac{B F}{A B}=2 \cdot \frac{D K}{K F} \cdot \frac{B F}{2 \cdot A D}=\frac{D K}{K F} \cdot \frac{B F}{A D}
$$

and therefore

$$
\frac{B D}{A D}=\frac{B F+F D}{A D}=\frac{B F}{A D}+1=\frac{K F}{D K}+1=\frac{D F}{D K}=\frac{A D}{D K}
$$



It follows that the triangles $A D K$ and $B D A$ are similar, hence $\angle D A K=\angle A B D$. Then

$$
\angle I A B=\angle A F D-\angle A B D=\angle D A F-\angle D A K=\angle K A I
$$

shows that the point $K$ is indeed lying on the angle bisector of $\angle B A K$.",0,False,409

Let $A B C D E F$ be a convex hexagon all of whose sides are tangent to a circle $\omega$ with center $O$. Suppose that the circumcircle of triangle $A C E$ is concentric with $\omega$. Let $J$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $C D$. Suppose that the perpendicular from $B$ to $D F$ intersects the line $E O$ at a point $K$. Let $L$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $K$ to $D E$. Prove that $D J=D L$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We know that the hexagon $ABCDEF$ is tangential to a circle $\omega$ with center $O$. This means that the circle is the incircle of the hexagon. Additionally, the circumcircle of triangle $ACE$ is concentric with $\omega$, which implies that $O$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle ACE$ as well. This means that $O$ is the center of the circle that is tangent to all sides of the hexagon, and it is also the center of the circle that circumscribes $\triangle ACE$.

Next, we need to consider the points $J$ and $K$. Point $J$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $CD$, and point $K$ is the intersection of the perpendicular from $B$ to $DF$ with the line $EO$. Point $L$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $K$ to $DE$.

Since $O$ is the center of the circle that is tangent to all sides of the hexagon, it is equidistant from all sides. This means that the perpendicular from $B$ to $CD$ will be perpendicular to $CD$ and will intersect $CD$ at a point that is equidistant from $C$ and $D$. Similarly, the perpendicular from $B$ to $DF$ will be perpendicular to $DF$ and will intersect $DF$ at a point that is equidistant from $D$ and $F$.

Now, since $K$ is the intersection of the perpendicular from $B$ to $DF$ with $EO$, and $L$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $K$ to $DE$, we can use the properties of perpendiculars and the fact that $O$ is the center of the circle to conclude that $K$ and $L$ are symmetric with respect to the line $EO$. This symmetry implies that the distances $DJ$ and $DL$ are equal because $J$ and $L$ are the feet of the perpendiculars from $B$ to $CD$ and from $K$ to $DE$, respectively, and they are symmetric with respect to the line $EO$.

Consider the rotation around point $D$ mapping $C$ to $E$; let $B^{\prime}$ and $L^{\prime}$ be the images of the points $B$ and $J$, respectively, under this rotation. Then one has $D J=D L^{\prime}$ and $B^{\prime} L^{\prime} \perp D E$; moreover, the triangles $B^{\prime} E D$ and $B C D$ are congruent. Since $\angle D E O<90^{\circ}$, the lines $E O$ and $B^{\prime} L^{\prime}$ intersect at some point $K^{\prime}$. We intend to prove that $K^{\prime} B \perp D F$; this would imply $K=K^{\prime}$, therefore $L=L^{\prime}$, which proves the problem statement.

Analogously, consider the rotation around $F$ mapping $A$ to $E$; let $B^{\prime \prime}$ be the image of $B$ under this rotation. Then the triangles $F A B$ and $F E B^{\prime \prime}$ are congruent. We have $E B^{\prime \prime}=A B=B C=$ $E B^{\prime}$ and $\angle F E B^{\prime \prime}=\angle F A B=\angle B C D=\angle D E B^{\prime}$, so the points $B^{\prime}$ and $B^{\prime \prime}$ are symmetrical with respect to the angle bisector $E O$ of $\angle D E F$. So, from $K^{\prime} B^{\prime} \perp D E$ we get $K^{\prime} B^{\prime \prime} \perp E F$. From these two relations we obtain

K^{\prime} D^{2}-K^{\prime} E^{2}=B^{\prime} D^{2}-B^{\prime} E^{2} \text { and } K^{\prime} E^{2}-K^{\prime} F^{2}=B^{\prime \prime} E^{2}-B^{\prime \prime} F^{2} \text {. }

Let $A B C$ be an acute triangle with circumcircle $\omega$. Let $t$ be a tangent line to $\omega$. Let $t_{a}, t_{b}$, and $t_{c}$ be the lines obtained by reflecting $t$ in the lines $B C, C A$, and $A B$, respectively. Show that the circumcircle of the triangle determined by the lines $t_{a}, t_{b}$, and $t_{c}$ is tangent to the circle $\omega$.

To avoid a large case distinction, we will use the notion of oriented angles. Namely, for two lines $\ell$ and $m$, we denote by $\angle(\ell, m)$ the angle by which one may rotate $\ell$ anticlockwise to obtain a line parallel to $m$. Thus, all oriented angles are considered modulo $180^{\circ}$.

","First, let's consider the tangent line $t$ to the circumcircle $\omega$ of the triangle $ABC$. When we reflect $t$ in the line $BC$, we get a new line $t_a$. Similarly, reflecting $t$ in the lines $CA$ and $AB$ gives us lines $t_b$ and $t_c$, respectively. We need to show that the circumcircle of the triangle $t_a t_b t_c$ is tangent to $\omega$.

To do this, we will use the fact that the angle between a tangent and a chord through the point of tangency is equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment. Let's denote the point of tangency of $t$ with $\omega$ as $P$. The angle $\angle(BC, t)$ is equal to the angle $\angle BAC$ (in the alternate segment), and similarly, $\angle(AC, t) = \angle ABC$ and $\angle(AB, t) = \angle ACB$.

Now, consider the reflection of $t$ in $BC$ to get $t_a$. The angle $\angle(BC, t_a)$ is the same as $\angle(BC, t)$, which is $\angle BAC$. Similarly, $\angle(AC, t_b) = \angle ABC$ and $\angle(AB, t_c) = \angle ACB$. This means that the angles between the lines $t_a, t_b, t_c$ and the sides of the triangle $ABC$ are the same as the angles between the sides of the triangle and the tangent $t$.

The circumcircle of the triangle $t_a t_b t_c$ will be tangent to $\omega$ if the angle between the line $t_a$ and the line $t$ is $90^\circ$. This is true because the angle between $t_a$ and $t$ is $\angle BAC$, and the angle between $t$ and the line through $P$ perpendicular to $BC$ is also $\angle BAC$ (since $t$ is tangent to $\omega$ at $P$).

\[
\boxed{\text{The circumcircle of the triangle } t_a t_b t_c \text{ is tangent to the circle } \omega.}
\]","Denote by $T$ the point of tangency of $t$ and $\omega$. Let $A^{\prime}=t_{b} \cap t_{c}, B^{\prime}=t_{a} \cap t_{c}$, $C^{\prime}=t_{a} \cap t_{b}$. Introduce the point $A^{\prime \prime}$ on $\omega$ such that $T A=A A^{\prime \prime}\left(A^{\prime \prime} \neq T\right.$ unless $T A$ is a diameter). Define the points $B^{\prime \prime}$ and $C^{\prime \prime}$ in a similar way.

Since the points $C$ and $B$ are the midpoints of arcs $T C^{\prime \prime}$ and $T B^{\prime \prime}$, respectively, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\angle\left(t, B^{\prime \prime} C^{\prime \prime}\right) & =\angle\left(t, T C^{\prime \prime}\right)+\angle\left(T C^{\prime \prime}, B^{\prime \prime} C^{\prime \prime}\right)=2 \angle(t, T C)+2 \angle\left(T C^{\prime \prime}, B C^{\prime \prime}\right) \\
& =2(\angle(t, T C)+\angle(T C, B C))=2 \angle(t, B C)=\angle\left(t, t_{a}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

It follows that $t_{a}$ and $B^{\prime \prime} C^{\prime \prime}$ are parallel. Similarly, $t_{b} \| A^{\prime \prime} C^{\prime \prime}$ and $t_{c} \| A^{\prime \prime} B^{\prime \prime}$. Thus, either the triangles $A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ and $A^{\prime \prime} B^{\prime \prime} C^{\prime \prime}$ are homothetic, or they are translates of each other. Now we will prove that they are in fact homothetic, and that the center $K$ of the homothety belongs



to $\omega$. It would then follow that their circumcircles are also homothetic with respect to $K$ and are therefore tangent at this point, as desired.

We need the two following claims.

Claim 1. The point of intersection $X$ of the lines $B^{\prime \prime} C$ and $B C^{\prime \prime}$ lies on $t_{a}$.

Proof. Actually, the points $X$ and $T$ are symmetric about the line $B C$, since the lines $C T$ and $C B^{\prime \prime}$ are symmetric about this line, as are the lines $B T$ and $B C^{\prime \prime}$.

Claim 2. The point of intersection $I$ of the lines $B B^{\prime}$ and $C C^{\prime}$ lies on the circle $\omega$.

Proof. We consider the case that $t$ is not parallel to the sides of $A B C$; the other cases may be regarded as limit cases. Let $D=t \cap B C, E=t \cap A C$, and $F=t \cap A B$.

Due to symmetry, the line $D B$ is one of the angle bisectors of the lines $B^{\prime} D$ and $F D$; analogously, the line $F B$ is one of the angle bisectors of the lines $B^{\prime} F$ and $D F$. So $B$ is either the incenter or one of the excenters of the triangle $B^{\prime} D F$. In any case we have $\angle(B D, D F)+\angle(D F, F B)+$ $\angle\left(B^{\prime} B, B^{\prime} D\right)=90^{\circ}$, so

$$
\angle\left(B^{\prime} B, B^{\prime} C^{\prime}\right)=\angle\left(B^{\prime} B, B^{\prime} D\right)=90^{\circ}-\angle(B C, D F)-\angle(D F, B A)=90^{\circ}-\angle(B C, A B) .
$$

Analogously, we get $\angle\left(C^{\prime} C, B^{\prime} C^{\prime}\right)=90^{\circ}-\angle(B C, A C)$. Hence,

$$
\angle(B I, C I)=\angle\left(B^{\prime} B, B^{\prime} C^{\prime}\right)+\angle\left(B^{\prime} C^{\prime}, C^{\prime} C\right)=\angle(B C, A C)-\angle(B C, A B)=\angle(A B, A C),
$$

which means exactly that the points $A, B, I, C$ are concyclic.

Now we can complete the proof. Let $K$ be the second intersection point of $B^{\prime} B^{\prime \prime}$ and $\omega$. Applying PASCAL's theorem to hexagon $K B^{\prime \prime} C I B C^{\prime \prime}$ we get that the points $B^{\prime}=K B^{\prime \prime} \cap I B$ and $X=B^{\prime \prime} C \cap B C^{\prime \prime}$ are collinear with the intersection point $S$ of $C I$ and $C^{\prime \prime} K$. So $S=$ $C I \cap B^{\prime} X=C^{\prime}$, and the points $C^{\prime}, C^{\prime \prime}, K$ are collinear. Thus $K$ is the intersection point of $B^{\prime} B^{\prime \prime}$ and $C^{\prime} C^{\prime \prime}$ which implies that $K$ is the center of the homothety mapping $A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ to $A^{\prime \prime} B^{\prime \prime} C^{\prime \prime}$, and it belongs to $\omega$.",0,False,481

For any integer $d>0$, let $f(d)$ be the smallest positive integer that has exactly $d$ positive divisors (so for example we have $f(1)=1, f(5)=16$, and $f(6)=12$ ). Prove that for every integer $k \geq 0$ the number $f\left(2^{k}\right)$ divides $f\left(2^{k+1}\right)$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the function $f(d)$. The function $f(d)$ gives the smallest positive integer that has exactly $d$ positive divisors. We need to show that for every integer $k \geq 0$, the number $f(2^k)$ divides $f(2^{k+1})$.

Let's start by examining the structure of $f(2^k)$. The number $2^k$ has divisors that are powers of 2, specifically $1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^k$. The number of divisors of $2^k$ is $k+1$ (since each of the exponents from 0 to $k$ gives a distinct divisor). The smallest number with exactly $k+1$ divisors is $2^k$ itself, because it is the smallest number that can be formed with exactly $k+1$ divisors. So, $f(2^k) = 2^k$.

Now, let's consider $f(2^{k+1})$. The number $2^{k+1}$ has divisors that are powers of 2, specifically $1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^{k+1}$. The number of divisors of $2^{k+1}$ is $k+2$ (since each of the exponents from 0 to $k+1$ gives a distinct divisor). The smallest number with exactly $k+2$ divisors is $2^{k+1}$ itself, because it is the smallest number that can be formed with exactly $k+2$ divisors. So, $f(2^{k+1}) = 2^{k+1}$.

Now, we need to show that $f(2^k) = 2^k$ divides $f(2^{k+1}) = 2^{k+1}$. Clearly, $2^k$ divides $2^{k+1}$, as $2^{k+1} = 2 \cdot 2^k$. This is true for all $k \geq 0$.

<answer>2^k</answer>","For any positive integer $n$, let $d(n)$ be the number of positive divisors of $n$. Let $n=\prod_{p} p^{a(p)}$ be the prime factorization of $n$ where $p$ ranges over the prime numbers, the integers $a(p)$ are nonnegative and all but finitely many $a(p)$ are zero. Then we have $d(n)=\prod_{p}(a(p)+1)$. Thus, $d(n)$ is a power of 2 if and only if for every prime $p$ there is a nonnegative integer $b(p)$ with $a(p)=2^{b(p)}-1=1+2+2^{2}+\cdots+2^{b(p)-1}$. We then have

$$
n=\prod_{p} \prod_{i=0}^{b(p)-1} p^{2^{i}}, \quad \text { and } \quad d(n)=2^{k} \quad \text { with } \quad k=\sum_{p} b(p)
$$

Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all numbers of the form $p^{2^{r}}$ with $p$ prime and $r$ a nonnegative integer. Then we deduce that $d(n)$ is a power of 2 if and only if $n$ is the product of the elements of some finite subset $\mathcal{T}$ of $\mathcal{S}$ that satisfies the following condition: for all $t \in \mathcal{T}$ and $s \in \mathcal{S}$ with $s \mid t$ we have $s \in \mathcal{T}$. Moreover, if $d(n)=2^{k}$ then the corresponding set $\mathcal{T}$ has $k$ elements.

Note that the $\operatorname{set} \mathcal{T}_{k}$ consisting of the smallest $k$ elements from $\mathcal{S}$ obviously satisfies the condition above. Thus, given $k$, the smallest $n$ with $d(n)=2^{k}$ is the product of the elements of $\mathcal{T}_{k}$. This $n$ is $f\left(2^{k}\right)$. Since obviously $\mathcal{T}_{k} \subset \mathcal{T}_{k+1}$, it follows that $f\left(2^{k}\right) \mid f\left(2^{k+1}\right)$.",0,False,474

Consider a polynomial $P(x)=\left(x+d_{1}\right)\left(x+d_{2}\right) \cdot \ldots \cdot\left(x+d_{9}\right)$, where $d_{1}, d_{2}, \ldots, d_{9}$ are nine distinct integers. Prove that there exists an integer $N$ such that for all integers $x \geq N$ the number $P(x)$ is divisible by a prime number greater than 20 .
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the polynomial $P(x) = (x + d_1)(x + d_2) \cdots (x + d_9)$. We need to show that there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $x \geq N$, $P(x)$ is divisible by a prime number greater than 20. 

One way to approach this is to consider the behavior of the polynomial as $x$ increases. As $x$ gets larger, the polynomial will grow very quickly. We need to find a point where the polynomial's value is divisible by a prime number greater than 20. 

Let's consider the polynomial evaluated at $x = 20$. We have:
\[ P(20) = (20 + d_1)(20 + d_2) \cdots (20 + d_9). \]
Since $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_9$ are distinct integers, and at least one of them is greater than 20, the product $P(20)$ will be divisible by a prime number greater than 20. 

To be more precise, if we take $d_1 = 21$, then $P(20) = (20 + 21)(20 + d_2) \cdots (20 + d_9) = 41 \cdot (20 + d_2) \cdots (20 + d_9)$. Here, 41 is a prime number greater than 20, and it divides $P(20)$. 

Thus, we can conclude that there exists an integer $N = 20$ such that for all integers $x \geq N$, the number $P(x)$ is divisible by a prime number greater than 20. </think>
<answer>20</answer>","Note that the statement of the problem is invariant under translations of $x$; hence without loss of generality we may suppose that the numbers $d_{1}, d_{2}, \ldots, d_{9}$ are positive.

The key observation is that there are only eight primes below 20, while $P(x)$ involves more than eight factors.

We shall prove that $N=d^{8}$ satisfies the desired property, where $d=\max \left\{d_{1}, d_{2}, \ldots, d_{9}\right\}$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is some integer $x \geq N$ such that $P(x)$ is composed of primes below 20 only. Then for every index $i \in\{1,2, \ldots, 9\}$ the number $x+d_{i}$ can be expressed as product of powers of the first 8 primes.

Since $x+d_{i}>x \geq d^{8}$ there is some prime power $f_{i}>d$ that divides $x+d_{i}$. Invoking the pigeonhole principle we see that there are two distinct indices $i$ and $j$ such that $f_{i}$ and $f_{j}$ are powers of the same prime number. For reasons of symmetry, we may suppose that $f_{i} \leq f_{j}$. Now both of the numbers $x+d_{i}$ and $x+d_{j}$ are divisible by $f_{i}$ and hence so is their difference $d_{i}-d_{j}$. But as

$$
0<\left|d_{i}-d_{j}\right| \leq \max \left(d_{i}, d_{j}\right) \leq d<f_{i}
$$

this is impossible. Thereby the problem is solved.",0,False,403

Let $f$ be a function from the set of integers to the set of positive integers. Suppose that for any two integers $m$ and $n$, the difference $f(m)-f(n)$ is divisible by $f(m-n)$. Prove that for all integers $m, n$ with $f(m) \leq f(n)$ the number $f(n)$ is divisible by $f(m)$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: for any two integers \( m \) and \( n \), the difference \( f(m) - f(n) \) is divisible by \( f(m - n) \). This means that there exists an integer \( k \) such that:
\[ f(m) - f(n) = k f(m - n). \]

We need to show that for all integers \( m \) and \( n \) with \( f(m) \leq f(n) \), the number \( f(n) \) is divisible by \( f(m) \). Let's start by considering the case when \( m = 0 \). The condition simplifies to:
\[ f(n) = k f(n). \]
This implies that \( k = 1 \), so:
\[ f(n) = f(n). \]
This is trivially true and doesn't give us new information. Now, let's consider the general case where \( m \neq 0 \).

Since \( f(m) \leq f(n) \), we can write:
\[ f(n) - f(m) = k f(m - k). \]
We need to show that \( k = 1 \). If \( k \neq 1 \), then:
\[ f(n) - f(m) = k f(m - k). \]
Since \( f(m) \leq f(n) \), we can consider the possibility that \( k = 1 \) might be a solution. If we assume \( k = 1 \), then:
\[ f(n) - f(m) = f(m - k). \]
This implies that:
\[ f(n) = f(m) + f(m - k). \]
Since \( k = 1 \), we have:
\[ f(n) = f(m) + f(m - 1). \]
This pattern suggests that \( k = 1 \) is indeed the only solution that fits the given condition. </think>
<answer> $$ f(n) = k f(m) $$ </answer>","Suppose that $x$ and $y$ are two integers with $f(x)<f(y)$. We will show that $f(x) \mid f(y)$. By taking $m=x$ and $n=y$ we see that

$$
f(x-y)|| f(x)-f(y) \mid=f(y)-f(x)>0
$$

so $f(x-y) \leq f(y)-f(x)<f(y)$. Hence the number $d=f(x)-f(x-y)$ satisfies

$$
-f(y)<-f(x-y)<d<f(x)<f(y) .
$$

Taking $m=x$ and $n=x-y$ we see that $f(y) \mid d$, so we deduce $d=0$, or in other words $f(x)=f(x-y)$. Taking $m=x$ and $n=y$ we see that $f(x)=f(x-y) \mid f(x)-f(y)$, which implies $f(x) \mid f(y)$.",0,False,431

Let $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ be two polynomials with integer coefficients such that no nonconstant polynomial with rational coefficients divides both $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$. Suppose that for every positive integer $n$ the integers $P(n)$ and $Q(n)$ are positive, and $2^{Q(n)}-1$ divides $3^{P(n)}-1$. Prove that $Q(x)$ is a constant polynomial.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We know that $2^{Q(n)}-1$ divides $3^{P(n)}-1$ for every positive integer $n$. This means that $3^{P(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{Q(n)}-1}$. 

Since $2^{Q(n)}-1$ is odd, it follows that $3^{P(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{Q(n)}-1}$ implies that $P(n)$ must be even, because if $P(n)$ were odd, then $3^{P(n)} \equiv 3 \pmod{2^{Q(n)}-1}$, which would not be congruent to 1. 

Now, let's consider the polynomial $P(x)$. Since $P(x)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients and $P(n)$ is even for every positive integer $n$, $P(x)$ must be an even polynomial. This means that all the coefficients of $P(x)$ are even. 

Next, let's consider the polynomial $Q(x)$. We need to show that $Q(x)$ is a constant polynomial. Suppose $Q(x)$ is not a constant polynomial. Then, $Q(x)$ has a non-constant term, and since $2^{Q(n)}-1$ divides $3^{P(n)}-1$ for every positive integer $n$, the degree of $Q(x)$ must be such that the divisibility condition holds for all $n$. 

However, if $Q(x)$ were to have a non-constant term, then for large enough $n$, the term in $Q(n)$ would dominate, and the divisibility condition would not hold for all $n$. This contradiction implies that $Q(x)$ must be a constant polynomial. </think>
<answer>Q(x) = k</answer>","First we show that there exists an integer $d$ such that for all positive integers $n$ we have $\operatorname{gcd}(P(n), Q(n)) \leq d$.

Since $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are coprime (over the polynomials with rational coefficients), EuCLID's algorithm provides some polynomials $R_{0}(x), S_{0}(x)$ with rational coefficients such that $P(x) R_{0}(x)-$ $Q(x) S_{0}(x)=1$. Multiplying by a suitable positive integer $d$, we obtain polynomials $R(x)=$ $d \cdot R_{0}(x)$ and $S(x)=d \cdot S_{0}(x)$ with integer coefficients for which $P(x) R(x)-Q(x) S(x)=d$. Then we have $\operatorname{gcd}(P(n), Q(n)) \leq d$ for any integer $n$.

To prove the problem statement, suppose that $Q(x)$ is not constant. Then the sequence $Q(n)$ is not bounded and we can choose a positive integer $m$ for which

$$
M=2^{Q(m)}-1 \geq 3^{\max \{P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(d)\}}
\tag{1}
$$

Since $M=2^{Q(n)}-1 \mid 3^{P(n)}-1$, we have $2,3 \not \backslash M$. Let $a$ and $b$ be the multiplicative orders of 2 and 3 modulo $M$, respectively. Obviously, $a=Q(m)$ since the lower powers of 2 do not reach $M$. Since $M$ divides $3^{P(m)}-1$, we have $b \mid P(m)$. Then $\operatorname{gcd}(a, b) \leq \operatorname{gcd}(P(m), Q(m)) \leq d$. Since the expression $a x-b y$ attains all integer values divisible by $\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)$ when $x$ and $y$ run over all nonnegative integer values, there exist some nonnegative integers $x, y$ such that $1 \leq m+a x-b y \leq d$.

By $Q(m+a x) \equiv Q(m)(\bmod a)$ we have

$$
2^{Q(m+a x)} \equiv 2^{Q(m)} \equiv 1 \quad(\bmod M)
$$

and therefore

$$
M\left|2^{Q(m+a x)}-1\right| 3^{P(m+a x)}-1 .
$$

Then, by $P(m+a x-b y) \equiv P(m+a x)(\bmod b)$ we have

$$
3^{P(m+a x-b y)} \equiv 3^{P(m+a x)} \equiv 1 \quad(\bmod M)
$$

Since $P(m+a x-b y)>0$ this implies $M \leq 3^{P(m+a x-b y)}-1$. But $P(m+a x-b y)$ is listed among $P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(d)$, so

$$
M<3^{P(m+a x-b y)} \leq 3^{\max \{P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(d)\}}

Let $p$ be an odd prime number. For every integer $a$, define the number

$$

Let $m$ and $n$ be integers such that

$$
S_{3}+S_{4}-3 S_{2}=\frac{m}{n}

Prove that $p$ divides $m$.

","First, let's consider the expression for $S_a$:
$$
S_a = \frac{a}{1} + \frac{a^2}{2} + \cdots + \frac{a^{p-1}}{p-1}
$$
We need to evaluate $S_3 + S_4 - 3S_2$ and show that it is of the form $\frac{m}{n}$ where $p$ divides $m$.

Let's start by calculating $S_2$, $S_3$, and $S_4$:
- $S_2 = \frac{2}{1} + \frac{2^2}{2} = 2 + 2 = 4$
- $S_3 = \frac{3}{1} + \frac{3^2}{2} + \frac{3^3}{3} = 3 + \frac{9}{2} + 3 = 6 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{12 + 9}{2} = \frac{21}{2}$
- $S_4 = \frac{4}{1} + \frac{4^2}{2} + \frac{4^3}{3} + \frac{4^4}{4} = 4 + \frac{16}{2} + \frac{64}{3} + 16 = 4 + 8 + \frac{64}{3} + 16 = \frac{12 + 256 + 48}{3} = \frac{280}{3}$

Now, let's compute $S_3 + S_4 - 3S_2$:
\[
S_3 + S_4 - 3S_2 = \frac{21}{2} + \frac{280}{3} - 3 \cdot 4 = \frac{21}{2} + \frac{280}{3} - 12 = \frac{63 + 560 - 72}{6} = \frac{551}{6}
\]
</think>
\[
\frac{551}{6} = \frac{m}{n} \implies m = 551, \quad n = 6

write $p_{1} / q_{1} \equiv p_{2} / q_{2}(\bmod p)$ if the numerator $p_{1} q_{2}-p_{2} q_{1}$ of their difference is divisible by $p$.

We start with finding an explicit formula for the residue of $S_{a}$ modulo $p$. Note first that for every $k=1, \ldots, p-1$ the number $\left(\begin{array}{l}p \\ k\end{array}\right)$ is divisible by $p$, and

$$
\frac{1}{p}\left(\begin{array}{l}
p \\
k
\end{array}\right)=\frac{(p-1)(p-2) \cdots(p-k+1)}{k !} \equiv \frac{(-1) \cdot(-2) \cdots(-k+1)}{k !}=\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k} \quad(\bmod p)
$$

Therefore, we have

$$
S_{a}=-\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \frac{(-a)^{k}(-1)^{k-1}}{k} \equiv-\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}(-a)^{k} \cdot \frac{1}{p}\left(\begin{array}{l}
p \\
k
\end{array}\right) \quad(\bmod p)
$$

The number on the right-hand side is integer. Using the binomial formula we express it as

$$
-\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}(-a)^{k} \cdot \frac{1}{p}\left(\begin{array}{l}
p \\
k
\end{array}\right)=-\frac{1}{p}\left(-1-(-a)^{p}+\sum_{k=0}^{p}(-a)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{l}
p \\
k
\end{array}\right)\right)=\frac{(a-1)^{p}-a^{p}+1}{p}
$$

since $p$ is odd. So, we have

$$
S_{a} \equiv \frac{(a-1)^{p}-a^{p}+1}{p} \quad(\bmod p)
$$

Finally, using the obtained formula we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
S_{3}+S_{4}-3 S_{2} & \equiv \frac{\left(2^{p}-3^{p}+1\right)+\left(3^{p}-4^{p}+1\right)-3\left(1^{p}-2^{p}+1\right)}{p} \\
& =\frac{4 \cdot 2^{p}-4^{p}-4}{p}=-\frac{\left(2^{p}-2\right)^{2}}{p} \quad(\bmod p) .
\end{aligned}
$$

By Fermat's theorem, $p \mid 2^{p}-2$, so $p^{2} \mid\left(2^{p}-2\right)^{2}$ and hence $S_{3}+S_{4}-3 S_{2} \equiv 0(\bmod p)$.",0,False,4758

Let $k$ be a positive integer and set $n=2^{k}+1$. Prove that $n$ is a prime number if and only if the following holds: there is a permutation $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ of the numbers $1,2, \ldots, n-1$ and a sequence of integers $g_{1}, g_{2}, \ldots, g_{n-1}$ such that $n$ divides $g_{i}^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}$ for every $i \in\{1,2, \ldots, n-1\}$, where we set $a_{n}=a_{1}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: there is a permutation $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ of the numbers $1, 2, \ldots, n-1$ and a sequence of integers $g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_{n-1}$ such that $n$ divides $g_i^{a_i} - a_{i+1}$ for every $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}$, with $a_n = a_1$.

We need to prove that $n = 2^k + 1$ is a prime number under this condition. 

First, let's consider the case when $n$ is not prime. If $n$ is not prime, then $n$ can be factored into two integers $m$ and $p$ where $1 < m, p < n$. This means that $n = mp$. Now, if we can find a permutation and a sequence that satisfy the given condition, then $n$ would not be prime, which contradicts our assumption. 

So, let's assume $n$ is prime. We need to show that the given condition holds. 

Since $n$ is prime, the only divisors of $n$ are 1 and $n$ itself. We need to find a sequence $g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_{n-1}$ and a permutation $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ such that $n$ divides $g_i^{a_i} - a_{i+1}$ for every $i$. 

One way to approach this is to consider the properties of the numbers and the operations involved. If we can find a sequence of integers $g_i$ and a permutation $a_i$ that satisfy the condition, then we have shown that $n$ can indeed be expressed in the required form. </think>
<answer> ... ... ... </answer>","Let $N=\{1,2, \ldots, n-1\}$. For $a, b \in N$, we say that $b$ follows $a$ if there exists an integer $g$ such that $b \equiv g^{a}(\bmod n)$ and denote this property as $a \rightarrow b$. This way we have a directed graph with $N$ as set of vertices. If $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ is a permutation of $1,2, \ldots, n-1$ such that $a_{1} \rightarrow a_{2} \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow a_{n-1} \rightarrow a_{1}$ then this is a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph.

Step I. First consider the case when $n$ is composite. Let $n=p_{1}^{\alpha_{1}} \ldots p_{s}^{\alpha_{s}}$ be its prime factorization. All primes $p_{i}$ are odd.

Suppose that $\alpha_{i}>1$ for some $i$. For all integers $a, g$ with $a \geq 2$, we have $g^{a} \not \equiv p_{i}\left(\bmod p_{i}^{2}\right)$, because $g^{a}$ is either divisible by $p_{i}^{2}$ or it is not divisible by $p_{i}$. It follows that in any Hamiltonian cycle $p_{i}$ comes immediately after 1 . The same argument shows that $2 p_{i}$ also should come immediately after 1, which is impossible. Hence, there is no Hamiltonian cycle in the graph.

Now suppose that $n$ is square-free. We have $n=p_{1} p_{2} \ldots p_{s}>9$ and $s \geq 2$. Assume that there exists a Hamiltonian cycle. There are $\frac{n-1}{2}$ even numbers in this cycle, and each number which follows one of them should be a quadratic residue modulo $n$. So, there should be at least $\frac{n-1}{2}$ nonzero quadratic residues modulo $n$. On the other hand, for each $p_{i}$ there exist exactly $\frac{p_{i}+1}{2}$ quadratic residues modulo $p_{i}$; by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the number of quadratic residues modulo $n$ is exactly $\frac{p_{1}+1}{2} \cdot \frac{p_{2}+1}{2} \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{p_{s}+1}{2}$, including 0 . Then we have a contradiction by

$$
\frac{p_{1}+1}{2} \cdot \frac{p_{2}+1}{2} \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{p_{s}+1}{2} \leq \frac{2 p_{1}}{3} \cdot \frac{2 p_{2}}{3} \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{2 p_{s}}{3}=\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{s} n \leq \frac{4 n}{9}<\frac{n-1}{2}
$$

This proves the ""if""-part of the problem.

Step II. Now suppose that $n$ is prime. For any $a \in N$, denote by $\nu_{2}(a)$ the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of $a$, and let $\mu(a)=\max \left\{t \in[0, k] \mid 2^{t} \rightarrow a\right\}$.

Lemma. For any $a, b \in N$, we have $a \rightarrow b$ if and only if $\nu_{2}(a) \leq \mu(b)$.

Proof. Let $\ell=\nu_{2}(a)$ and $m=\mu(b)$.

Suppose $\ell \leq m$. Since $b$ follows $2^{m}$, there exists some $g_{0}$ such that $b \equiv g_{0}^{2^{m}}(\bmod n)$. By $\operatorname{gcd}(a, n-1)=2^{\ell}$ there exist some integers $p$ and $q$ such that $p a-q(n-1)=2^{\ell}$. Choosing $g=g_{0}^{2^{m-\ell} p}$ we have $g^{a}=g_{0}^{2^{m-\ell} p a}=g_{0}^{2^{m}+2^{m-\ell} q(n-1)} \equiv g_{0}^{2^{m}} \equiv b(\bmod n)$ by FERMAT's theorem. Hence, $a \rightarrow b$.

To prove the reverse statement, suppose that $a \rightarrow b$, so $b \equiv g^{a}(\bmod n)$ with some $g$. Then $b \equiv\left(g^{a / 2^{\ell}}\right)^{2^{\ell}}$, and therefore $2^{\ell} \rightarrow b$. By the definition of $\mu(b)$, we have $\mu(b) \geq \ell$. The lemma is



proved.

Now for every $i$ with $0 \leq i \leq k$, let

$$
\begin{aligned}
A_{i} & =\left\{a \in N \mid \nu_{2}(a)=i\right\}, \\
B_{i} & =\{a \in N \mid \mu(a)=i\}, \\
\text { and } C_{i} & =\{a \in N \mid \mu(a) \geq i\}=B_{i} \cup B_{i+1} \cup \ldots \cup B_{k} .
\end{aligned}
$$

We claim that $\left|A_{i}\right|=\left|B_{i}\right|$ for all $0 \leq i \leq k$. Obviously we have $\left|A_{i}\right|=2^{k-i-1}$ for all $i=$ $0, \ldots, k-1$, and $\left|A_{k}\right|=1$. Now we determine $\left|C_{i}\right|$. We have $\left|C_{0}\right|=n-1$ and by Fermat's theorem we also have $C_{k}=\{1\}$, so $\left|C_{k}\right|=1$. Next, notice that $C_{i+1}=\left\{x^{2} \bmod n \mid x \in C_{i}\right\}$. For every $a \in N$, the relation $x^{2} \equiv a(\bmod n)$ has at most two solutions in $N$. Therefore we have $2\left|C_{i+1}\right| \leq\left|C_{i}\right|$, with the equality achieved only if for every $y \in C_{i+1}$, there exist distinct elements $x, x^{\prime} \in C_{i}$ such that $x^{2} \equiv x^{\prime 2} \equiv y(\bmod n)$ (this implies $\left.x+x^{\prime}=n\right)$. Now, since $2^{k}\left|C_{k}\right|=\left|C_{0}\right|$, we obtain that this equality should be achieved in each step. Hence $\left|C_{i}\right|=2^{k-i}$ for $0 \leq i \leq k$, and therefore $\left|B_{i}\right|=2^{k-i-1}$ for $0 \leq i \leq k-1$ and $\left|B_{k}\right|=1$.

From the previous arguments we can see that for each $z \in C_{i}(0 \leq i<k)$ the equation $x^{2} \equiv z^{2}$ $(\bmod n)$ has two solutions in $C_{i}$, so we have $n-z \in C_{i}$. Hence, for each $i=0,1, \ldots, k-1$, exactly half of the elements of $C_{i}$ are odd. The same statement is valid for $B_{i}=C_{i} \backslash C_{i+1}$ for $0 \leq i \leq k-2$. In particular, each such $B_{i}$ contains an odd number. Note that $B_{k}=\{1\}$ also contains an odd number, and $B_{k-1}=\left\{2^{k}\right\}$ since $C_{k-1}$ consists of the two square roots of 1 modulo $n$.

Step III. Now we construct a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph. First, for each $i$ with $0 \leq i \leq k$, connect the elements of $A_{i}$ to the elements of $B_{i}$ by means of an arbitrary bijection. After performing this for every $i$, we obtain a subgraph with all vertices having in-degree 1 and outdegree 1, so the subgraph is a disjoint union of cycles. If there is a unique cycle, we are done. Otherwise, we modify the subgraph in such a way that the previous property is preserved and the number of cycles decreases; after a finite number of steps we arrive at a single cycle.

For every cycle $C$, let $\lambda(C)=\min _{c \in C} \nu_{2}(c)$. Consider a cycle $C$ for which $\lambda(C)$ is maximal. If $\lambda(C)=0$, then for any other cycle $C^{\prime}$ we have $\lambda\left(C^{\prime}\right)=0$. Take two arbitrary vertices $a \in C$ and $a^{\prime} \in C^{\prime}$ such that $\nu_{2}(a)=\nu_{2}\left(a^{\prime}\right)=0$; let their direct successors be $b$ and $b^{\prime}$, respectively. Then we can unify $C$ and $C^{\prime}$ to a single cycle by replacing the edges $a \rightarrow b$ and $a^{\prime} \rightarrow b^{\prime}$ by $a \rightarrow b^{\prime}$ and $a^{\prime} \rightarrow b$.

Now suppose that $\lambda=\lambda(C) \geq 1$; let $a \in C \cap A_{\lambda}$. If there exists some $a^{\prime} \in A_{\lambda} \backslash C$, then $a^{\prime}$ lies in another cycle $C^{\prime}$ and we can merge the two cycles in exactly the same way as above. So, the only remaining case is $A_{\lambda} \subset C$. Since the edges from $A_{\lambda}$ lead to $B_{\lambda}$, we get also $B_{\lambda} \subset C$. If $\lambda \neq k-1$ then $B_{\lambda}$ contains an odd number; this contradicts the assumption $\lambda(C)>0$. Finally, if $\lambda=k-1$, then $C$ contains $2^{k-1}$ which is the only element of $A_{k-1}$. Since $B_{k-1}=\left\{2^{k}\right\}=A_{k}$ and $B_{k}=\{1\}$, the cycle $C$ contains the path $2^{k-1} \rightarrow 2^{k} \rightarrow 1$ and it contains an odd number again. This completes the proof of the ""only if""-part of the problem.",0,False,433

Let the real numbers $a, b, c, d$ satisfy the relations $a+b+c+d=6$ and $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}=12$. Prove that

$$
36 \leq 4\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}+d^{3}\right)-\left(a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4}+d^{4}\right) \leq 48 .
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions: \(a + b + c + d = 6\) and \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 12\). We need to prove that \(36 \leq 4(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4) \leq 48\).

We start by examining the expression \(4(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4)\). To simplify this, let's consider the possible values of \(a, b, c, d\). Given the constraints, it's reasonable to assume that the numbers are close to each other, as their sum and sum of squares are relatively small. 

Let's test if we can find a set of values that satisfy the conditions and make the expression equal to 36 or 48. 

If we assume \(a = b = c = d = 1.5\), then:
- \(a + b + c + d = 6\)
- \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 12\)
- \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 = 4 \times 1.5^3 = 4 \times 3.375 = 13.5\)
- \(a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 = 1.5^4 = 5.0625\)

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
- \(4(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4) = 4 \times 13.5 - 5.0625 = 54 - 5.0625 = 36.9375\), which is close to 36, but not quite there. 

</think>
\</answer>","Observe that

$$
\begin{gathered}
4\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}+d^{3}\right)-\left(a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4}+d^{4}\right)=-\left((a-1)^{4}+(b-1)^{4}+(c-1)^{4}+(d-1)^{4}\right) \\
+6\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}\right)-4(a+b+c+d)+4 \\
=-\left((a-1)^{4}+(b-1)^{4}+(c-1)^{4}+(d-1)^{4}\right)+52
\end{gathered}
$$

Now, introducing $x=a-1, y=b-1, z=c-1, t=d-1$, we need to prove the inequalities

$$
16 \geq x^{4}+y^{4}+z^{4}+t^{4} \geq 4
$$

under the constraint

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+t^{2}=\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}\right)-2(a+b+c+d)+4=4
\tag{1}
$$

(we will not use the value of $x+y+z+t$ though it can be found).

Now the rightmost inequality in (1) follows from the power mean inequality:

$$
x^{4}+y^{4}+z^{4}+t^{4} \geq \frac{\left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+t^{2}\right)^{2}}{4}=4
$$

For the other one, expanding the brackets we note that

$$
\left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+t^{2}\right)^{2}=\left(x^{4}+y^{4}+z^{4}+t^{4}\right)+q,
$$

where $q$ is a nonnegative number, so

$$
x^{4}+y^{4}+z^{4}+t^{4} \leq\left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+t^{2}\right)^{2}=16
$$

- $x_4 = -x_2 = 1$
- $x_5 = (-1)^{2+1} x_2 = -1$
- $x_6 = -x_3 = -1$
- $x_7 = (-1)^{3+1} x_3 = 1$
- $x_8 = -x_4 = -1$

From this, we can see that the sequence alternates between positive and negative values, and the absolute values of the terms are 1. Now, let's consider the sum of the first $n$ terms. We can group the terms in pairs to see if we can simplify the sum:
- For $n = 1$, the sum is $1$.
- For $n = 2$, the sum is $1 + (-1) = 0$.
- For $n = 3$, the sum is $1 + (-1) + 1 = 1$.
- For $n = 4$, the sum is $1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) = 0$.
- For $n = 5$, the sum is $1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1$.
- For $n = 6$, the sum is $1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) = 0$.
- For $n = 7$, the sum is $1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1$.
- For $n = 8$, the sum is $1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) = 0$.

From this, we can see that the sum of the first $n$ terms is 1 if $n$ is odd and 0 if $n$ is even. Since we need to show that the sum is non-negative, and it is 1 for odd $n$ and 0 for even $n$, the statement holds true for all $n \geq 1$.
<answer> $$x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n \geq 0$$ </answer>","We start with some observations. First, from the definition of $x_{i}$ it follows that for each positive integer $k$ we have

$$
x_{4 k-3}=x_{2 k-1}=-x_{4 k-2} \quad \text { and } \quad x_{4 k-1}=x_{4 k}=-x_{2 k}=x_{k} \text {. }
\tag{1}
$$

Hence, denoting $S_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$, we have

$$
S_{4 k}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\left(\left(x_{4 k-3}+x_{4 k-2}\right)+\left(x_{4 k-1}+x_{4 k}\right)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\left(0+2 x_{k}\right)=2 S_{k}\tag{2}
$$
$$
S_{4 k+2}=S_{4 k}+\left(x_{4 k+1}+x_{4 k+2}\right)=S_{4 k}\tag{3}
$$

Observe also that $S_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1=n(\bmod 2)$.

Now we prove by induction on $k$ that $S_{i} \geq 0$ for all $i \leq 4 k$. The base case is valid since $x_{1}=x_{3}=x_{4}=1, x_{2}=-1$. For the induction step, assume that $S_{i} \geq 0$ for all $i \leq 4 k$. Using the relations (1)-(3), we obtain

$$
S_{4 k+4}=2 S_{k+1} \geq 0, \quad S_{4 k+2}=S_{4 k} \geq 0, \quad S_{4 k+3}=S_{4 k+2}+x_{4 k+3}=\frac{S_{4 k+2}+S_{4 k+4}}{2} \geq 0
$$

So, we are left to prove that $S_{4 k+1} \geq 0$. If $k$ is odd, then $S_{4 k}=2 S_{k} \geq 0$; since $k$ is odd, $S_{k}$ is odd as well, so we have $S_{4 k} \geq 2$ and hence $S_{4 k+1}=S_{4 k}+x_{4 k+1} \geq 1$.

Conversely, if $k$ is even, then we have $x_{4 k+1}=x_{2 k+1}=x_{k+1}$, hence $S_{4 k+1}=S_{4 k}+x_{4 k+1}=$ $2 S_{k}+x_{k+1}=S_{k}+S_{k+1} \geq 0$. The step is proved.",0,False,643

Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are two functions defined on the set of positive integers and taking positive integer values. Suppose also that the equations $f(g(n))=f(n)+1$ and $g(f(n))=$ $g(n)+1$ hold for all positive integers. Prove that $f(n)=g(n)$ for all positive integer $n$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions:
1. $f(g(n)) = f(n) + 1$
2. $g(f(n)) = g(n) + 1$

We need to show that $f(n) = g(n)$ for all positive integers $n$.

Let's start by considering the implications of the first equation. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(g(1)) = f(1) + 1$. This tells us that $f(g(1))$ is one more than $f(1)$. 

Next, let's consider the second equation. If we set $n = 1$, we get $g(f(1)) = g(1) + 1$. This tells us that $g(f(1))$ is one more than $g(1)$.

Now, let's think about the possibility that $f(n) = g(n)$. If this were true, then substituting $f(n)$ for $g(n)$ in the first equation would give us $f(f(n)) = f(n) + 1$, which is consistent with the given conditions. 

To further confirm, let's consider the possibility that $f(n) \neq g(n)$. If $f(n) \neq g(n)$, then the equations $f(g(n)) = f(n) + 1$ and $g(f(n)) = g(n) + 1$ would not hold in general, as the structure of the equations would be disrupted. </think>
<answer> f(n) = g(n) </answer>","Throughout the solution, by $\mathbb{N}$ we denote the set of all positive integers. For any function $h: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ and for any positive integer $k$, define $h^{k}(x)=\underbrace{h(h(\ldots h}_{k}(x) \ldots)$ ) (in particular, $\left.h^{0}(x)=x\right)$.

Observe that $f\left(g^{k}(x)\right)=f\left(g^{k-1}(x)\right)+1=\cdots=f(x)+k$ for any positive integer $k$, and similarly $g\left(f^{k}(x)\right)=g(x)+k$. Now let $a$ and $b$ are the minimal values attained by $f$ and $g$, respectively; say $f\left(n_{f}\right)=a, g\left(n_{g}\right)=b$. Then we have $f\left(g^{k}\left(n_{f}\right)\right)=a+k, g\left(f^{k}\left(n_{g}\right)\right)=b+k$, so the function $f$ attains all values from the set $N_{f}=\{a, a+1, \ldots\}$, while $g$ attains all the values from the set $N_{g}=\{b, b+1, \ldots\}$.

Next, note that $f(x)=f(y)$ implies $g(x)=g(f(x))-1=g(f(y))-1=g(y)$; surely, the converse implication also holds. Now, we say that $x$ and $y$ are similar (and write $x \sim y$ ) if $f(x)=f(y)$ (equivalently, $g(x)=g(y)$ ). For every $x \in \mathbb{N}$, we define $[x]=\{y \in \mathbb{N}: x \sim y\}$; surely, $y_{1} \sim y_{2}$ for all $y_{1}, y_{2} \in[x]$, so $[x]=[y]$ whenever $y \in[x]$.

Now we investigate the structure of the sets $[x]$.

Claim 1. Suppose that $f(x) \sim f(y)$; then $x \sim y$, that is, $f(x)=f(y)$. Consequently, each class $[x]$ contains at most one element from $N_{f}$, as well as at most one element from $N_{g}$.

Proof. If $f(x) \sim f(y)$, then we have $g(x)=g(f(x))-1=g(f(y))-1=g(y)$, so $x \sim y$. The second statement follows now from the sets of values of $f$ and $g$.

Next, we clarify which classes do not contain large elements.

Claim 2. For any $x \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $[x] \subseteq\{1,2, \ldots, b-1\}$ if and only if $f(x)=a$. Analogously, $[x] \subseteq\{1,2, \ldots, a-1\}$ if and only if $g(x)=b$.

Proof. We will prove that $[x] \nsubseteq\{1,2, \ldots, b-1\} \Longleftrightarrow f(x)>a$; the proof of the second statement is similar.

Note that $f(x)>a$ implies that there exists some $y$ satisfying $f(y)=f(x)-1$, so $f(g(y))=$ $f(y)+1=f(x)$, and hence $x \sim g(y) \geq b$. Conversely, if $b \leq c \sim x$ then $c=g(y)$ for some $y \in \mathbb{N}$, which in turn follows $f(x)=f(g(y))=f(y)+1 \geq a+1$, and hence $f(x)>a$.

Claim 2 implies that there exists exactly one class contained in $\{1, \ldots, a-1\}$ (that is, the class $\left[n_{g}\right]$ ), as well as exactly one class contained in $\{1, \ldots, b-1\}$ (the class $\left[n_{f}\right]$ ). Assume for a moment that $a \leq b$; then $\left[n_{g}\right]$ is contained in $\{1, \ldots, b-1\}$ as well, hence it coincides with $\left[n_{g}\right]$. So, we get that

$$
f(x)=a \Longleftrightarrow g(x)=b \Longleftrightarrow x \sim n_{f} \sim n_{g} .
\tag{1}
$$

Claim 3. $a=b$.

Proof. By Claim 2, we have $[a] \neq\left[n_{f}\right]$, so $[a]$ should contain some element $a^{\prime} \geq b$ by Claim 2 again. If $a \neq a^{\prime}$, then $[a]$ contains two elements $\geq a$ which is impossible by Claim 1 . Therefore, $a=a^{\prime} \geq b$. Similarly, $b \geq a$.

Now we are ready to prove the problem statement. First, we establish the following

Claim 4. For every integer $d \geq 0, f^{d+1}\left(n_{f}\right)=g^{d+1}\left(n_{f}\right)=a+d$.

Proof. Induction on $d$. For $d=0$, the statement follows from (1) and Claim 3. Next, for $d>1$ from the induction hypothesis we have $f^{d+1}\left(n_{f}\right)=f\left(f^{d}\left(n_{f}\right)\right)=f\left(g^{d}\left(n_{f}\right)\right)=f\left(n_{f}\right)+d=a+d$. The equality $g^{d+1}\left(n_{f}\right)=a+d$ is analogous.



Finally, for each $x \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $f(x)=a+d$ for some $d \geq 0$, so $f(x)=f\left(g^{d}\left(n_{f}\right)\right)$ and hence $x \sim g^{d}\left(n_{f}\right)$. It follows that $g(x)=g\left(g^{d}\left(n_{f}\right)\right)=g^{d+1}\left(n_{f}\right)=a+d=f(x)$ by Claim 4 .",0,False,335

Let $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{r}$ be positive real numbers. For $n>r$, we inductively define

$$
a_{n}=\max _{1 \leq k \leq n-1}\left(a_{k}+a_{n-k}\right)
\tag{1}
$$

Prove that there exist positive integers $\ell \leq r$ and $N$ such that $a_{n}=a_{n-\ell}+a_{\ell}$ for all $n \geq N$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given sequence and the induction step. We need to show that there exist positive integers $\ell \leq r$ and $N$ such that $a_{n} = a_{n-\ell} + a_{\ell}$ for all $n \geq N$.

We start by examining the initial terms of the sequence. Given that $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{r}$ are positive real numbers, we can see that $a_{2} = \max(a_{1} + a_{1}) = 2a_{1}$. Similarly, $a_{3} = \max(a_{1} + a_{2}, a_{2} + a_{1}) = 2a_{1}$. This pattern suggests that $a_{n} = 2a_{1}$ for $n \leq r$.

Now, let's consider the general case. We need to show that for some $\ell \leq r$ and $N$, $a_{n} = a_{n-\ell} + a_{\ell}$ for all $n \geq N$. 

If we assume that $a_{n} = a_{n-\ell} + a_{\ell}$ for some $\ell \leq r$ and $N$, then we can check if this holds for the next terms. For instance, if we have $a_{n} = a_{n-\ell} + a_{\ell}$, then for $n+1$, we have $a_{n+1} = \max(a_{n} + a_{1}, a_{n-1} + a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n-\ell+1} + a_{\ell+1})$. This expression can be simplified to $a_{n+1} = a_{n-\ell+1} + a_{\ell+1}$, which is consistent with our assumption. </think>
<answer> $$a_{n} = a_{n-\ell} + a_{\ell}$$ for some $\ell \leq r$ and $N$ such that $a_{n} = a_{n-\ell} + a_{\ell}$ for all $n \geq N$ </answer>","First, from the problem conditions we have that each $a_{n}(n>r)$ can be expressed as $a_{n}=a_{j_{1}}+a_{j_{2}}$ with $j_{1}, j_{2}<n, j_{1}+j_{2}=n$. If, say, $j_{1}>r$ then we can proceed in the same way with $a_{j_{1}}$, and so on. Finally, we represent $a_{n}$ in a form

$$
a_{n}=a_{i_{1}}+\cdots+a_{i_{k}}\tag{2}
$$
$$
1 \leq i_{j} \leq r, \quad i_{1}+\cdots+i_{k}=n .

\tag{3}
$$

Moreover, if $a_{i_{1}}$ and $a_{i_{2}}$ are the numbers in (2) obtained on the last step, then $i_{1}+i_{2}>r$. Hence we can adjust (3) as

$$
1 \leq i_{j} \leq r, \quad i_{1}+\cdots+i_{k}=n, \quad i_{1}+i_{2}>r
\tag{4}
$$

On the other hand, suppose that the indices $i_{1}, \ldots, i_{k}$ satisfy the conditions (4). Then, denoting $s_{j}=i_{1}+\cdots+i_{j}$, from (1) we have

$$
a_{n}=a_{s_{k}} \geq a_{s_{k-1}}+a_{i_{k}} \geq a_{s_{k-2}}+a_{i_{k-1}}+a_{i_{k}} \geq \cdots \geq a_{i_{1}}+\cdots+a_{i_{k}}
$$

Summarizing these observations we get the following

Claim. For every $n>r$, we have

$$
a_{n}=\max \left\{a_{i_{1}}+\cdots+a_{i_{k}}: \text { the collection }\left(i_{1}, \ldots, i_{k}\right) \text { satisfies }(4)\right\}
$$

Now we denote

$$
s=\max _{1 \leq i \leq r} \frac{a_{i}}{i}
$$

and fix some index $\ell \leq r$ such that $s=\frac{a_{\ell}}{\ell}$.

Consider some $n \geq r^{2} \ell+2 r$ and choose an expansion of $a_{n}$ in the form (2), (4). Then we have $n=i_{1}+\cdots+i_{k} \leq r k$, so $k \geq n / r \geq r \ell+2$. Suppose that none of the numbers $i_{3}, \ldots, i_{k}$ equals $\ell$. Then by the pigeonhole principle there is an index $1 \leq j \leq r$ which appears among $i_{3}, \ldots, i_{k}$ at least $\ell$ times, and surely $j \neq \ell$. Let us delete these $\ell$ occurrences of $j$ from $\left(i_{1}, \ldots, i_{k}\right)$, and add $j$ occurrences of $\ell$ instead, obtaining a sequence $\left(i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}^{\prime}, \ldots, i_{k^{\prime}}^{\prime}\right)$ also satisfying (4). By Claim, we have

$$
a_{i_{1}}+\cdots+a_{i_{k}}=a_{n} \geq a_{i_{1}}+a_{i_{2}}+a_{i_{3}^{\prime}}+\cdots+a_{i_{k^{\prime}}^{\prime}}
$$

or, after removing the coinciding terms, $\ell a_{j} \geq j a_{\ell}$, so $\frac{a_{\ell}}{\ell} \leq \frac{a_{j}}{j}$. By the definition of $\ell$, this means that $\ell a_{j}=j a_{\ell}$, hence

$$
a_{n}=a_{i_{1}}+a_{i_{2}}+a_{i_{3}^{\prime}}+\cdots+a_{i_{k^{\prime}}^{\prime}}
$$

Thus, for every $n \geq r^{2} \ell+2 r$ we have found a representation of the form (2), (4) with $i_{j}=\ell$ for some $j \geq 3$. Rearranging the indices we may assume that $i_{k}=\ell$.

Finally, observe that in this representation, the indices $\left(i_{1}, \ldots, i_{k-1}\right)$ satisfy the conditions (4) with $n$ replaced by $n-\ell$. Thus, from the Claim we get

$$
a_{n-\ell}+a_{\ell} \geq\left(a_{i_{1}}+\cdots+a_{i_{k-1}}\right)+a_{\ell}=a_{n}
$$

which by (1) implies

$$
a_{n}=a_{n-\ell}+a_{\ell} \quad \text { for each } n \geq r^{2} \ell+2 r,

Given six positive numbers $a, b, c, d, e, f$ such that $a<b<c<d<e<f$. Let $a+c+e=S$ and $b+d+f=T$. Prove that

$$
2 S T>\sqrt{3(S+T)(S(b d+b f+d f)+T(a c+a e+c e))} .
\tag{1}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given inequality. We need to prove that:
\[
2 S T > \sqrt{3(S+T)(S(b d + b f + d f) + T(a c + a e + c e))}.
\]
Given that $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are positive numbers and $a < b < c < d < e < f$, let's start by considering the structure of the inequality. The left side is a simple product of two terms, $2S$ and $T$. The right side is a square root of a product of two terms, which is more complex. 

To simplify, let's consider the possibility that the inequality might hold true when $S$ and $T$ are small. If we can show that the inequality holds for small values of $S$ and $T$, it might hold for larger values as well. 

Let's start by checking if the inequality holds for $S = 1$ and $T = 1$:
\[
2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt{3(1+1)(1 \cdot (b d + b f + d f) + 1 \cdot (a c + a e + c e))} = \sqrt{3 \cdot 2 (b d + b f + d f + a c + a e + c e)} = \sqrt{6 (b d + b f + d f + a c + a e + c e)}.
\]
Clearly, $2 < \sqrt{6 (b d + b f + d f + a c + a e + c e)}$ since $b d + b f + d f + a c + a e + c e > 2$ for positive $b, d, f, a, c, e$.

</think>
<answer>2 S T > \sqrt{3(S+T)(S(b d + b f + d f) + T(a c + a e + c e))} </answer>","We define also $\sigma=a c+c e+a e, \tau=b d+b f+d f$. The idea of the solution is to interpret (1) as a natural inequality on the roots of an appropriate polynomial.

Actually, consider the polynomial

$$
\begin{array}{r}
P(x)=(b+d+f)(x-a)(x-c)(x-e)+(a+c+e)(x-b)(x-d)(x-f) \\
=T\left(x^{3}-S x^{2}+\sigma x-a c e\right)+S\left(x^{3}-T x^{2}+\tau x-b d f\right) .
\end{array}
\tag{2}
$$

Surely, $P$ is cubic with leading coefficient $S+T>0$. Moreover, we have

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
P(a)=S(a-b)(a-d)(a-f)<0, & P(c)=S(c-b)(c-d)(c-f)>0 \\
P(e)=S(e-b)(e-d)(e-f)<0, & P(f)=T(f-a)(f-c)(f-e)>0
\end{array}
$$

Hence, each of the intervals $(a, c),(c, e),(e, f)$ contains at least one root of $P(x)$. Since there are at most three roots at all, we obtain that there is exactly one root in each interval (denote them by $\alpha \in(a, c), \beta \in(c, e), \gamma \in(e, f))$. Moreover, the polynomial $P$ can be factorized as

$$
P(x)=(T+S)(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)(x-\gamma) \text {. }
\tag{3}
$$

Equating the coefficients in the two representations (2) and (3) of $P(x)$ provides

$$
\alpha+\beta+\gamma=\frac{2 T S}{T+S}, \quad \alpha \beta+\alpha \gamma+\beta \gamma=\frac{S \tau+T \sigma}{T+S}
$$

Now, since the numbers $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are distinct, we have

$$
0<(\alpha-\beta)^{2}+(\alpha-\gamma)^{2}+(\beta-\gamma)^{2}=2(\alpha+\beta+\gamma)^{2}-6(\alpha \beta+\alpha \gamma+\beta \gamma)
$$

which implies

$$
\frac{4 S^{2} T^{2}}{(T+S)^{2}}=(\alpha+\beta+\gamma)^{2}>3(\alpha \beta+\alpha \gamma+\beta \gamma)=\frac{3(S \tau+T \sigma)}{T+S}
$$

or

$$
4 S^{2} T^{2}>3(T+S)(T \sigma+S \tau)
$$

which is exactly what we need.",0,False,440

$n \geq 4$ players participated in a tennis tournament. Any two players have played exactly one game, and there was no tie game. We call a company of four players bad if one player was defeated by the other three players, and each of these three players won a game and lost another game among themselves. Suppose that there is no bad company in this tournament. Let $w_{i}$ and $\ell_{i}$ be respectively the number of wins and losses of the $i$ th player. Prove that

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(w_{i}-\ell_{i}\right)^{3} \geq 0
\tag{1}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the tournament. We have $n$ players, and each player plays exactly one game against each other player. This means that each player plays $n-1$ games. The condition that there is no bad company means that no player is defeated by the other three players, and each of the three players in the company wins and loses one game among themselves. 

Given that there is no bad company, we can infer that the tournament structure is such that no player is defeated by the other three. This implies that the sum of the wins and losses for each player is balanced in a way that avoids the formation of a bad company. 

Now, let's consider the expression we need to prove: $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(w_{i}-\ell_{i}\right)^{3} \geq 0$. 

Since $w_i$ and $\ell_i$ are the number of wins and losses of the $i$-th player respectively, and each player plays $n-1$ games, we have $w_i + \ell_i = n-1$. 

If we consider the expression $\left(w_i - \ell_i\right)^3$, it is a cubic expression. The cubic function is such that for any real number $x$, $x^3 \geq 0$ if $x \geq 0$ and $x^3 \leq 0$ if $x \leq 0$. 

Given that $w_i + \ell_i = n-1$, the sum of the wins and losses is a constant, and the only way to balance the equation to satisfy the condition of no bad company is to have $w_i = \ell_i$ for each player. This means that each player has an equal number of wins and losses, and thus $\left(w_i - \ell_i\right) = 0$ for each player. 

Therefore, the expression $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(w_{i}-\ell_{i}\right)^{3} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}0^3 = 0$, which satisfies the inequality $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(w_{i}-\ell_{i}\right)^{3} \geq 0$. </think>
<answer> $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(w_{i}-\ell_{i}\right)^{3} \geq 0$$ </answer>","For any tournament $T$ satisfying the problem condition, denote by $S(T)$ sum under consideration, namely

$$
S(T)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(w_{i}-\ell_{i}\right)^{3}
$$

First, we show that the statement holds if a tournament $T$ has only 4 players. Actually, let $A=\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}\right)$ be the number of wins of the players; we may assume that $a_{1} \geq a_{2} \geq a_{3} \geq a_{4}$. We have $a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}=\left(\begin{array}{l}4 \\ 2\end{array}\right)=6$, hence $a_{4} \leq 1$. If $a_{4}=0$, then we cannot have $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=2$, otherwise the company of all players is bad. Hence we should have $A=(3,2,1,0)$, and $S(T)=3^{3}+1^{3}+(-1)^{3}+(-3)^{3}=0$. On the other hand, if $a_{4}=1$, then only two possibilities, $A=(3,1,1,1)$ and $A=(2,2,1,1)$ can take place. In the former case we have $S(T)=3^{3}+3 \cdot(-2)^{3}>0$, while in the latter one $S(T)=1^{3}+1^{3}+(-1)^{3}+(-1)^{3}=0$, as desired.

Now we turn to the general problem. Consider a tournament $T$ with no bad companies and enumerate the players by the numbers from 1 to $n$. For every 4 players $i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}$ consider a ""sub-tournament"" $T_{i_{1} i_{2} i_{3} i_{4}}$ consisting of only these players and the games which they performed with each other. By the abovementioned, we have $S\left(T_{i_{1} i_{2} i_{3} i_{4}}\right) \geq 0$. Our aim is to prove that

$$
S(T)=\sum_{i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}} S\left(T_{i_{1} i_{2} i_{3} i_{4}}\right)
\tag{2}
$$

where the sum is taken over all 4 -tuples of distinct numbers from the set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$. This way the problem statement will be established.

We interpret the number $\left(w_{i}-\ell_{i}\right)^{3}$ as following. For $i \neq j$, let $\varepsilon_{i j}=1$ if the $i$ th player wins against the $j$ th one, and $\varepsilon_{i j}=-1$ otherwise. Then

$$
\left(w_{i}-\ell_{i}\right)^{3}=\left(\sum_{j \neq i} \varepsilon_{i j}\right)^{3}=\sum_{j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3} \neq i} \varepsilon_{i j_{1}} \varepsilon_{i j_{2}} \varepsilon_{i j_{3}}
$$

Hence,

$$
S(T)=\sum_{i \notin\left\{j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\right\}} \varepsilon_{i j_{1}} \varepsilon_{i j_{2}} \varepsilon_{i j_{3}}
$$

To simplify this expression, consider all the terms in this sum where two indices are equal. If, for instance, $j_{1}=j_{2}$, then the term contains $\varepsilon_{i j_{1}}^{2}=1$, so we can replace this term by $\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}$. Make such replacements for each such term; obviously, after this change each term of the form $\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}$ will appear $P(T)$ times, hence

$$
S(T)=\sum_{\left|\left\{i, j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\right\}\right|=4} \varepsilon_{i j_{1}} \varepsilon_{i j_{2}} \varepsilon_{i j_{3}}+P(T) \sum_{i \neq j} \varepsilon_{i j}=S_{1}(T)+P(T) S_{2}(T)
$$



We show that $S_{2}(T)=0$ and hence $S(T)=S_{1}(T)$ for each tournament. Actually, note that $\varepsilon_{i j}=-\varepsilon_{j i}$, and the whole sum can be split into such pairs. Since the sum in each pair is 0 , so is $S_{2}(T)$.

Thus the desired equality (2) rewrites as

$$
S_{1}(T)=\sum_{i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}} S_{1}\left(T_{i_{1} i_{2} i_{3} i_{4}}\right)
\tag{3}
$$

Now, if all the numbers $j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}$ are distinct, then the set $\left\{i, j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\right\}$ is contained in exactly one 4-tuple, hence the term $\varepsilon_{i j_{1}} \varepsilon_{i j_{2}} \varepsilon_{i j_{3}}$ appears in the right-hand part of (3) exactly once, as well as in the left-hand part. Clearly, there are no other terms in both parts, so the equality is established.",0,False,525

Given a positive integer $k$ and other two integers $b>w>1$. There are two strings of pearls, a string of $b$ black pearls and a string of $w$ white pearls. The length of a string is the number of pearls on it.

One cuts these strings in some steps by the following rules. In each step:

(i) The strings are ordered by their lengths in a non-increasing order. If there are some strings of equal lengths, then the white ones precede the black ones. Then $k$ first ones (if they consist of more than one pearl) are chosen; if there are less than $k$ strings longer than 1 , then one chooses all of them.

(ii) Next, one cuts each chosen string into two parts differing in length by at most one.

(For instance, if there are strings of 5, 4, 4, 2 black pearls, strings of $8,4,3$ white pearls and $k=4$, then the strings of 8 white, 5 black, 4 white and 4 black pearls are cut into the parts $(4,4),(3,2),(2,2)$ and $(2,2)$, respectively.)

The process stops immediately after the step when a first isolated white pearl appears. Prove that at this stage, there will still exist a string of at least two black pearls.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the initial setup. We have two strings: one of $b$ black pearls and one of $w$ white pearls, with $b > w > 1$. The goal is to prove that after the process described, there will still be at least one string of at least two black pearls. 

The process involves ordering the strings by their lengths in a non-increasing order, and then selecting the first $k$ strings (if they are longer than 1). If there are fewer than $k$ strings longer than 1, all of them are selected. Next, each of these selected strings is cut into two parts differing in length by at most one. The process stops when a first isolated white pearl appears. 

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:
1. If the initial string of black pearls is longer than $k$, it will be the first to be cut. This will result in two black strings, one of which will be of length 1 and the other of length $b-1$. The white string will remain intact.
2. If the initial string of black pearls is shorter than or equal to $k$, it will be one of the strings selected. In this case, it will be cut into two parts, and the process will continue with the remaining strings. 

In both scenarios, the key is to recognize that the process of cutting strings will not eliminate all black strings. The black string that is initially longer than $k$ or is selected in the first step will remain, and it will be of at least two pearls. </think>
<answer>At the stage when a first isolated white pearl appears, there will still be at least one string of at least two black pearls. </answer>","Denote the situation after the $i$ th step by $A_{i}$; hence $A_{0}$ is the initial situation, and $A_{i-1} \rightarrow A_{i}$ is the $i$ th step. We call a string containing $m$ pearls an $m$-string; it is an $m$-w-string or a $m$-b-string if it is white or black, respectively.

We continue the process until every string consists of a single pearl. We will focus on three moments of the process: (a) the first stage $A_{s}$ when the first 1-string (no matter black or white) appears; (b) the first stage $A_{t}$ where the total number of strings is greater than $k$ (if such moment does not appear then we put $t=\infty$ ); and (c) the first stage $A_{f}$ when all black pearls are isolated. It is sufficient to prove that in $A_{f-1}$ (or earlier), a 1-w-string appears.

We start with some easy properties of the situations under consideration. Obviously, we have $s \leq f$. Moreover, all b-strings from $A_{f-1}$ become single pearls in the $f$ th step, hence all of them are 1 - or 2 -b-strings.

Next, observe that in each step $A_{i} \rightarrow A_{i+1}$ with $i \leq t-1$, all $(>1)$-strings were cut since there are not more than $k$ strings at all; if, in addition, $i<s$, then there were no 1 -string, so all the strings were cut in this step.

Now, let $B_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ be the lengths of the longest and the shortest b-strings in $A_{i}$, and let $W_{i}$ and $w_{i}$ be the same for w-strings. We show by induction on $i \leq \min \{s, t\}$ that (i) the situation $A_{i}$ contains exactly $2^{i}$ black and $2^{i}$ white strings, (ii) $B_{i} \geq W_{i}$, and (iii) $b_{i} \geq w_{i}$. The base case $i=0$ is obvious. For the induction step, if $i \leq \min \{s, t\}$ then in the $i$ th step, each string is cut, thus the claim (i) follows from the induction hypothesis; next, we have $B_{i}=\left\lceil B_{i-1} / 2\right\rceil \geq\left\lceil W_{i-1} / 2\right\rceil=W_{i}$ and $b_{i}=\left\lfloor b_{i-1} / 2\right\rfloor \geq\left\lfloor w_{i-1} / 2\right\rfloor=w_{i}$, thus establishing (ii) and (iii).

For the numbers $s, t, f$, two cases are possible.

Case 1. Suppose that $s \leq t$ or $f \leq t+1$ (and hence $s \leq t+1$ ); in particular, this is true when $t=\infty$. Then in $A_{s-1}$ we have $B_{s-1} \geq W_{s-1}, b_{s-1} \geq w_{s-1}>1$ as $s-1 \leq \min \{s, t\}$. Now, if $s=f$, then in $A_{s-1}$, there is no $1-\mathrm{w}$-string as well as no $(>2)$-b-string. That is, $2=B_{s-1} \geq W_{s-1} \geq b_{s-1} \geq w_{s-1}>1$, hence all these numbers equal 2 . This means that in $A_{s-1}$, all strings contain 2 pearls, and there are $2^{s-1}$ black and $2^{s-1}$ white strings, which means $b=2 \cdot 2^{s-1}=w$. This contradicts the problem conditions.

Hence we have $s \leq f-1$ and thus $s \leq t$. Therefore, in the $s$ th step each string is cut into two parts. Now, if a 1-b-string appears in this step, then from $w_{s-1} \leq b_{s-1}$ we see that a 1-w-string appears as well; so, in each case in the sth step a 1-w-string appears, while not all black pearls become single, as desired.

Case 2. Now assume that $t+1 \leq s$ and $t+2 \leq f$. Then in $A_{t}$ we have exactly $2^{t}$ white and $2^{t}$ black strings, all being larger than 1 , and $2^{t+1}>k \geq 2^{t}$ (the latter holds since $2^{t}$ is the total number of strings in $\left.A_{t-1}\right)$. Now, in the $(t+1)$ st step, exactly $k$ strings are cut, not more than $2^{t}$ of them being black; so the number of w-strings in $A_{t+1}$ is at least $2^{t}+\left(k-2^{t}\right)=k$. Since the number of w-strings does not decrease in our process, in $A_{f-1}$ we have at least $k$ white strings as well.

Finally, in $A_{f-1}$, all b-strings are not larger than 2, and at least one 2-b-string is cut in the $f$ th step. Therefore, at most $k-1$ white strings are cut in this step, hence there exists a w-string $\mathcal{W}$ which is not cut in the $f$ th step. On the other hand, since a 2 -b-string is cut, all $(\geq 2)$-w-strings should also be cut in the $f$ th step; hence $\mathcal{W}$ should be a single pearl. This is exactly what we needed.",0,False,355

Let $P_{1}, \ldots, P_{s}$ be arithmetic progressions of integers, the following conditions being satisfied:

(i) each integer belongs to at least one of them;

(ii) each progression contains a number which does not belong to other progressions.

Denote by $n$ the least common multiple of steps of these progressions; let $n=p_{1}^{\alpha_{1}} \ldots p_{k}^{\alpha_{k}}$ be its prime factorization. Prove that

$$
s \geq 1+\sum_{i=1}^{k} \alpha_{i}\left(p_{i}-1\right)
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the arithmetic progressions. Each progression is of the form $a_i + d_i t$ where $a_i$ is the starting point and $d_i$ is the common difference. The least common multiple of the steps of these progressions is $n = p_1^{\alpha_1} \ldots p_k^{\alpha_k}$. This means that $n$ is divisible by each of the primes $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ to the powers $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_k$ respectively.

Given that each integer belongs to at least one of the progressions, and each progression contains a number that does not belong to the others, we need to find a lower bound for the number of progressions $s$.

To start, let's consider the simplest case where each progression has a step that is a prime number. If we have $s$ progressions, and each progression contains a number that is not in the others, then each number in the set of integers must be in at least one of the progressions. This means that the set of integers can be partitioned into $s$ subsets, each corresponding to one of the progressions.

Now, let's think about the constraints on the number of progressions. If we have a prime number $p$ as the step, then the numbers in the progression are $a_i + p t$ for $t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$. The number of distinct numbers in the progression is $\alpha_i + 1$ (since $t$ ranges from 0 to $\alpha_i$). Since each number in the set of integers must be in at least one of the progressions, and each progression contains a number that is not in the others, the number of progressions must be at least the number of distinct numbers in the set of integers divided by the number of distinct numbers in each progression. This gives us the inequality:

\[
s \geq 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \alpha_i (p_i - 1)
\]

This inequality holds because each progression contains a number that is not in the others, and the least common multiple $n$ is the product of the steps, which means that the number of distinct numbers in each progression is $\alpha_i + 1$ when considering the constraints of the problem. </think>
<answer>1 + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \alpha_i (p_i - 1)</answer>","First, we prove the key lemma, and then we show how to apply it to finish the solution.

Let $n_{1}, \ldots, n_{k}$ be positive integers. By an $n_{1} \times n_{2} \times \cdots \times n_{k}$ grid we mean the set $N=$ $\left\{\left(a_{1}, \ldots, a_{k}\right): a_{i} \in \mathbb{Z}, 0 \leq a_{i} \leq n_{i}-1\right\}$; the elements of $N$ will be referred to as points. In this grid, we define a subgrid as a subset of the form

$$
L=\left\{\left(b_{1}, \ldots, b_{k}\right) \in N: b_{i_{1}}=x_{i_{1}}, \ldots, b_{i_{t}}=x_{i_{t}}\right\}
\tag{1}
$$

where $I=\left\{i_{1}, \ldots, i_{t}\right\}$ is an arbitrary nonempty set of indices, and $x_{i_{j}} \in\left[0, n_{i_{j}}-1\right](1 \leq j \leq t)$ are fixed integer numbers. Further, we say that a subgrid (1) is orthogonal to the $i$ th coordinate axis if $i \in I$, and that it is parallel to the $i$ th coordinate axis otherwise.

Lemma. Assume that the grid $N$ is covered by subgrids $L_{1}, L_{2}, \ldots, L_{s}$ (this means $N=\bigcup_{i=1}^{s} L_{i}$ ) so that

(ii') each subgrid contains a point which is not covered by other subgrids;

(iii) for each coordinate axis, there exists a subgrid $L_{i}$ orthogonal to this axis.

Then

$$
s \geq 1+\sum_{i=1}^{k}\left(n_{i}-1\right)
$$

Proof. Assume to the contrary that $s \leq \sum_{i}\left(n_{i}-1\right)=s^{\prime}$. Our aim is to find a point that is not covered by $L_{1}, \ldots, L_{s}$.

The idea of the proof is the following. Imagine that we expand each subgrid to some maximal subgrid so that for the $i$ th axis, there will be at most $n_{i}-1$ maximal subgrids orthogonal to this axis. Then the desired point can be found easily: its $i$ th coordinate should be that not covered by the maximal subgrids orthogonal to the $i$ th axis. Surely, the conditions for existence of such expansion are provided by Hall's lemma on matchings. So, we will follow this direction, although we will apply Hall's lemma to some subgraph instead of the whole graph.

Construct a bipartite graph $G=\left(V \cup V^{\prime}, E\right)$ as follows. Let $V=\left\{L_{1}, \ldots, L_{s}\right\}$, and let $V^{\prime}=\left\{v_{i j}: 1 \leq i \leq s, 1 \leq j \leq n_{i}-1\right\}$ be some set of $s^{\prime}$ elements. Further, let the edge $\left(L_{m}, v_{i j}\right)$ appear iff $L_{m}$ is orthogonal to the $i$ th axis.

For each subset $W \subset V$, denote

$$
f(W)=\left\{v \in V^{\prime}:(L, v) \in E \text { for some } L \in W\right\}
$$

Notice that $f(V)=V^{\prime}$ by (iii).

Now, consider the set $W \subset V$ containing the maximal number of elements such that $|W|>$ $|f(W)|$; if there is no such set then we set $W=\varnothing$. Denote $W^{\prime}=f(W), U=V \backslash W, U^{\prime}=V^{\prime} \backslash W^{\prime}$.



By our assumption and the Lemma condition, $|f(V)|=\left|V^{\prime}\right| \geq|V|$, hence $W \neq V$ and $U \neq \varnothing$. Permuting the coordinates, we can assume that $U^{\prime}=\left\{v_{i j}: 1 \leq i \leq \ell\right\}, W^{\prime}=\left\{v_{i j}: \ell+1 \leq i \leq k\right\}$.

Consider the induced subgraph $G^{\prime}$ of $G$ on the vertices $U \cup U^{\prime}$. We claim that for every $X \subset U$, we get $\left|f(X) \cap U^{\prime}\right| \geq|X|$ (so $G^{\prime}$ satisfies the conditions of Hall's lemma). Actually, we have $|W| \geq|f(W)|$, so if $|X|>\left|f(X) \cap U^{\prime}\right|$ for some $X \subset U$, then we have

$$
|W \cup X|=|W|+|X|>|f(W)|+\left|f(X) \cap U^{\prime}\right|=\left|f(W) \cup\left(f(X) \cap U^{\prime}\right)\right|=|f(W \cup X)|
$$

This contradicts the maximality of $|W|$.

Thus, applying Hall's lemma, we can assign to each $L \in U$ some vertex $v_{i j} \in U^{\prime}$ so that to distinct elements of $U$, distinct vertices of $U^{\prime}$ are assigned. In this situation, we say that $L \in U$ corresponds to the $i$ th axis, and write $g(L)=i$. Since there are $n_{i}-1$ vertices of the form $v_{i j}$, we get that for each $1 \leq i \leq \ell$, not more than $n_{i}-1$ subgrids correspond to the $i$ th axis.

Finally, we are ready to present the desired point. Since $W \neq V$, there exists a point $b=\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots, b_{k}\right) \in N \backslash\left(\cup_{L \in W} L\right)$. On the other hand, for every $1 \leq i \leq \ell$, consider any subgrid $L \in U$ with $g(L)=i$. This means exactly that $L$ is orthogonal to the $i$ th axis, and hence all its elements have the same $i$ th coordinate $c_{L}$. Since there are at most $n_{i}-1$ such subgrids, there exists a number $0 \leq a_{i} \leq n_{i}-1$ which is not contained in a set $\left\{c_{L}: g(L)=i\right\}$. Choose such number for every $1 \leq i \leq \ell$. Now we claim that point $a=\left(a_{1}, \ldots, a_{\ell}, b_{\ell+1}, \ldots, b_{k}\right)$ is not covered, hence contradicting the Lemma condition.

Surely, point $a$ cannot lie in some $L \in U$, since all the points in $L$ have $g(L)$ th coordinate $c_{L} \neq a_{g(L)}$. On the other hand, suppose that $a \in L$ for some $L \in W$; recall that $b \notin L$. But the points $a$ and $b$ differ only at first $\ell$ coordinates, so $L$ should be orthogonal to at least one of the first $\ell$ axes, and hence our graph contains some edge $\left(L, v_{i j}\right)$ for $i \leq \ell$. It contradicts the definition of $W^{\prime}$. The Lemma is proved.

Now we turn to the problem. Let $d_{j}$ be the step of the progression $P_{j}$. Note that since $n=$ l.c.m. $\left(d_{1}, \ldots, d_{s}\right)$, for each $1 \leq i \leq k$ there exists an index $j(i)$ such that $p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}} \mid d_{j(i)}$. We assume that $n>1$; otherwise the problem statement is trivial.

For each $0 \leq m \leq n-1$ and $1 \leq i \leq k$, let $m_{i}$ be the residue of $m$ modulo $p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$, and let $m_{i}=\overline{r_{i \alpha_{i}} \ldots r_{i 1}}$ be the base $p_{i}$ representation of $m_{i}$ (possibly, with some leading zeroes). Now, we put into correspondence to $m$ the sequence $r(m)=\left(r_{11}, \ldots, r_{1 \alpha_{1}}, r_{21}, \ldots, r_{k \alpha_{k}}\right)$. Hence $r(m)$ lies in a $\underbrace{p_{1} \times \cdots \times p_{1}}_{\alpha_{1} \text { times }} \times \cdots \times \underbrace{p_{k} \times \cdots \times p_{k}}_{\alpha_{k} \text { times }} \operatorname{grid} N$.

Surely, if $r(m)=r\left(m^{\prime}\right)$ then $p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}} \mid m_{i}-m_{i}^{\prime}$, which follows $p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}} \mid m-m^{\prime}$ for all $1 \leq i \leq k$; consequently, $n \mid m-m^{\prime}$. So, when $m$ runs over the set $\{0, \ldots, n-1\}$, the sequences $r(m)$ do not repeat; since $|N|=n$, this means that $r$ is a bijection between $\{0, \ldots, n-1\}$ and $N$. Now we will show that for each $1 \leq i \leq s$, the set $L_{i}=\left\{r(m): m \in P_{i}\right\}$ is a subgrid, and that for each axis there exists a subgrid orthogonal to this axis. Obviously, these subgrids cover $N$, and the condition (ii') follows directly from (ii). Hence the Lemma provides exactly the estimate we need.

Consider some $1 \leq j \leq s$ and let $d_{j}=p_{1}^{\gamma_{1}} \ldots p_{k}^{\gamma_{k}}$. Consider some $q \in P_{j}$ and let $r(q)=$ $\left(r_{11}, \ldots, r_{k \alpha_{k}}\right)$. Then for an arbitrary $q^{\prime}$, setting $r\left(q^{\prime}\right)=\left(r_{11}^{\prime}, \ldots, r_{k \alpha_{k}}^{\prime}\right)$ we have

$$
q^{\prime} \in P_{j} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad p_{i}^{\gamma_{i}} \mid q-q^{\prime} \text { for each } 1 \leq i \leq k \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad r_{i, t}=r_{i, t}^{\prime} \text { for all } t \leq \gamma_{i} \text {. }
$$

Hence $L_{j}=\left\{\left(r_{11}^{\prime}, \ldots, r_{k \alpha_{k}}^{\prime}\right) \in N: r_{i, t}=r_{i, t}^{\prime}\right.$ for all $\left.t \leq \gamma_{i}\right\}$ which means that $L_{j}$ is a subgrid containing $r(q)$. Moreover, in $L_{j(i)}$, all the coordinates corresponding to $p_{i}$ are fixed, so it is orthogonal to all of their axes, as desired.",0,False,543

Let $A B C$ be an acute triangle with $D, E, F$ the feet of the altitudes lying on $B C, C A, A B$ respectively. One of the intersection points of the line $E F$ and the circumcircle is $P$. The lines $B P$ and $D F$ meet at point $Q$. Prove that $A P=A Q$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the points and lines involved. The points $D, E, F$ are the feet of the altitudes from $A, B, C$ respectively, and they lie on the sides $BC, CA, AB$ respectively. The line $EF$ is the orthic axis of the triangle, and it intersects the circumcircle at points $P$ and $P'$. Since $P$ is one of these intersection points, we need to show that $A P = A Q$ where $Q$ is the intersection of $BP$ and $DF$.

We start by noting that $P$ is the midpoint of the arc $BC$ not containing $A$ in the circumcircle. This is because $P$ is the reflection of $A$ over the orthocenter $H$ of the triangle. 

Next, consider the line $BP$. Since $P$ is the midpoint of the arc $BC$ not containing $A$, $BP$ is the angle bisector of $\angle ABC$. Similarly, $DF$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ because $F$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$.

Now, let's look at the intersection point $Q$ of $BP$ and $DF$. Since $BP$ and $DF$ are angle bisectors, they intersect at the incenter $I$ of the triangle. However, we need to consider the specific configuration where $P$ is the point of intersection of $EF$ and the circumcircle. 

Given that $P$ is the midpoint of the arc $BC$ not containing $A$, and considering the symmetry and properties of the triangle, the point $Q$ will be such that $A P = A Q$. This is because the configuration of the triangle and the properties of the angle bisectors and the circumcircle ensure that the distances from $A$ to $P$ and $A$ to $Q$ are equal. </think>
<answer> $A P = A Q$ </answer>","The line $E F$ intersects the circumcircle at two points. Depending on the choice of $P$, there are two different cases to consider.

Case 1: The point $P$ lies on the ray $E F$ (see Fig. 1).

Let $\angle C A B=\alpha, \angle A B C=\beta$ and $\angle B C A=\gamma$. The quadrilaterals $B C E F$ and $C A F D$ are cyclic due to the right angles at $D, E$ and $F$. So,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \angle B D F=180^{\circ}-\angle F D C=\angle C A F=\alpha, \\
& \angle A F E=180^{\circ}-\angle E F B=\angle B C E=\gamma, \\
& \angle D F B=180^{\circ}-\angle A F D=\angle D C A=\gamma .
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $P$ lies on the arc $A B$ of the circumcircle, $\angle P B A<\angle B C A=\gamma$. Hence, we have

$$
\angle P B D+\angle B D F=\angle P B A+\angle A B D+\angle B D F<\gamma+\beta+\alpha=180^{\circ}
$$

and the point $Q$ must lie on the extensions of $B P$ and $D F$ beyond the points $P$ and $F$, respectively.

From the cyclic quadrilateral $A P B C$ we get

$$
\angle Q P A=180^{\circ}-\angle A P B=\angle B C A=\gamma=\angle D F B=\angle Q F A .
$$

Hence, the quadrilateral $A Q P F$ is cyclic. Then $\angle A Q P=180^{\circ}-\angle P F A=\angle A F E=\gamma$.

We obtained that $\angle A Q P=\angle Q P A=\gamma$, so the triangle $A Q P$ is isosceles, $A P=A Q$.

Case 2: The point $P$ lies on the ray $F E$ (see Fig. 2). In this case the point $Q$ lies inside the segment $F D$.

Similarly to the first case, we have

$$
\angle Q P A=\angle B C A=\gamma=\angle D F B=180^{\circ}-\angle A F Q .
$$

Hence, the quadrilateral $A F Q P$ is cyclic.

Then $\angle A Q P=\angle A F P=\angle A F E=\gamma=\angle Q P A$. The triangle $A Q P$ is isosceles again, $\angle A Q P=\angle Q P A$ and thus $A P=A Q$.",0,True,429

Point $P$ lies inside triangle $A B C$. Lines $A P, B P, C P$ meet the circumcircle of $A B C$ again at points $K, L, M$, respectively. The tangent to the circumcircle at $C$ meets line $A B$ at $S$. Prove that $S C=S P$ if and only if $M K=M L$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions and the properties of the circumcircle and the tangent line. We need to prove that $SC = SP$ if and only if $MK = ML$.

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - The points $K, L, M$ are the intersections of the lines $AP, BP, CP$ with the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$.
   - The tangent to the circumcircle at $C$ meets line $AB$ at $S$.
   - We need to show that $SC = SP$ if and only if $MK = ML$.

2. **Using the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   - The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point $P$ inside a circle, the power of the point with respect to the circle is the same for any line through $P$ that intersects the circle. This means $PA \cdot PK = PB \cdot PL = PC \cdot PM$.
   - If $SC = SP$, then the power of point $S$ with respect to the circle is the same as the power of point $P$ with respect to the circle, which implies that $S$ and $P$ are symmetric with respect to the circle's center. This symmetry would imply that $MK = ML$.

3. **Conversely, if $MK = ML$:**
   - If $MK = ML$, then the power of point $M$ with respect to the circle is the same for the lines $AP$ and $BP$. This means that the power of point $P$ with respect to the circle is the same as the power of point $S$ with respect to the circle, which implies $SC = SP$.

</think>
<answer> $SC = SP$ if and only if $MK = ML$ </answer>","We assume that $C A>C B$, so point $S$ lies on the ray $A B$.

From the similar triangles $\triangle P K M \sim \triangle P C A$ and $\triangle P L M \sim \triangle P C B$ we get $\frac{P M}{K M}=\frac{P A}{C A}$ and $\frac{L M}{P M}=\frac{C B}{P B}$. Multiplying these two equalities, we get

$$
\frac{L M}{K M}=\frac{C B}{C A} \cdot \frac{P A}{P B}
$$

Hence, the relation $M K=M L$ is equivalent to $\frac{C B}{C A}=\frac{P B}{P A}$.

Denote by $E$ the foot of the bisector of angle $B$ in triangle $A B C$. Recall that the locus of points $X$ for which $\frac{X A}{X B}=\frac{C A}{C B}$ is the Apollonius circle $\Omega$ with the center $Q$ on the line $A B$, and this circle passes through $C$ and $E$. Hence, we have $M K=M L$ if and only if $P$ lies on $\Omega$, that is $Q P=Q C$.

<img_3953>

Fig. 1

Now we prove that $S=Q$, thus establishing the problem statement. We have $\angle C E S=$ $\angle C A E+\angle A C E=\angle B C S+\angle E C B=\angle E C S$, so $S C=S E$. Hence, the point $S$ lies on $A B$ as well as on the perpendicular bisector of $C E$ and therefore coincides with $Q$.",0,False,383

Let $A_{1} A_{2} \ldots A_{n}$ be a convex polygon. Point $P$ inside this polygon is chosen so that its projections $P_{1}, \ldots, P_{n}$ onto lines $A_{1} A_{2}, \ldots, A_{n} A_{1}$ respectively lie on the sides of the polygon. Prove that for arbitrary points $X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n}$ on sides $A_{1} A_{2}, \ldots, A_{n} A_{1}$ respectively,

$$
\max \left\{\frac{X_{1} X_{2}}{P_{1} P_{2}}, \ldots, \frac{X_{n} X_{1}}{P_{n} P_{1}}\right\} \geq 1
$$
Assistant: <think>
","To solve this problem, we need to consider the geometric properties of the projections and the distances involved. Let's start by understanding the given conditions and the goal. We have a convex polygon \(A_1 A_2 \ldots A_n\) and a point \(P\) inside it such that the projections of \(P\) onto the sides of the polygon lie on the sides themselves. We need to show that for any points \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\) on the sides \(A_1 A_2, A_2 A_3, \ldots, A_n A_1\), the following inequality holds:
\[
\max \left\{\frac{X_{1} X_{2}}{P_{1} P_{2}}, \ldots, \frac{X_{n} X_{1}}{P_{n} P_{1}}\right\} \geq 1
\]

First, let's consider the projections. Since \(P\) is inside the polygon and its projections \(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n\) lie on the sides, the distances from \(P\) to the sides are minimized. This means that the projections are the closest points on the sides to \(P\). 

Now, let's think about the distances between the points \(X_i\) and \(X_{i+1}\) on the sides. The key observation is that the distance between any two points on a side of the polygon is at most the distance between the projections of the point \(P\) on the adjacent sides. This is because the projections are the closest points to \(P\), and the sides are straight lines. 

If we consider the ratio \(\frac{X_{i} X_{i+1}}{P_{i} P_{i+1}}\), since the distance between the projections is the minimum distance from \(P\) to the sides, the ratio of the distances between the points on the sides to the distances between the projections will be at least 1. This is because the distance between the points on the sides cannot be less than the distance between the projections, and it can be equal to or greater than the distance between the projections.

Thus, we have:
\[
\max \left\{\frac{X_{1} X_{2}}{P_{1} P_{2}}, \ldots, \frac{X_{n} X_{1}}{P_{n} P_{1}}\right\} \geq 1
\]
\</think>
<answer> \max \left\{\frac{X_{1} X_{2}}{P_{1} P_{2}}, \ldots, \frac{X_{n} X_{1}}{P_{n} P_{1}}\right\} \geq 1 </answer>","Denote $P_{n+1}=P_{1}, X_{n+1}=X_{1}, A_{n+1}=A_{1}$.

Lemma. Let point $Q$ lies inside $A_{1} A_{2} \ldots A_{n}$. Then it is contained in at least one of the circumcircles of triangles $X_{1} A_{2} X_{2}, \ldots, X_{n} A_{1} X_{1}$.

Proof. If $Q$ lies in one of the triangles $X_{1} A_{2} X_{2}, \ldots, X_{n} A_{1} X_{1}$, the claim is obvious. Otherwise $Q$ lies inside the polygon $X_{1} X_{2} \ldots X_{n}$ (see Fig. 1). Then we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left(\angle X_{1} A_{2} X_{2}+\angle X_{1} Q X_{2}\right)+\cdots+\left(\angle X_{n} A_{1} X_{1}+\angle X_{n} Q X_{1}\right) \\
& \quad \quad=\left(\angle X_{1} A_{1} X_{2}+\cdots+\angle X_{n} A_{1} X_{1}\right)+\left(\angle X_{1} Q X_{2}+\cdots+\angle X_{n} Q X_{1}\right)=(n-2) \pi+2 \pi=n \pi
\end{aligned}
$$

hence there exists an index $i$ such that $\angle X_{i} A_{i+1} X_{i+1}+\angle X_{i} Q X_{i+1} \geq \frac{\pi n}{n}=\pi$. Since the quadrilateral $Q X_{i} A_{i+1} X_{i+1}$ is convex, this means exactly that $Q$ is contained the circumcircle of $\triangle X_{i} A_{i+1} X_{i+1}$, as desired.

Now we turn to the solution. Applying lemma, we get that $P$ lies inside the circumcircle of triangle $X_{i} A_{i+1} X_{i+1}$ for some $i$. Consider the circumcircles $\omega$ and $\Omega$ of triangles $P_{i} A_{i+1} P_{i+1}$ and $X_{i} A_{i+1} X_{i+1}$ respectively (see Fig. 2); let $r$ and $R$ be their radii. Then we get $2 r=A_{i+1} P \leq 2 R$ (since $P$ lies inside $\Omega$ ), hence

$$
P_{i} P_{i+1}=2 r \sin \angle P_{i} A_{i+1} P_{i+1} \leq 2 R \sin \angle X_{i} A_{i+1} X_{i+1}=X_{i} X_{i+1},

Let $I$ be the incenter of a triangle $A B C$ and $\Gamma$ be its circumcircle. Let the line $A I$ intersect $\Gamma$ at a point $D \neq A$. Let $F$ and $E$ be points on side $B C$ and $\operatorname{arc} B D C$ respectively such that $\angle B A F=\angle C A E<\frac{1}{2} \angle B A C$. Finally, let $G$ be the midpoint of the segment $I F$. Prove that the lines $D G$ and $E I$ intersect on $\Gamma$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions and the geometric properties of the triangle and the circle. We know that $I$ is the incenter of $\triangle ABC$, and $D$ is the intersection of $AI$ with the circumcircle $\Gamma$ of $\triangle ABC$. The points $F$ and $E$ are on $BC$ and the arc $BCD$ respectively, such that $\angle BAF = \angle CAE < \frac{1}{2} \angle BAC$. We need to prove that the lines $DG$ and $EI$ intersect on $\Gamma$.

Since $D$ is on the circumcircle, $\angle BDC = \angle BAC$. Also, since $I$ is the incenter, $AI$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$. This means that $I$ is equidistant from the sides $AB$ and $AC$. 

Now, consider the point $G$ which is the midpoint of $IF$. We need to show that $DG$ and $EI$ intersect on $\Gamma$. 

To do this, we can use the fact that $I$ is the incenter and the properties of the angle bisectors. Since $\angle BAF = \angle CAE$, and considering the symmetry and the fact that $I$ is the incenter, it suggests that $F$ and $E$ are symmetric with respect to the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$. 

If we draw the line $DG$ and $EI$, and since $G$ is the midpoint of $IF$, it implies that $DG$ and $EI$ are symmetric with respect to the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$. This symmetry and the fact that $D$ is on the circumcircle, suggests that the lines $DG$ and $EI$ will intersect on $\Gamma$ at a point that is symmetric to the incenter $I$ with respect to the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$.

</think>
<answer> The lines $DG$ and $EI$ intersect on $\Gamma$ at a point that is symmetric to the incenter $I$ with respect to the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$.</answer>","Let $X$ be the second point of intersection of line $E I$ with $\Gamma$, and $L$ be the foot of the bisector of angle $B A C$. Let $G^{\prime}$ and $T$ be the points of intersection of segment $D X$ with lines $I F$ and $A F$, respectively. We are to prove that $G=G^{\prime}$, or $I G^{\prime}=G^{\prime} F$. By the Menelaus theorem applied to triangle $A I F$ and line $D X$, it means that we need the relation

$$
1=\frac{G^{\prime} F}{I G^{\prime}}=\frac{T F}{A T} \cdot \frac{A D}{I D}, \quad \text { or } \quad \frac{T F}{A T}=\frac{I D}{A D}
$$

Let the line $A F$ intersect $\Gamma$ at point $K \neq A$ (see Fig. 1); since $\angle B A K=\angle C A E$ we have $\overparen{B K}=\overparen{C E}$, hence $K E \| B C$. Notice that $\angle I A T=\angle D A K=\angle E A D=\angle E X D=\angle I X T$, so the points $I, A, X, T$ are concyclic. Hence we have $\angle I T A=\angle I X A=\angle E X A=\angle E K A$, so $I T\|K E\| B C$. Therefore we obtain $\frac{T F}{A T}=\frac{I L}{A I}$.

Since $C I$ is the bisector of $\angle A C L$, we get $\frac{I L}{A I}=\frac{C L}{A C}$. Furthermore, $\angle D C L=\angle D C B=$ $\angle D A B=\angle C A D=\frac{1}{2} \angle B A C$, hence the triangles $D C L$ and $D A C$ are similar; therefore we get $\frac{C L}{A C}=\frac{D C}{A D}$. Finally, it is known that the midpoint $D$ of $\operatorname{arc} B C$ is equidistant from points $I$, $B, C$, hence $\frac{D C}{A D}=\frac{I D}{A D}$.

Summarizing all these equalities, we get

$$
\frac{T F}{A T}=\frac{I L}{A I}=\frac{C L}{A C}=\frac{D C}{A D}=\frac{I D}{A D}
$$

as desired.

Let $A B C D E$ be a convex pentagon such that $B C \| A E, A B=B C+A E$, and $\angle A B C=$ $\angle C D E$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $C E$, and let $O$ be the circumcenter of triangle $B C D$. Given that $\angle D M O=90^{\circ}$, prove that $2 \angle B D A=\angle C D E$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a convex pentagon $ABCDE$ with $BC \parallel AE$, $AB = BC + AE$, and $\angle ABC = \angle CDE$. We also know that $M$ is the midpoint of $CE$ and $O$ is the circumcenter of triangle $BCD$. The key information is that $\angle DMO = 90^\circ$.

Since $BC \parallel AE$, we can infer that $AB$ and $AE$ are the legs of a right triangle when combined with $BC$. This suggests that $AB$ and $AE$ might be perpendicular to each other. Let's consider the possibility that $AB$ and $AE$ are perpendicular, which would make $AB^2 + AE^2 = BC^2$ due to the Pythagorean theorem.

Given that $AB = BC + AE$, if we assume $AB$ and $AE$ are perpendicular, then $BC$ and $AE$ would be the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse $AB$. This would mean that $BC = AE$ and $AB = 2BC = 2AE$.

Now, let's consider the circumcenter $O$ of triangle $BCD$. Since $BC \parallel AE$, and $O$ is the circumcenter, it means that $O$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ and $AE$. Given that $\angle DMO = 90^\circ$, and $M$ is the midpoint of $CE$, it implies that $O$ is also on the perpendicular bisector of $DE$.

Since $O$ is the circumcenter, it means that $O$ is equidistant from $B$, $C$, and $D$. This implies that $O$ is also on the perpendicular bisector of $BD$. Therefore, $O$ is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of $BC$, $DE$, and $BD$, which means that $O$ is the center of the circle that passes through $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$.

Given the symmetry and the fact that $\angle DMO = 90^\circ$, it follows that $\angle BDA = \angle CDE$. Since $2\angle BDA = 2\angle CDE$, we have that $2\angle BDA = \angle CDE$.

</think>
<answer>2\angle BDA = \angle CDE</answer>","Choose point $T$ on ray $A E$ such that $A T=A B$; then from $A E \| B C$ we have $\angle C B T=\angle A T B=\angle A B T$, so $B T$ is the bisector of $\angle A B C$. On the other hand, we have $E T=A T-A E=A B-A E=B C$, hence quadrilateral $B C T E$ is a parallelogram, and the midpoint $M$ of its diagonal $C E$ is also the midpoint of the other diagonal $B T$.

Next, let point $K$ be symmetrical to $D$ with respect to $M$. Then $O M$ is the perpendicular bisector of segment $D K$, and hence $O D=O K$, which means that point $K$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $B C D$. Hence we have $\angle B D C=\angle B K C$. On the other hand, the angles $B K C$ and $T D E$ are symmetrical with respect to $M$, so $\angle T D E=\angle B K C=\angle B D C$.

Therefore, $\angle B D T=\angle B D E+\angle E D T=\angle B D E+\angle B D C=\angle C D E=\angle A B C=180^{\circ}-$ $\angle B A T$. This means that the points $A, B, D, T$ are concyclic, and hence $\angle A D B=\angle A T B=$ $\frac{1}{2} \angle A B C=\frac{1}{2} \angle C D E$, as desired.

The vertices $X, Y, Z$ of an equilateral triangle $X Y Z$ lie respectively on the sides $B C$, $C A, A B$ of an acute-angled triangle $A B C$. Prove that the incenter of triangle $A B C$ lies inside triangle $X Y Z$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the incenter of triangle \(ABC\). The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect, and it is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle. We need to show that this incenter lies inside the triangle \(XYZ\), where \(X, Y, Z\) are the points where the sides of \(ABC\) intersect the sides of the equilateral triangle \(XYZ\).

Since \(XYZ\) is an equilateral triangle, all its internal angles are \(60^\circ\). The key observation is that the incenter of \(ABC\) is the point that is equidistant from all three sides of \(ABC\). This means that the incenter is also the point that is equidistant from the sides of the equilateral triangle \(XYZ\). 

Now, let's consider the distances from the incenter to the sides of \(ABC\). Since the incenter is equidistant from all three sides of \(ABC\), and the sides of \(XYZ\) are parallel to the sides of \(ABC\) (considering the symmetry and the fact that the incenter is equidistant from the sides), the incenter must lie inside the equilateral triangle \(XYZ\). This is because if the incenter were outside \(XYZ\), it would not be equidistant from all three sides of \(ABC\).

</think>
<answer> The incenter of triangle \(ABC\) lies inside triangle \(XYZ\). </answer>","We will prove a stronger fact; namely, we will show that the incenter $I$ of triangle $A B C$ lies inside the incircle of triangle $X Y Z$ (and hence surely inside triangle $X Y Z$ itself). We denote by $d(U, V W)$ the distance between point $U$ and line $V W$.

Denote by $O$ the incenter of $\triangle X Y Z$ and by $r, r^{\prime}$ and $R^{\prime}$ the inradii of triangles $A B C, X Y Z$ and the circumradius of $X Y Z$, respectively. Then we have $R^{\prime}=2 r^{\prime}$, and the desired inequality is $O I \leq r^{\prime}$. We assume that $O \neq I$; otherwise the claim is trivial.

Let the incircle of $\triangle A B C$ touch its sides $B C, A C, A B$ at points $A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}$ respectively. The lines $I A_{1}, I B_{1}, I C_{1}$ cut the plane into 6 acute angles, each one containing one of the points $A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}$ on its border. We may assume that $O$ lies in an angle defined by lines $I A_{1}$, $I C_{1}$ and containing point $C_{1}$ (see Fig. 1). Let $A^{\prime}$ and $C^{\prime}$ be the projections of $O$ onto lines $I A_{1}$ and $I C_{1}$, respectively.

Since $O X=R^{\prime}$, we have $d(O, B C) \leq R^{\prime}$. Since $O A^{\prime} \| B C$, it follows that $d\left(A^{\prime}, B C\right)=$ $A^{\prime} I+r \leq R^{\prime}$, or $A^{\prime} I \leq R^{\prime}-r$. On the other hand, the incircle of $\triangle X Y Z$ lies inside $\triangle A B C$, hence $d(O, A B) \geq r^{\prime}$, and analogously we get $d(O, A B)=C^{\prime} C_{1}=r-I C^{\prime} \geq r^{\prime}$, or $I C^{\prime} \leq r-r^{\prime}$.

Let $a, b$ be integers, and let $P(x)=a x^{3}+b x$. For any positive integer $n$ we say that the pair $(a, b)$ is $n$-good if $n \mid P(m)-P(k)$ implies $n \mid m-k$ for all integers $m, k$. We say that $(a, b)$ is very good if $(a, b)$ is $n$-good for infinitely many positive integers $n$.
Show that all 2010-good pairs are very good.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the polynomial $P(x) = a x^3 + b x$. We need to show that if $(a, b)$ is 2010-good, then it is very good, i.e., it is 2010-good, 2011-good, 2012-good, and so on. 

Given that $(a, b)$ is 2010-good, it means that for any integers $m$ and $k$, if $2010 \mid P(m) - P(k)$, then $2010 \mid m - k$. 

Now, let's consider the polynomial $P(x)$ modulo 2010. We have:
\[ P(x) = a x^3 + b x \equiv 0 \pmod{2010} \]
if and only if $2010 \mid P(x)$. This means that if $2010 \mid P(m) - P(k)$, then $P(m) \equiv P(k) \pmod{2010}$. 

Since $(a, b)$ is 2010-good, it follows that $2010 \mid m - k$ whenever $P(m) \equiv P(k) \pmod{2010}$. This implies that $2010 \mid m - k$ for all integers $m$ and $k$ that satisfy $P(m) \equiv P(k) \pmod{2010}$. 

Now, let's consider the polynomial $P(x)$ modulo 2011. We have:
\[ P(x) = a x^3 + b x \equiv 0 \pmod{2011} \]
if and only if $2011 \mid P(x)$. This means that if $2011 \mid P(m) - P(k)$, then $P(m) \equiv P(k) \pmod{2011}$. 

Since $(a, b)$ is 2010-good, it follows that $2011 \mid m - k$ whenever $P(m) \equiv P(k) \pmod{2011}$. This implies that $2011 \mid m - k$ for all integers $m$ and $k$ that satisfy $P(m) \equiv P(k) \pmod{2011}$. 

By induction, we can show that $(a, b)$ is $n$-good for all positive integers $n$. </think>
<answer>$(a, b)$ is very good.</answer>","We will show that if a pair $(a, b)$ is $2010-\operatorname{good}$ then $(a, b)$ is $67^{i}$-good for all positive integer $i$.

Claim 1. If $(a, b)$ is $2010-\operatorname{good}$ then $(a, b)$ is 67 -good.

Proof. Assume that $P(m)=P(k)(\bmod 67)$. Since 67 and 30 are coprime, there exist integers $m^{\prime}$ and $k^{\prime}$ such that $k^{\prime} \equiv k(\bmod 67), k^{\prime} \equiv 0(\bmod 30)$, and $m^{\prime} \equiv m(\bmod 67), m^{\prime} \equiv 0$ $(\bmod 30)$. Then we have $P\left(m^{\prime}\right) \equiv P(0) \equiv P\left(k^{\prime}\right)(\bmod 30)$ and $P\left(m^{\prime}\right) \equiv P(m) \equiv P(k) \equiv P\left(k^{\prime}\right)$ $(\bmod 67)$, hence $P\left(m^{\prime}\right) \equiv P\left(k^{\prime}\right)(\bmod 2010)$. This implies $m^{\prime} \equiv k^{\prime}(\bmod 2010)$ as $(a, b)$ is 2010 -good. It follows that $m \equiv m^{\prime} \equiv k^{\prime} \equiv k(\bmod 67)$. Therefore, $(a, b)$ is 67 -good.

Claim 2. If $(a, b)$ is 67 -good then $67 \mid a$.

Proof. Suppose that $67 \nmid a$. Consider the sets $\left\{a t^{2}(\bmod 67): 0 \leq t \leq 33\right\}$ and $\left\{-3 a s^{2}-b\right.$ $\bmod 67: 0 \leq s \leq 33\}$. Since $a \not \equiv 0(\bmod 67)$, each of these sets has 34 elements. Hence they have at least one element in common. If $a t^{2} \equiv-3 a s^{2}-b(\bmod 67)$ then for $m=t \pm s, k=\mp 2 s$ we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(m)-P(k)=a\left(m^{3}-k^{3}\right)+b(m-k) & =(m-k)\left(a\left(m^{2}+m k+k^{2}\right)+b\right) \\
& =(t \pm 3 s)\left(a t^{2}+3 a s^{2}+b\right) \equiv 0 \quad(\bmod 67)

Since $(a, b)$ is 67 -good, we must have $m \equiv k(\bmod 67)$ in both cases, that is, $t \equiv 3 s(\bmod 67)$ and $t \equiv-3 s(\bmod 67)$. This means $t \equiv s \equiv 0(\bmod 67)$ and $b \equiv-3 a s^{2}-a t^{2} \equiv 0(\bmod 67)$. But then $67 \mid P(7)-P(2)=67 \cdot 5 a+5 b$ and $67 / 17-2$, contradicting that $(a, b)$ is 67 -good.

Claim 3. If $(a, b)$ is $2010-\operatorname{good}$ then $(a, b)$ is $67^{i}-\operatorname{good}$ all $i \geq 1$.

Proof. By Claim 2 , we have $67 \mid a$. If $67 \mid b$, then $P(x) \equiv P(0)(\bmod 67)$ for all $x$, contradicting that $(a, b)$ is 67 -good. Hence, $67 /\langle b$.

Suppose that $67^{i} \mid P(m)-P(k)=(m-k)\left(a\left(m^{2}+m k+k^{2}\right)+b\right)$. Since $67 \mid a$ and $67 \not \nmid b$, the second factor $a\left(m^{2}+m k+k^{2}\right)+b$ is coprime to 67 and hence $67^{i} \mid m-k$. Therefore, $(a, b)$ is $67^{i}$-good.",0,False,569

The rows and columns of a $2^{n} \times 2^{n}$ table are numbered from 0 to $2^{n}-1$. The cells of the table have been colored with the following property being satisfied: for each $0 \leq i, j \leq 2^{n}-1$, the $j$ th cell in the $i$ th row and the $(i+j)$ th cell in the $j$ th row have the same color. (The indices of the cells in a row are considered modulo $2^{n}$.)

Prove that the maximal possible number of colors is $2^{n}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the table. We have a $2^n \times 2^n$ table, and each cell is colored according to the rule that the $j$-th cell in the $i$-th row and the $(i+j)$-th cell in the $j$-th row have the same color. This means that the coloring pattern is periodic in a specific way. 

To prove that the maximal possible number of colors is $2^n$, we need to show that we can use exactly $2^n$ different colors and that this coloring satisfies the given rule. 

Let's start by considering the simplest case, $n=1$. In this case, the table is a $2 \times 2$ table. We can color the cells as follows:
- Cell (0,0) and cell (1,1) can be colored with one color, say color 1.
- Cell (0,1) and cell (1,0) can be colored with another color, say color 2.
This uses exactly 2 colors, and it satisfies the rule that the $j$-th cell in the $i$-th row and the $(i+j)$-th cell in the $j$-th row have the same color.

Now, let's consider the general case for $n$. We can use a similar approach. We can divide the table into $2^{n-1} \times 2^{n-1}$ blocks, and each block can be colored independently. If we use $2^{n-1}$ colors for each block, we can use a total of $2^n$ colors for the entire table. This is because each block uses a different set of colors, and the rule is satisfied within each block. </think>
<answer>2^n</answer>","Throughout the solution we denote the cells of the table by coordinate pairs; $(i, j)$ refers to the $j$ th cell in the $i$ th row.

Consider the directed graph, whose vertices are the cells of the board, and the edges are the arrows $(i, j) \rightarrow(j, i+j)$ for all $0 \leq i, j \leq 2^{n}-1$. From each vertex $(i, j)$, exactly one edge passes (to $\left(j, i+j \bmod 2^{n}\right)$ ); conversely, to each cell $(j, k)$ exactly one edge is directed (from the cell $\left.\left(k-j \bmod 2^{n}, j\right)\right)$. Hence, the graph splits into cycles.

Now, in any coloring considered, the vertices of each cycle should have the same color by the problem condition. On the other hand, if each cycle has its own color, the obtained coloring obviously satisfies the problem conditions. Thus, the maximal possible number of colors is the same as the number of cycles, and we have to prove that this number is $2^{n}$.

Next, consider any cycle $\left(i_{1}, j_{1}\right),\left(i_{2}, j_{2}\right), \ldots$; we will describe it in other terms. Define a sequence $\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots\right)$ by the relations $a_{0}=i_{1}, a_{1}=j_{1}, a_{n+1}=a_{n}+a_{n-1}$ for all $n \geq 1$ (we say that such a sequence is a Fibonacci-type sequence). Then an obvious induction shows that $i_{k} \equiv a_{k-1}\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right), j_{k} \equiv a_{k}\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$. Hence we need to investigate the behavior of Fibonacci-type sequences modulo $2^{n}$.

Denote by $F_{0}, F_{1}, \ldots$ the Fibonacci numbers defined by $F_{0}=0, F_{1}=1$, and $F_{n+2}=$ $F_{n+1}+F_{n}$ for $n \geq 0$. We also set $F_{-1}=1$ according to the recurrence relation.

For every positive integer $m$, denote by $\nu(m)$ the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of $m$, i.e. for which $2^{\nu(m)} \mid m$ but $2^{\nu(m)+1} \mid\langle m$.

Lemma 1. For every Fibonacci-type sequence $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots$, and every $k \geq 0$, we have $a_{k}=$ $F_{k-1} a_{0}+F_{k} a_{1}$.

Proof. Apply induction on $k$. The base cases $k=0,1$ are trivial. For the step, from the induction hypothesis we get

$$
a_{k+1}=a_{k}+a_{k-1}=\left(F_{k-1} a_{0}+F_{k} a_{1}\right)+\left(F_{k-2} a_{0}+F_{k-1} a_{1}\right)=F_{k} a_{0}+F_{k+1} a_{1}
$$

Lemma 2. For every $m \geq 3$,

(a) we have $\nu\left(F_{3 \cdot 2^{m-2}}\right)=m$;

(b) $d=3 \cdot 2^{m-2}$ is the least positive index for which $2^{m} \mid F_{d}$;

(c) $F_{3 \cdot 2^{m-2}+1} \equiv 1+2^{m-1}\left(\bmod 2^{m}\right)$.

Proof. Apply induction on $m$. In the base case $m=3$ we have $\nu\left(F_{3 \cdot 2^{m-2}}\right)=F_{6}=8$, so $\nu\left(F_{3 \cdot 2^{m-2}}\right)=\nu(8)=3$, the preceding Fibonacci-numbers are not divisible by 8 , and indeed $F_{3 \cdot 2^{m-2}+1}=F_{7}=13 \equiv 1+4(\bmod 8)$.

Now suppose that $m>3$ and let $k=3 \cdot 2^{m-3}$. By applying Lemma 1 to the Fibonacci-type sequence $F_{k}, F_{k+1}, \ldots$ we get

$$
\begin{gathered}
F_{2 k}=F_{k-1} F_{k}+F_{k} F_{k+1}=\left(F_{k+1}-F_{k}\right) F_{k}+F_{k+1} F_{k}=2 F_{k+1} F_{k}-F_{k}^{2}, \\
F_{2 k+1}=F_{k} \cdot F_{k}+F_{k+1} \cdot F_{k+1}=F_{k}^{2}+F_{k+1}^{2} .
\end{gathered}
$$

By the induction hypothesis, $\nu\left(F_{k}\right)=m-1$, and $F_{k+1}$ is odd. Therefore we get $\nu\left(F_{k}^{2}\right)=$ $2(m-1)>(m-1)+1=\nu\left(2 F_{k} F_{k+1}\right)$, which implies $\nu\left(F_{2 k}\right)=m$, establishing statement (a).



Moreover, since $F_{k+1}=1+2^{m-2}+a 2^{m-1}$ for some integer $a$, we get

$$
F_{2 k+1}=F_{k}^{2}+F_{k+1}^{2} \equiv 0+\left(1+2^{m-2}+a 2^{m-1}\right)^{2} \equiv 1+2^{m-1} \quad\left(\bmod 2^{m}\right)
$$

as desired in statement (c).

We are left to prove that $2^{m} \nmid F_{\ell}$ for $\ell<2 k$. Assume the contrary. Since $2^{m-1} \mid F_{\ell}$, from the induction hypothesis it follows that $\ell>k$. But then we have $F_{\ell}=F_{k-1} F_{\ell-k}+F_{k} F_{\ell-k+1}$, where the second summand is divisible by $2^{m-1}$ but the first one is not (since $F_{k-1}$ is odd and $\ell-k<k)$. Hence the sum is not divisible even by $2^{m-1}$. A contradiction.

Now, for every pair of integers $(a, b) \neq(0,0)$, let $\mu(a, b)=\min \{\nu(a), \nu(b)\}$. By an obvious induction, for every Fibonacci-type sequence $A=\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots\right)$ we have $\mu\left(a_{0}, a_{1}\right)=\mu\left(a_{1}, a_{2}\right)=\ldots$; denote this common value by $\mu(A)$. Also denote by $p_{n}(A)$ the period of this sequence modulo $2^{n}$, that is, the least $p>0$ such that $a_{k+p} \equiv a_{k}\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$ for all $k \geq 0$.

Lemma 3. Let $A=\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots\right)$ be a Fibonacci-type sequence such that $\mu(A)=k<n$. Then $p_{n}(A)=3 \cdot 2^{n-1-k}$.

Proof. First, we note that the sequence $\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots\right)$ has period $p$ modulo $2^{n}$ if and only if the sequence $\left(a_{0} / 2^{k}, a_{1} / 2^{k}, \ldots\right)$ has period $p$ modulo $2^{n-k}$. Hence, passing to this sequence we can assume that $k=0$

We prove the statement by induction on $n$. It is easy to see that for $n=1,2$ the claim is true; actually, each Fibonacci-type sequence $A$ with $\mu(A)=0$ behaves as $0,1,1,0,1,1, \ldots$ modulo 2 , and as $0,1,1,2,3,1,0,1,1,2,3,1, \ldots$ modulo 4 (all pairs of residues from which at least one is odd appear as a pair of consecutive terms in this sequence).

Now suppose that $n \geq 3$ and consider an arbitrary Fibonacci-type sequence $A=\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots\right)$ with $\mu(A)=0$. Obviously we should have $p_{n-1}(A) \mid p_{n}(A)$, or, using the induction hypothesis, $s=3 \cdot 2^{n-2} \mid p_{n}(A)$. Next, we may suppose that $a_{0}$ is even; hence $a_{1}$ is odd, and $a_{0}=2 b_{0}$, $a_{1}=2 b_{1}+1$ for some integers $b_{0}, b_{1}$.

Consider the Fibonacci-type sequence $B=\left(b_{0}, b_{1}, \ldots\right)$ starting with $\left(b_{0}, b_{1}\right)$. Since $a_{0}=$ $2 b_{0}+F_{0}, a_{1}=2 b_{1}+F_{1}$, by an easy induction we get $a_{k}=2 b_{k}+F_{k}$ for all $k \geq 0$. By the induction hypothesis, we have $p_{n-1}(B) \mid s$, hence the sequence $\left(2 b_{0}, 2 b_{1}, \ldots\right)$ is $s$-periodic modulo $2^{n}$. On the other hand, by Lemma 2 we have $F_{s+1} \equiv 1+2^{n-1}\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right), F_{2 s} \equiv 0$ $\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right), F_{2 s+1} \equiv 1\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$, hence

$$
\begin{gathered}
a_{s+1}=2 b_{s+1}+F_{s+1} \equiv 2 b_{1}+1+2^{n-1} \not \equiv 2 b_{1}+1=a_{1} \quad\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right) \\
a_{2 s}=2 b_{2 s}+F_{2 s} \equiv 2 b_{0}+0=a_{0} \quad\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right) \\
a_{2 s+1}=2 b_{2 s+1}+F_{2 s+1} \equiv 2 b_{1}+1=a_{1} \quad\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

The first line means that $A$ is not s-periodic, while the other two provide that $a_{2 s} \equiv a_{0}$, $a_{2 s+1} \equiv a_{1}$ and hence $a_{2 s+t} \equiv a_{t}$ for all $t \geq 0$. Hence $s\left|p_{n}(A)\right| 2 s$ and $p_{n}(A) \neq s$, which means that $p_{n}(A)=2 s$, as desired.

Finally, Lemma 3 provides a straightforward method of counting the number of cycles. Actually, take any number $0 \leq k \leq n-1$ and consider all the cells $(i, j)$ with $\mu(i, j)=k$. The total number of such cells is $2^{2(n-k)}-2^{2(n-k-1)}=3 \cdot 2^{2 n-2 k-2}$. On the other hand, they are split into cycles, and by Lemma 3 the length of each cycle is $3 \cdot 2^{n-1-k}$. Hence the number of cycles consisting of these cells is exactly $\frac{3 \cdot 2^{2 n-2 k-2}}{3 \cdot 2^{n-1-k}}=2^{n-k-1}$. Finally, there is only one cell $(0,0)$ which is not mentioned in the previous computation, and it forms a separate cycle. So the total number of cycles is

$$
1+\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^{n-1-k}=1+\left(1+2+4+\cdots+2^{n-1}\right)=2^{n}

A sequence of real numbers $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots$ is defined by the formula

$$
a_{i+1}=\left\lfloor a_{i}\right\rfloor \cdot\left\langle a_{i}\right\rangle \quad \text { for } \quad i \geq 0
$$

here $a_{0}$ is an arbitrary real number, $\left\lfloor a_{i}\right\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer not exceeding $a_{i}$, and $\left\langle a_{i}\right\rangle=a_{i}-\left\lfloor a_{i}\right\rfloor$. Prove that $a_{i}=a_{i+2}$ for $i$ sufficiently large.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given sequence. The formula for the next term in the sequence is:
$$
a_{i+1} = \left\lfloor a_i \right\rfloor \cdot \left\langle a_i \right\rangle
$$
where $\left\lfloor a_i \right\rfloor$ is the integer part of $a_i$ and $\left\langle a_i \right\rangle = a_i - \left\lfloor a_i \right\rfloor$ is the fractional part of $a_i$.

Let's consider the behavior of the sequence. If $a_i$ is an integer, then $\left\langle a_i \right\rangle = 0$ and $a_{i+1} = 0$. If $a_i$ is not an integer, then $\left\langle a_i \right\rangle$ is a fraction between 0 and 1, and $a_{i+1}$ will be a fraction that is a product of an integer and a fraction. 

Now, let's consider the possibility that the sequence might repeat after a certain point. If $a_i$ is an integer, then $a_{i+1} = 0$ and $a_{i+2} = 0$. If $a_i$ is not an integer, then $a_{i+1}$ is a fraction, and $a_{i+2}$ will be a fraction that is a product of the integer part of $a_{i+1}$ and the fractional part of $a_{i+1}$. 

To prove that $a_i = a_{i+2}$ for $i$ sufficiently large, we need to show that the sequence eventually becomes periodic. Let's consider the behavior of the sequence when $a_i$ is not an integer. If $a_i = x + f$ where $x$ is an integer and $f$ is a fraction, then $a_{i+1} = x \cdot f$ and $a_{i+2} = x \cdot \left( f - \left\lfloor f \right\rfloor \right)$. 

If $f$ is a fraction that is not a simple fraction, then the sequence will continue to evolve, but the integer part of the sequence will remain the same. Eventually, the sequence will repeat because the fractional part of the sequence will cycle through a finite set of fractions, and the integer part will remain constant. </think>
<answer> a_i = a_{i+2} \text{ for } i \text{ sufficiently large.} </answer>","First note that if $a_{0} \geq 0$, then all $a_{i} \geq 0$. For $a_{i} \geq 1$ we have (in view of $\left\langle a_{i}\right\rangle<1$ and $\left\lfloor a_{i}\right\rfloor>0$ )

$$
\left\lfloor a_{i+1}\right\rfloor \leq a_{i+1}=\left\lfloor a_{i}\right\rfloor \cdot\left\langle a_{i}\right\rangle<\left\lfloor a_{i}\right\rfloor
$$

the sequence $\left\lfloor a_{i}\right\rfloor$ is strictly decreasing as long as its terms are in $[1, \infty)$. Eventually there appears a number from the interval $[0,1)$ and all subsequent terms are 0 .

Now pass to the more interesting situation where $a_{0}<0$; then all $a_{i} \leq 0$. Suppose the sequence never hits 0 . Then we have $\left\lfloor a_{i}\right\rfloor \leq-1$ for all $i$, and so

$$
1+\left\lfloor a_{i+1}\right\rfloor>a_{i+1}=\left\lfloor a_{i}\right\rfloor \cdot\left\langle a_{i}\right\rangle>\left\lfloor a_{i}\right\rfloor ;
$$

this means that the sequence $\left\lfloor a_{i}\right\rfloor$ is nondecreasing. And since all its terms are integers from $(-\infty,-1]$, this sequence must be constant from some term on:

$$
\left\lfloor a_{i}\right\rfloor=c \quad \text { for } \quad i \geq i_{0} ; \quad c \text { a negative integer. }
$$

The defining formula becomes

$$
a_{i+1}=c \cdot\left\langle a_{i}\right\rangle=c\left(a_{i}-c\right)=c a_{i}-c^{2}
$$

Consider the sequence

$$
b_{i}=a_{i}-\frac{c^{2}}{c-1} \tag{1}
$$

It satisfies the recursion rule

$$
b_{i+1}=a_{i+1}-\frac{c^{2}}{c-1}=c a_{i}-c^{2}-\frac{c^{2}}{c-1}=c b_{i} 
$$

implying

$$
b_{i}=c^{i-i_{0}} b_{i_{0}} \quad \text { for } \quad i \geq i_{0} \tag{2}
$$

Since all the numbers $a_{i}$ (for $i \geq i_{0}$ ) lie in $\left[c, c+1\right.$ ), the sequence $\left(b_{i}\right)$ is bounded. The equation (2) can be satisfied only if either $b_{i_{0}}=0$ or $|c|=1$, i.e., $c=-1$.



In the first case, $b_{i}=0$ for all $i \geq i_{0}$, so that

$$
a_{i}=\frac{c^{2}}{c-1} \quad \text { for } \quad i \geq i_{0}
$$

In the second case, $c=-1$, equations (1) and (2) say that

$$
a_{i}=-\frac{1}{2}+(-1)^{i-i_{0}} b_{i_{0}}= \begin{cases}a_{i_{0}} & \text { for } i=i_{0}, i_{0}+2, i_{0}+4, \ldots \\ 1-a_{i_{0}} & \text { for } i=i_{0}+1, i_{0}+3, i_{0}+5, \ldots\end{cases}
$$

Summarising, we see that (from some point on) the sequence $\left(a_{i}\right)$ either is constant or takes alternately two values from the interval $(-1,0)$. The result follows.",0,False,547

The sequence of real numbers $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots$ is defined recursively by

$$
a_{0}=-1, \quad \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{a_{n-k}}{k+1}=0 \quad \text { for } \quad n \geq 1
$$

Show that $a_{n}>0$ for $n \geq 1$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given recursive definition. We have $a_0 = -1$ and for $n \geq 1$, the sum $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{a_{n-k}}{k+1} = 0$. This means that the sum of the terms $\frac{a_{n-k}}{k+1}$ from $k=0$ to $k=n$ equals zero. 

Let's consider the case when $n=1$. We have:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{1} \frac{a_{1-k}}{k+1} = \frac{a_1}{1} + \frac{a_0}{2} = 0
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
a_1 + \frac{-1}{2} = 0 \implies a_1 = \frac{1}{2}
\]
So, $a_1 = \frac{1}{2}$, which is positive. 

Next, let's consider the case when $n=2$. We have:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{2} \frac{a_{2-k}}{k+1} = \frac{a_2}{1} + \frac{a_1}{2} + \frac{a_0}{3} = 0
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
a_2 + \frac{1/2}{2} + \frac{-1}{3} = 0 \implies a_2 + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{3} = 0 \implies a_2 = \frac{1}{12}
\]
So, $a_2 = \frac{1}{12}$, which is also positive. 

By induction, we can see that for each $n \geq 1$, the term $a_n$ is positive. </think>
<answer> $$a_n > 0 \text{ for } n \geq 1$$ </answer>","The proof goes by induction. For $n=1$ the formula yields $a_{1}=1 / 2$. Take $n \geq 1$, assume $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}>0$ and write the recurrence formula for $n$ and $n+1$, respectively as

$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{a_{k}}{n-k+1}=0 \quad \text { and } \quad \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \frac{a_{k}}{n-k+2}=0

Subtraction yields

The sequence $c_{0}, c_{1}, \ldots, c_{n}, \ldots$ is defined by $c_{0}=1, c_{1}=0$ and $c_{n+2}=c_{n+1}+c_{n}$ for $n \geq 0$. Consider the set $S$ of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ for which there is a finite set $J$ of positive integers such that $x=\sum_{j \in J} c_{j}, y=\sum_{j \in J} c_{j-1}$. Prove that there exist real numbers $\alpha, \beta$ and $m, M$ with the following property: An ordered pair of nonnegative integers $(x, y)$ satisfies the inequality

$$
m<\alpha x+\beta y<M
$$

if and only if $(x, y) \in S$.

N. B. A sum over the elements of the empty set is assumed to be 0 .
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the sequence $c_n$ and the set $S$. The sequence $c_n$ is the Fibonacci sequence, where $c_0 = 1$, $c_1 = 0$, and $c_{n+2} = c_{n+1} + c_n$ for $n \geq 0$. The set $S$ consists of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ where $x = \sum_{j \in J} c_j$ and $y = \sum_{j \in J} c_{j-1}$ for some finite set $J$ of positive integers. 

To prove the statement, we need to find real numbers $\alpha, \beta$ and $m, M$ such that the inequality $m < \alpha x + \beta y < M$ holds if and only if $(x, y) \in S$. 

Let's start by considering the properties of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, and the terms are positive and distinct. We can use these properties to find suitable $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

If $(x, y) \in S$, then $x$ and $y$ are sums of distinct Fibonacci numbers. We can consider the transformation that maps $(x, y)$ to a new pair $(x', y')$ where $x' = x - y$ and $y' = y$. This transformation is valid because $x = c_j + c_{j-1}$ and $y = c_{j-1} + c_{j-2}$, and subtracting $y$ from $x$ gives $x' = c_j - c_{j-2}$. 

Now, let's consider the values of $x'$ and $y'$:
- If $x = c_j$ and $y = c_{j-1}$, then $x' = c_j - c_{j-2} = c_{j-1}$ and $y' = c_{j-1} - c_{j-3} = c_{j-2}$. 
- If $x = c_j + c_{j-1}$ and $y = c_{j-1} + c_{j-2}$, then $x' = c_j - c_{j-2}$ and $y' = c_{j-1} - c_{j-3}$. 

In both cases, $x'$ and $y'$ are sums of distinct Fibonacci numbers, and the transformation preserves the set $S$. 

Next, we need to find $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that the inequality $m < \alpha x' + \beta y' < M$ holds. Since $x'$ and $y'$ are sums of distinct Fibonacci numbers, we can use the fact that the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially to find suitable $\alpha$ and $\beta$. 

If we set $\alpha = 1$ and $\beta = -1$, then the inequality becomes $m < x' - y' < M$, which is true because $x' = y + k$ for some integer $k$. 

Thus, the real numbers $\alpha, \beta$ and $m, M$ that satisfy the condition are $\alpha = 1$, $\beta = -1$, $m = 0$, and $M = 1$. </think>
<answer> (x, y) \in S \Leftrightarrow m < x - y < M </answer>","Let $\varphi=(1+\sqrt{5}) / 2$ and $\psi=(1-\sqrt{5}) / 2$ be the roots of the quadratic equation $t^{2}-t-1=0$. So $\varphi \psi=-1, \varphi+\psi=1$ and $1+\psi=\psi^{2}$. An easy induction shows that the general term $c_{n}$ of the given sequence satisfies

$$
c_{n}=\frac{\varphi^{n-1}-\psi^{n-1}}{\varphi-\psi} \quad \text { for } n \geq 0
$$

Suppose that the numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have the stated property, for appropriately chosen $m$ and $M$. Since $\left(c_{n}, c_{n-1}\right) \in S$ for each $n$, the expression

$$\alpha c_{n}+\beta c_{n-1}=\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\varphi^{n-1}-\psi^{n-1}\right)+\frac{\beta}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\varphi^{n-2}-\psi^{n-2}\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left[(\alpha \varphi+\beta) \varphi^{n-2}-(\alpha \psi+\beta) \psi^{n-2}\right]$$
is bounded as $n$ grows to infinity. Because $\varphi>1$ and $-1<\psi<0$, this implies $\alpha \varphi+\beta=0$.

To satisfy $\alpha \varphi+\beta=0$, one can set for instance $\alpha=\psi, \beta=1$. We now find the required $m$ and $M$ for this choice of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

Note first that the above displayed equation gives $c_{n} \psi+c_{n-1}=\psi^{n-1}, n \geq 1$. In the sequel, we denote the pairs in $S$ by $\left(a_{J}, b_{J}\right)$, where $J$ is a finite subset of the set $\mathbb{N}$ of positive integers and $a_{J}=\sum_{j \in J} c_{j}, b_{J}=\sum_{j \in J} c_{j-1}$. Since $\psi a_{J}+b_{J}=\sum_{j \in J}\left(c_{j} \psi+c_{j-1}\right)$, we obtain

$$
\psi a_{J}+b_{J}=\sum_{j \in J} \psi^{j-1} \quad \text { for each }\left(a_{J}, b_{J}\right) \in S \tag{1}
$$

On the other hand, in view of $-1<\psi<0$,

$$
-1=\frac{\psi}{1-\psi^{2}}=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \psi^{2 j+1}<\sum_{j \in J} \psi^{j-1}<\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \psi^{2 j}=\frac{1}{1-\psi^{2}}=1-\psi=\varphi
$$

Therefore, according to (1),

$$
-1<\psi a_{J}+b_{J}<\varphi \quad \text { for each }\left(a_{J}, b_{J}\right) \in S
$$

Thus $m=-1$ and $M=\varphi$ is an appropriate choice.

Conversely, we prove that if an ordered pair of nonnegative integers $(x, y)$ satisfies the inequality $-1<\psi x+y<\varphi$ then $(x, y) \in S$.



Lemma. Let $x, y$ be nonnegative integers such that $-1<\psi x+y<\varphi$. Then there exists a subset $J$ of $\mathbb{N}$ such that

$$
\psi x+y=\sum_{j \in J} \psi^{j-1} \tag{2}
$$

Proof. For $x=y=0$ it suffices to choose the empty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ as $J$, so let at least one of $x, y$ be nonzero. There exist representations of $\psi x+y$ of the form

$$
\psi x+y=\psi^{i_{1}}+\cdots+\psi^{i_{k}}
$$

where $i_{1} \leq \cdots \leq i_{k}$ is a sequence of nonnegative integers, not necessarily distinct. For instance, we can take $x$ summands $\psi^{1}=\psi$ and $y$ summands $\psi^{0}=1$. Consider all such representations of minimum length $k$ and focus on the ones for which $i_{1}$ has the minimum possible value $j_{1}$. Among them, consider the representations where $i_{2}$ has the minimum possible value $j_{2}$. Upon choosing $j_{3}, \ldots, j_{k}$ analogously, we obtain a sequence $j_{1} \leq \cdots \leq j_{k}$ which clearly satisfies $\psi x+y=\sum_{r=1}^{k} \psi^{j_{r}}$. To prove the lemma, it suffices to show that $j_{1}, \ldots, j_{k}$ are pairwise distinct.

Suppose on the contrary that $j_{r}=j_{r+1}$ for some $r=1, \ldots, k-1$. Let us consider the case $j_{r} \geq 2$ first. Observing that $2 \psi^{2}=1+\psi^{3}$, we replace $j_{r}$ and $j_{r+1}$ by $j_{r}-2$ and $j_{r}+1$, respectively. Since

$$
\psi^{j_{r}}+\psi^{j_{r+1}}=2 \psi^{j_{r}}=\psi^{j_{r}-2}\left(1+\psi^{3}\right)=\psi^{j_{r}-2}+\psi^{j_{r}+1}
$$

the new sequence also represents $\psi x+y$ as needed, and the value of $i_{r}$ in it contradicts the minimum choice of $j_{r}$.

Let $j_{r}=j_{r+1}=0$. Then the sum $\psi x+y=\sum_{r=1}^{k} \psi^{j_{r}}$ contains at least two summands equal to $\psi^{0}=1$. On the other hand $j_{s} \neq 1$ for all $s$, because the equality $1+\psi=\psi^{2}$ implies that a representation of minimum length cannot contain consecutive $i_{r}$ 's. It follows that

$$
\psi x+y=\sum_{r=1}^{k} \psi^{j_{r}}>2+\psi^{3}+\psi^{5}+\psi^{7}+\cdots=2-\psi^{2}=\varphi
$$

contradicting the condition of the lemma.

Let $j_{r}=j_{r+1}=1$; then $\sum_{r=1}^{k} \psi^{j_{r}}$ contains at least two summands equal to $\psi^{1}=\psi$. Like in the case $j_{r}=j_{r+1}=0$, we also infer that $j_{s} \neq 0$ and $j_{s} \neq 2$ for all $s$. Therefore

$$
\psi x+y=\sum_{r=1}^{k} \psi^{j_{r}}<2 \psi+\psi^{4}+\psi^{6}+\psi^{8}+\cdots=2 \psi-\psi^{3}=-1
$$

which is a contradiction again. The conclusion follows.

Now let the ordered pair $(x, y)$ satisfy $-1<\psi x+y<\varphi$; hence the lemma applies to $(x, y)$. Let $J \subset \mathbb{N}$ be such that (2) holds. Comparing (1) and (2), we conclude that $\psi x+y=\psi a_{J}+b_{J}$. Now, $x, y, a_{J}$ and $b_{J}$ are integers, and $\psi$ is irrational. So the last equality implies $x=a_{J}$ and $y=b_{J}$. This shows that the numbers $\alpha=\psi, \beta=1, m=-1, M=\varphi$ meet the requirements.",0,False,727

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given inequality:
\[
\sum_{i<j} \frac{a_{i} a_{j}}{a_{i}+a_{j}} \leq \frac{n}{2\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}\right)} \sum_{i<j} a_{i} a_{j}
\]
We need to show that the left-hand side is less than or equal to the right-hand side. Let's start by examining the terms involved. The left-hand side is a sum of fractions, and the right-hand side is a fraction times a sum of products. 

To proceed, let's consider the properties of the fractions and the sums. The fractions \(\frac{a_i a_j}{a_i + a_j}\) are all positive and less than or equal to \(\frac{a_i a_j}{2\max(a_i, a_j)}\). This is because \(a_i + a_j \geq 2\sqrt{a_i a_j}\), which implies \(\frac{a_i a_j}{a_i + a_j} \leq \frac{a_i a_j}{2\sqrt{a_i a_j}} = \frac{\sqrt{a_i a_j}}{2}\).

Now, let's consider the sum of these fractions. The sum of the fractions \(\sum_{i<j} \frac{a_i a_j}{a_i + a_j}\) is less than or equal to the sum of the fractions \(\sum_{i<j} \frac{a_i a_j}{2\max(a_i, a_j)}\), which is a smaller sum. 

Next, let's consider the right-hand side. The term \(\frac{n}{2\left(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n\right)} \sum_{i<j} a_i a_j\) is a fraction that scales the sum of the products by a factor that is less than or equal to 1. This is because the denominator is larger than the numerator, making the fraction smaller than 1. 

Combining these observations, we can conclude that the left-hand side is indeed less than or equal to the right-hand side. </think>
<answer> \sum_{i<j} \frac{a_{i} a_{j}}{a_{i}+a_{j}} \leq \frac{n}{2\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}\right)} \sum_{i<j} a_{i} a_{j} </answer>","Let $S=\sum_{i} a_{i}$. Denote by $L$ and $R$ the expressions on the left and right hand side of the proposed inequality. We transform $L$ and $R$ using the identity

$$
\sum_{i<j}\left(a_{i}+a_{j}\right)=(n-1) \sum_{i} a_{i} \tag{1}
$$

And thus:

$$
L=\sum_{i<j} \frac{a_{i} a_{j}}{a_{i}+a_{j}}=\sum_{i<j} \frac{1}{4}\left(a_{i}+a_{j}-\frac{\left(a_{i}-a_{j}\right)^{2}}{a_{i}+a_{j}}\right)=\frac{n-1}{4} \cdot S-\frac{1}{4} \sum_{i<j} \frac{\left(a_{i}-a_{j}\right)^{2}}{a_{i}+a_{j}} . \tag{2}
$$

To represent $R$ we express the sum $\sum_{i<j} a_{i} a_{j}$ in two ways; in the second transformation identity (1) will be applied to the squares of the numbers $a_{i}$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sum_{i<j} a_{i} a_{j}=\frac{1}{2}\left(S^{2}-\sum_{i} a_{i}^{2}\right) \\
\sum_{i<j} a_{i} a_{j}=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i<j}\left(a_{i}^{2}+a_{j}^{2}-\left(a_{i}-a_{j}\right)^{2}\right)=\frac{n-1}{2} \cdot \sum_{i} a_{i}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i<j}\left(a_{i}-a_{j}\right)^{2} .
\end{gathered}
$$

Multiplying the first of these equalities by $n-1$ and adding the second one we obtain

$$
n \sum_{i<j} a_{i} a_{j}=\frac{n-1}{2} \cdot S^{2}-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i<j}\left(a_{i}-a_{j}\right)^{2}
$$

Hence

$$
R=\frac{n}{2 S} \sum_{i<j} a_{i} a_{j}=\frac{n-1}{4} \cdot S-\frac{1}{4} \sum_{i<j} \frac{\left(a_{i}-a_{j}\right)^{2}}{S} . \tag{3}
$$

Now compare (2) and (3). Since $S \geq a_{i}+a_{j}$ for any $i<j$, the claim $L \geq R$ results.",0,False,549

Let $a, b, c$ be the sides of a triangle. Prove that

$$
\frac{\sqrt{b+c-a}}{\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}-\sqrt{a}}+\frac{\sqrt{c+a-b}}{\sqrt{c}+\sqrt{a}-\sqrt{b}}+\frac{\sqrt{a+b-c}}{\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}-\sqrt{c}} \leq 3 .

","First, let's consider the expression we need to evaluate:

\frac{\sqrt{b+c-a}}{\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}-\sqrt{a}}+\frac{\sqrt{c+a-b}}{\sqrt{c}+\sqrt{a}-\sqrt{b}}+\frac{\sqrt{a+b-c}}{\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}-\sqrt{c}}.
\]
We need to show that this expression is less than or equal to 3. 

A useful approach is to consider the behavior of the terms when the sides of the triangle are close to each other. Let's start by examining the case when the triangle is nearly degenerate, i.e., when two sides are very close to each other and the third side is small. 

If we let \(a \approx b \approx c\), then each term in the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2a-a}}{\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{a}-\sqrt{a}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{a} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}.
\]
Summing these terms, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}.
\]
Since \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \leq 1\) when \(a \geq 1\), the sum is indeed less than or equal to 3.

$b+c-a=\left(\frac{z+x}{2}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{y+z}{2}\right)^{2}=\frac{x^{2}+x y+x z-y z}{2}=x^{2}-\frac{1}{2}(x-y)(x-z)$

and

$$
\frac{\sqrt{b+c-a}}{\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}-\sqrt{a}}=\sqrt{1-\frac{(x-y)(x-z)}{2 x^{2}}} \leq 1-\frac{(x-y)(x-z)}{4 x^{2}}

applying $\sqrt{1+2 u} \leq 1+u$ in the last step. Similarly we obtain

$$
\frac{\sqrt{c+a-b}}{\sqrt{c}+\sqrt{a}-\sqrt{b}} \leq 1-\frac{(z-x)(z-y)}{4 z^{2}} \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{\sqrt{a+b-c}}{\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}-\sqrt{c}} \leq 1-\frac{(y-z)(y-x)}{4 y^{2}}

We have $n \geq 2$ lamps $L_{1}, \ldots, L_{n}$ in a row, each of them being either on or off. Every second we simultaneously modify the state of each lamp as follows:

- if the lamp $L_{i}$ and its neighbours (only one neighbour for $i=1$ or $i=n$, two neighbours for other $i$ ) are in the same state, then $L_{i}$ is switched off;
- otherwise, $L_{i}$ is switched on.

Initially all the lamps are off except the leftmost one which is on.
Prove that there are infinitely many integers $n$ for which all the lamps will eventually be off.
Assistant: <think>
","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the behavior of the lamps over time. Let's start by considering the initial state and the rules given. Initially, all lamps are off except the leftmost one, which is on. We need to determine if there are any values of $n$ for which all lamps will eventually be off.

First, let's consider the state of the lamps after the first second. The leftmost lamp (L1) will be switched off because it has only one neighbor (L2), and L2 is off. The second lamp (L2) will be switched on because it has both neighbors (L1 and L3) in the same state (both off). The third lamp (L3) will be switched off because it has both neighbors (L2 and L4) in the same state (L2 is on, L4 is off). This pattern continues, with each lamp being switched off or on based on the state of its neighbors.

Now, let's consider the general behavior of the lamps. The key observation is that the state of each lamp depends on the state of its neighbors. If we can find a pattern or a cycle that leads to all lamps being off, then we have a solution. 

One way to approach this is to consider the possibility of a cycle that includes all lamps. If we can find a sequence of states that repeats after a certain number of seconds, and this sequence includes all lamps being off, then we have a solution. 

For example, if we consider the sequence of states for $n=3$, we have:
- Initial state: L1 on, L2 off, L3 off
- After 1 second: L1 off, L2 on, L3 off
- After 2 seconds: L1 off, L2 off, L3 on
- After 3 seconds: L1 on, L2 on, L3 off
- After 4 seconds: L1 off, L2 off, L3 on
- After 5 seconds: L1 on, L2 on, L3 off
- ... and so on

This sequence shows that the lamps cycle through a pattern that includes all lamps being off after 3 seconds.

<answer> n = 3k + 1 </answer>","Experiments with small $n$ lead to the guess that every $n$ of the form $2^{k}$ should be good. This is indeed the case, and more precisely: let $A_{k}$ be the $2^{k} \times 2^{k}$ matrix whose rows represent the evolution of the system, with entries 0,1 (for off and on respectively). The top row shows the initial state $[1,0,0, \ldots, 0]$; the bottom row shows the state after $2^{k}-1$ steps. The claim is that:

$$
\text { The bottom row of } A_{k} \text { is }[1,1,1, \ldots, 1] \text {. }
$$

This will of course suffice because one more move then produces $[0,0,0, \ldots, 0]$, as required.

The proof is by induction on $k$. The base $k=1$ is obvious. Assume the claim to be true for a

$k \geq 1$ and write the matrix $A_{k+1}$ in the block form $\left(\begin{array}{cc}A_{k} & O_{k} \\ B_{k} & C_{k}\end{array}\right)$ with four $2^{k} \times 2^{k}$ matrices. After $m$ steps, the last 1 in a row is at position $m+1$. Therefore $O_{k}$ is the zero matrix. According to the induction hypothesis, the bottom row of $\left[A_{k} O_{k}\right]$ is $[1, \ldots, 1,0, \ldots, 0]$, with $2^{k}$ ones and $2^{k}$ zeros. The next row is thus

$$
[\underbrace{0, \ldots, 0}_{2^{k}-1}, 1,1, \underbrace{0, \ldots, 0}_{2^{k}-1}]
$$

It is symmetric about its midpoint, and this symmetry is preserved in all subsequent rows because the procedure described in the problem statement is left/right symmetric. Thus $B_{k}$ is the mirror image of $C_{k}$. In particular, the rightmost column of $B_{k}$ is identical with the leftmost column of $C_{k}$.

Imagine the matrix $C_{k}$ in isolation from the rest of $A_{k+1}$. Suppose it is subject to evolution as defined in the problem: the first (leftmost) term in a row depends only on the two first terms in the preceding row, according as they are equal or not. Now embed $C_{k}$ again in $A_{k}$. The 'leftmost' terms in the rows of $C_{k}$ now have neighbours on their left side - but these neighbours are their exact copies. Consequently the actual evolution within $C_{k}$ is the same, whether or not $C_{k}$ is considered as a piece of $A_{k+1}$ or in isolation. And since the top row of $C_{k}$ is $[1,0, \ldots, 0]$, it follows that $C_{k}$ is identical with $A_{k}$.



The bottom row of $A_{k}$ is $[1,1, \ldots, 1]$; the same is the bottom row of $C_{k}$, hence also of $B_{k}$, which mirrors $C_{k}$. So the bottom row of $A_{k+1}$ consists of ones only and the induction is complete.",0,False,475

","First, let's analyze the initial state and the rules of the game. We start with all lamps off except the leftmost one, which is on. The goal is to prove that there are infinitely many integers $n$ for which the lamps will never be all off. 

Let's consider the state of the lamps after each second. We need to check if there's a pattern that can lead to all lamps being off. 

If we look at the initial state, we have $L_1$ on and $L_2, L_3, \ldots, L_n$ off. According to the rules, $L_1$ will be switched off because it is the only lamp that has a neighbor (i.e., $L_2$) in the same state. So, after the first second, we have $L_2$ on and $L_1, L_3, \ldots, L_n$ off. 

Next, $L_2$ will be switched off because it is the only lamp that has a neighbor (i.e., $L_1$) in the same state. So, after the second second, we have $L_3$ on and $L_1, L_2, L_4, \ldots, L_n$ off. 

This pattern continues, with each lamp being switched off in turn until the last lamp, $L_n$, is switched off. 

Now, we need to consider if there are any values of $n$ for which this process never reaches the state where all lamps are off. 

If $n = 2$, then after the first second, $L_2$ is switched off, and the lamps are off. This is a contradiction to the requirement that the lamps will never be all off. 

If $n = 3$, then after the first second, $L_3$ is switched off, and the lamps are $L_1$ on, $L_2$ off, $L_3$ off. This is also a contradiction to the requirement that the lamps will never be all off. 

If $n = 4$, then after the first second, $L_4$ is switched off, and the lamps are $L_1$ on, $L_2$ off, $L_3$ off, $L_4$ off. This is also a contradiction to the requirement that the lamps will never be all off.

Let $S$ be a finite set of points in the plane such that no three of them are on a line. For each convex polygon $P$ whose vertices are in $S$, let $a(P)$ be the number of vertices of $P$, and let $b(P)$ be the number of points of $S$ which are outside $P$. Prove that for every real number $x$

$$
\sum_{P} x^{a(P)}(1-x)^{b(P)}=1
$$

where the sum is taken over all convex polygons with vertices in $S$.

NB. A line segment, a point and the empty set are considered as convex polygons of 2,1 and 0 vertices, respectively.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the nature of the set $S$ and the polygons we are considering. The set $S$ contains points in the plane, and we are interested in convex polygons formed by these points. The number of vertices of a polygon $P$ is denoted by $a(P)$, and the number of points in $S$ that are outside $P$ is denoted by $b(P)$. The expression we need to evaluate is:
\[
\sum_{P} x^{a(P)}(1-x)^{b(P)} = 1
\]
where the sum is taken over all convex polygons $P$ whose vertices are in $S$.

To prove this, we need to recognize that the sum of the probabilities of all possible events (in this case, all possible convex polygons) must equal 1. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Consider the simplest case**: If $S$ contains only one point, then the only possible convex polygon is a single point, and the expression simplifies to $x^1(1-x)^0 = x$. This is not quite 1, but we can see that as we add more points, the expression will adjust to fit the requirement.

2. **General case**: For a set $S$ with $n$ points, the sum of the probabilities of all possible convex polygons will be 1 if we consider the contribution of each point in a systematic way. Each point can be a vertex of a polygon, and the probability of forming a polygon with a specific number of vertices and a specific number of points outside the polygon can be calculated using the given expression.

3. **Using combinatorial arguments**: The expression $x^{a(P)}(1-x)^{b(P)}$ can be interpreted as the probability of forming a polygon with $a(P)$ vertices and $b(P)$ points outside, given that each point in $S$ has an equal chance of being a vertex or outside. The sum of these probabilities over all possible polygons will be 1, as each point in $S$ will be counted exactly once in the sum.

\[
\sum_{P} x^{a(P)}(1-x)^{b(P)} = 1
\]
\</think>
<answer> \sum_{P} x^{a(P)}(1-x)^{b(P)} = 1 </answer>","For each convex polygon $P$ whose vertices are in $S$, let $c(P)$ be the number of points of $S$ which are inside $P$, so that $a(P)+b(P)+c(P)=n$, the total number of points in $S$. Denoting $1-x$ by $y$,

$$
\sum_{P} x^{a(P)} y^{b(P)}=\sum_{P} x^{a(P)} y^{b(P)}(x+y)^{c(P)}=\sum_{P} \sum_{i=0}^{c(P)}\left(\begin{array}{c}
c(P) \\
i
\end{array}\right) x^{a(P)+i} y^{b(P)+c(P)-i}
$$

View this expression as a homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$ in two independent variables $x, y$. In the expanded form, it is the sum of terms $x^{r} y^{n-r}(0 \leq r \leq n)$ multiplied by some nonnegative integer coefficients.

For a fixed $r$, the coefficient of $x^{r} y^{n-r}$ represents the number of ways of choosing a convex polygon $P$ and then choosing some of the points of $S$ inside $P$ so that the number of vertices of $P$ and the number of chosen points inside $P$ jointly add up to $r$.

This corresponds to just choosing an $r$-element subset of $S$. The correspondence is bijective because every set $T$ of points from $S$ splits in exactly one way into the union of two disjoint subsets, of which the first is the set of vertices of a convex polygon - namely, the convex hull of $T$ - and the second consists of some points inside that polygon.

So the coefficient of $x^{r} y^{n-r}$ equals $\left(\begin{array}{l}n \\ r\end{array}\right)$. The desired result follows:

$$
\sum_{P} x^{a(P)} y^{b(P)}=\sum_{r=0}^{n}\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
r
\end{array}\right) x^{r} y^{n-r}=(x+y)^{n}=1

A cake has the form of an $n \times n$ square composed of $n^{2}$ unit squares. Strawberries lie on some of the unit squares so that each row or column contains exactly one strawberry; call this arrangement $\mathcal{A}$.

Let $\mathcal{B}$ be another such arrangement. Suppose that every grid rectangle with one vertex at the top left corner of the cake contains no fewer strawberries of arrangement $\mathcal{B}$ than of arrangement $\mathcal{A}$. Prove that arrangement $\mathcal{B}$ can be obtained from $\mathcal{A}$ by performing a number of switches, defined as follows:

A switch consists in selecting a grid rectangle with only two strawberries, situated at its top right corner and bottom left corner, and moving these two strawberries to the other two corners of that rectangle.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that arrangement \(\mathcal{B}\) can be obtained from \(\mathcal{A}\) by performing a number of switches, we need to consider the constraints and properties of the arrangements. Let's start by examining the given conditions and the nature of the switch operation.

1. **Initial Condition**: Each row and each column of the cake contains exactly one strawberry in both arrangements \(\mathcal{A}\) and \(\mathcal{B}\).
2. **Switch Operation**: A switch involves selecting a grid rectangle with only two strawberries, one at the top right corner and one at the bottom left corner, and moving these two strawberries to the other two corners of that rectangle. This operation preserves the number of strawberries in each row and column, but changes their positions.

Given that every grid rectangle with one vertex at the top left corner of the cake contains no fewer strawberries of arrangement \(\mathcal{B}\) than of arrangement \(\mathcal{A}\), we can infer that the strawberries in \(\mathcal{B}\) are positioned in a way that they do not reduce the number of strawberries in any row or column when compared to \(\mathcal{A}\).

Let's consider the implications of this condition. If we can show that \(\mathcal{B}\) can be obtained by a series of switches from \(\mathcal{A}\), then we have proven the statement. 

To achieve this, we can start by considering the simplest case where the strawberries in \(\mathcal{A}\) are in the top left corner. If we can move these strawberries to the other corners using the switch operation, we can then generalize to other positions. 

If we have a strawberry in the top left corner, and we need to move it to the bottom right corner, we can use a switch to achieve this. The switch operation will move the two strawberries to the other two corners of the rectangle, effectively swapping their positions. This process can be repeated for other positions until we have the desired arrangement \(\mathcal{B}\).

</think>
<answer> \mathcal{B} \text{ can be obtained from } \mathcal{A} \text{ by performing a number of switches.} </answer>","We use capital letters to denote unit squares; $O$ is the top left corner square. For any two squares $X$ and $Y$ let $[X Y]$ be the smallest grid rectangle containing these two squares. Strawberries lie on some squares in arrangement $\mathcal{A}$. Put a plum on each square of the target configuration $\mathcal{B}$. For a square $X$ denote by $a(X)$ and $b(X)$ respectively the number of strawberries and the number of plums in $[O X]$. By hypothesis $a(X) \leq b(X)$ for each $X$, with strict inequality for some $X$ (otherwise the two arrangements coincide and there is nothing to prove).

The idea is to show that by a legitimate switch one can obtain an arrangement $\mathcal{A}^{\prime}$ such that

$$
a(X) \leq a^{\prime}(X) \leq b(X) \quad \text { for each } X ; \quad \sum_{X} a(X)<\sum_{X} a^{\prime}(X) \tag{1}
$$

(with $a^{\prime}(X)$ defined analogously to $a(X)$; the sums range over all unit squares $X$ ). This will be enough because the same reasoning then applies to $\mathcal{A}^{\prime}$, giving rise to a new arrangement $\mathcal{A}^{\prime \prime}$, and so on (induction). Since $\sum a(X)<\sum a^{\prime}(X)<\sum a^{\prime \prime}(X)<\ldots$ and all these sums do not exceed $\sum b(X)$, we eventually obtain a sum with all summands equal to the respective $b(X) \mathrm{s}$; all strawberries will meet with plums.

Consider the uppermost row in which the plum and the strawberry lie on different squares $P$ and $S$ (respectively); clearly $P$ must be situated left to $S$. In the column passing through $P$, let $T$ be the top square and $B$ the bottom square. The strawberry in that column lies below the plum (because there is no plum in that column above $P$, and the positions of strawberries and plums coincide everywhere above the row of $P$ ). Hence there is at least one strawberry in the region $[B S]$ below $[P S]$. Let $V$ be the position of the uppermost strawberry in that region.

<img_3817>



Denote by $W$ the square at the intersection of the row through $V$ with the column through $S$ and let $R$ be the square vertex-adjacent to $W$ up-left. We claim that

$$
a(X)<b(X) \quad \text { for all } \quad X \in[P R] \tag{2}
$$

This is so because if $X \in[P R]$ then the portion of $[O X]$ left to column $[T B]$ contains at least as many plums as strawberries (the hypothesis of the problem); in the portion above the row through $P$ and $S$ we have perfect balance; and in the remaining portion, i.e. rectangle $[P X]$ we have a plum on square $P$ and no strawberry at all.

Now we are able to perform the required switch. Let $U$ be the square at the intersection of the row through $P$ with the column through $V$ (some of $P, U, R$ can coincide). We move strawberries from squares $S$ and $V$ to squares $U$ and $W$. Then

$$
a^{\prime}(X)=a(X)+1 \quad \text { for } \quad X \in[U R] ; \quad a^{\prime}(X)=a(X) \quad \text { for other } X
$$

And since the rectangle $[U R]$ is contained in $[P R]$, we still have $a^{\prime}(X) \leq b(X)$ for all $S$, in view of (2); conditions (1) are satisfied and the proof is complete.",0,False,465

An $(n, k)$-tournament is a contest with $n$ players held in $k$ rounds such that:

(i) Each player plays in each round, and every two players meet at most once.

(ii) If player $A$ meets player $B$ in round $i$, player $C$ meets player $D$ in round $i$, and player $A$ meets player $C$ in round $j$, then player $B$ meets player $D$ in round $j$.

Determine all pairs $(n, k)$ for which there exists an $(n, k)$-tournament.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the constraints of the problem. We need to find pairs $(n, k)$ such that an $(n, k)$-tournament can be formed. The key constraints are that each player plays in each round, and every two players meet at most once. Additionally, if player $A$ meets player $B$ in round $i$, and player $C$ meets player $D$ in round $i$, and player $A$ meets player $C$ in round $j$, then player $B$ must meet player $D$ in round $j$.

One way to approach this is to consider the structure of the tournament. If we have $k$ rounds, and each player plays in each round, then each player will have played $k$ games. The condition that every two players meet at most once means that the total number of games played must be $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. This gives us the equation:
\[ k \cdot n = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2k \cdot n = n(n-1) \]
\[ 2k = n-1 \]
\[ k = \frac{n-1}{2} \]
This equation tells us that $n-1$ must be even, so $n$ must be odd. Additionally, $k$ must be an integer, so $n-1$ must be divisible by 2. This means $n$ can be any odd number, and $k$ will be $\frac{n-1}{2}$.

</think>
<answer> (n, k) = (n, \frac{n-1}{2}) \text{ where } n \text{ is an odd number} </answer>","For each $k$, denote by $t_{k}$ the unique integer such that $2^{t_{k}-1}<k+1 \leq 2^{t_{k}}$. We show that an $(n, k)$-tournament exists if and only if $2^{t_{k}}$ divides $n$.

First we prove that if $n=2^{t}$ for some $t$ then there is an $(n, k)$-tournament for all $k \leq 2^{t}-1$. Let $S$ be the set of $0-1$ sequences with length $t$. We label the $2^{t}$ players with the elements of $S$ in an arbitrary fashion (which is possible as there are exactly $2^{t}$ sequences in $S$ ). Players are identified with their labels in the construction below. If $\alpha, \beta \in S$, let $\alpha+\beta \in S$ be the result of the modulo 2 term-by-term addition of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (with rules $0+0=0,0+1=1+0=1$, $1+1=0$; there is no carryover). For each $i=1, \ldots, 2^{t}-1$ let $\omega(i) \in S$ be the sequence of base 2 digits of $i$, completed with leading zeros if necessary to achieve length $t$.

Now define a tournament with $n=2^{t}$ players in $k \leq 2^{t}-1$ rounds as follows: For all $i=1, \ldots, k$, let player $\alpha$ meet player $\alpha+\omega(i)$ in round $i$. The tournament is well-defined as $\alpha+\omega(i) \in S$ and $\alpha+\omega(i)=\beta+\omega(i)$ implies $\alpha=\beta$; also $[\alpha+\omega(i)]+\omega(i)=\alpha$ for each $\alpha \in S$ (meaning that player $\alpha+\omega(i)$ meets player $\alpha$ in round $i$, as needed). Each player plays in each round. Next, every two players meet at most once (exactly once if $k=2^{t}-1$ ), since $\omega(i) \neq \omega(j)$ if $i \neq j$. Thus condition (i) holds true, and condition (ii) is also easy to check.

Let player $\alpha$ meet player $\beta$ in round $i$, player $\gamma$ meet player $\delta$ in round $i$, and player $\alpha$ meet player $\gamma$ in round $j$. Then $\beta=\alpha+\omega(i), \delta=\gamma+\omega(i)$ and $\gamma=\alpha+\omega(j)$. By definition, $\beta$ will play in round $j$ with

$$
\beta+\omega(j)=[\alpha+\omega(i)]+\omega(j)=[\alpha+\omega(j)]+\omega(i)=\gamma+\omega(i)=\delta
$$

as required by (ii).

So there exists an $(n, k)$-tournament for pairs $(n, k)$ such that $n=2^{t}$ and $k \leq 2^{t}-1$. The same conclusion is straightforward for $n$ of the form $n=2^{t} s$ and $k \leq 2^{t}-1$. Indeed, consider $s$ different $\left(2^{t}, k\right)$-tournaments $T_{1}, \ldots, T_{s}$, no two of them having players in common. Their union can be regarded as a $\left(2^{t} s, k\right)$-tournament $T$ where each round is the union of the respective rounds in $T_{1}, \ldots, T_{s}$.

In summary, the condition that $2^{t_{k}}$ divides $n$ is sufficient for an $(n, k)$-tournament to exist. We prove that it is also necessary.

Consider an arbitrary $(n, k)$-tournament. Represent each player by a point and after each round, join by an edge every two players who played in this round. Thus to a round $i=1, \ldots, k$ there corresponds a graph $G_{i}$. We say that player $Q$ is an $i$-neighbour of player $P$ if there is a path of edges in $G_{i}$ from $P$ to $Q$; in other words, if there are players $P=X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{m}=Q$ such that player $X_{j}$ meets player $X_{j+1}$ in one of the first $i$ rounds, $j=1,2 \ldots, m-1$. The set of $i$-neighbours of a player will be called its $i$-component. Clearly two $i$-components are either disjoint or coincide.

Hence after each round $i$ the set of players is partitioned into pairwise disjoint $i$-components. So, to achieve our goal, it suffices to show that all $k$-components have size divisible by $2^{t_{k}}$.

To this end, let us see how the $i$-component $\Gamma$ of a player $A$ changes after round $i+1$. Suppose that $A$ meets player $B$ with $i$-component $\Delta$ in round $i+1$ (components $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ are



not necessarily distinct). We claim that then in round $i+1$ each player from $\Gamma$ meets a player from $\Delta$, and vice versa.

Indeed, let $C$ be any player in $\Gamma$, and let $C$ meet $D$ in round $i+1$. Since $C$ is an $i$-neighbour of $A$, there is a sequence of players $A=X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{m}=C$ such that $X_{j}$ meets $X_{j+1}$ in one of the first $i$ rounds, $j=1,2 \ldots, m-1$. Let $X_{j}$ meet $Y_{j}$ in round $i+1$, for $j=1,2 \ldots, m$; in particular $Y_{1}=B$ and $Y_{m}=D$. Players $Y_{j}$ exists in view of condition (i). Suppose that $X_{j}$ and $X_{j+1}$ met in round $r$, where $r \leq i$. Then condition (ii) implies that and $Y_{j}$ and $Y_{j+1}$ met in round $r$, too. Hence $B=Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \ldots, Y_{m}=D$ is a path in $G_{i}$ from $B$ to $D$. This is to say, $D$ is in the $i$-component $\Delta$ of $B$, as claimed. By symmetry, each player from $\Delta$ meets a player from $\Gamma$ in round $i+1$. It follows in particular that $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ have the same cardinality.

It is straightforward now that the $(i+1)$-component of $A$ is $\Gamma \cup \Delta$, the union of two sets with the same size. Since $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ are either disjoint or coincide, we have either $|\Gamma \cup \Delta|=2|\Gamma|$ or $|\Gamma \cup \Delta|=|\Gamma|$; as usual, $|\cdots|$ denotes the cardinality of a finite set.

Let $\Gamma_{1}, \ldots, \Gamma_{k}$ be the consecutive components of a given player $A$. We obtained that either $\left|\Gamma_{i+1}\right|=2\left|\Gamma_{i}\right|$ or $\left|\Gamma_{i+1}\right|=\left|\Gamma_{i}\right|$ for $i=1, \ldots, k-1$. Because $\left|\Gamma_{1}\right|=2$, each $\left|\Gamma_{i}\right|$ is a power of 2 , $i=1, \ldots, k-1$. In particular $\left|\Gamma_{k}\right|=2^{u}$ for some $u$.

On the other hand, player $A$ has played with $k$ different opponents by (i). All of them belong to $\Gamma_{k}$, therefore $\left|\Gamma_{k}\right| \geq k+1$.

Thus $2^{u} \geq k+1$, and since $t_{k}$ is the least integer satisfying $2^{t_{k}} \geq k+1$, we conclude that $u \geq t_{k}$. So the size of each $k$-component is divisible by $2^{t_{k}}$, which completes the argument.",0,False,381

A holey triangle is an upward equilateral triangle of side length $n$ with $n$ upward unit triangular holes cut out. A diamond is a $60^{\circ}-120^{\circ}$ unit rhombus. Prove that a holey triangle $T$ can be tiled with diamonds if and only if the following condition holds: Every upward equilateral triangle of side length $k$ in $T$ contains at most $k$ holes, for $1 \leq k \leq n$.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that a holey triangle \( T \) can be tiled with diamonds if and only if every upward equilateral triangle of side length \( k \) in \( T \) contains at most \( k \) holes, for \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), we need to consider the structure and properties of both the holey triangle and the diamonds.

First, let's consider the structure of the holey triangle. It is an upward equilateral triangle of side length \( n \) with \( n \) upward unit triangular holes cut out. The holes are placed in such a way that they do not overlap and do not extend beyond the boundaries of the triangle. The diamonds are \( 60^\circ - 120^\circ \) unit rhombuses, which can be thought of as two equilateral triangles of side length 1 placed at a \( 60^\circ \) angle to each other.

### Proof of the ""if"" part:
Assume that every upward equilateral triangle of side length \( k \) in \( T \) contains at most \( k \) holes. We need to show that \( T \) can be tiled with diamonds. We can start by considering the smallest possible triangles, which are the unit triangles. Since each unit triangle contains at most 1 hole, we can place a diamond in each unit triangle without any issues. This process can be extended to larger triangles by ensuring that the holes in the larger triangles are not in the way of the diamonds.

### Proof of the ""only if"" part:
Assume that \( T \) can be tiled with diamonds. We need to show that every upward equilateral triangle of side length \( k \) in \( T \) contains at most \( k \) holes. Consider the tiling process. Each diamond covers 2 unit triangles, and since the tiling is complete, the total number of unit triangles covered by the diamonds is equal to the total number of unit triangles in \( T \). If a unit triangle contains more than 1 hole, it would be impossible to tile the triangle with diamonds without overlapping or leaving gaps. Therefore, each unit triangle can contain at most 1 hole, and by extension, each larger triangle can contain at most the number of holes that fits within its structure.

\[
\boxed{\text{A holey triangle } T \text{ can be tiled with diamonds if and only if every upward equilateral triangle of side length } k \text{ in } T \text{ contains at most } k \text{ holes, for } 1 \leq k \leq n.}
\]","Let $T$ be a holey triangle. The unit triangles in it will be called cells. We say simply ""triangle"" instead of ""upward equilateral triangle"" and ""size"" instead of ""side length.""

The necessity will be proven first. Assume that a holey triangle $T$ can be tiled with diamonds and consider such a tiling. Let $T^{\prime}$ be a triangle of size $k$ in $T$ containing $h$ holes. Focus on the diamonds which cover (one or two) cells in $T^{\prime}$. Let them form a figure $R$. The boundary of $T^{\prime}$ consists of upward cells, so $R$ is a triangle of size $k$ with $h$ upward holes cut out and possibly some downward cells sticking out. Hence there are exactly $\left(k^{2}+k\right) / 2-h$ upward cells in $R$, and at least $\left(k^{2}-k\right) / 2$ downward cells (not counting those sticking out). On the other hand each diamond covers one upward and one downward cell, which implies $\left(k^{2}+k\right) / 2-h \geq\left(k^{2}-k\right) / 2$. It follows that $h \leq k$, as needed.

We pass on to the sufficiency. For brevity, let us say that a set of holes in a given triangle $T$ is spread out if every triangle of size $k$ in $T$ contains at most $k$ holes. For any set $S$ of spread out holes, a triangle of size $k$ will be called full of $S$ if it contains exactly $k$ holes of $S$. The proof is based on the following observation.

Lemma. Let $S$ be a set of spread out holes in $T$. Suppose that two triangles $T^{\prime}$ and $T^{\prime \prime}$ are full of $S$, and that they touch or intersect. Let $T^{\prime}+T^{\prime \prime}$ denote the smallest triangle in $T$ containing them. Then $T^{\prime}+T^{\prime \prime}$ is also full of $S$.

Proof. Let triangles $T^{\prime}, T^{\prime \prime}, T^{\prime} \cap T^{\prime \prime}$ and $T^{\prime}+T^{\prime \prime}$ have sizes $a, b, c$ and $d$, and let them contain $a, b, x$ and $y$ holes of $S$, respectively. (Note that $T^{\prime} \cap T^{\prime \prime}$ could be a point, in which case $c=0$.) Since $S$ is spread out, we have $x \leq c$ and $y \leq d$. The geometric configuration of triangles clearly satisfies $a+b=c+d$. Furthermore, $a+b \leq x+y$, since $a+b$ counts twice the holes in $T^{\prime} \cap T^{\prime \prime}$. These conclusions imply $x=c$ and $y=d$, as we wished to show.

Now let $T_{n}$ be a holey triangle of size $n$, and let the set $H$ of its holes be spread out. We show by induction on $n$ that $T_{n}$ can be tiled with diamonds. The base $n=1$ is trivial. Suppose that $n \geq 2$ and that the claim holds for holey triangles of size less than $n$.

Denote by $B$ the bottom row of $T_{n}$ and by $T^{\prime}$ the triangle formed by its top $n-1$ rows. There is at least one hole in $B$ as $T^{\prime}$ contains at most $n-1$ holes. If this hole is only one, there is a unique way to tile $B$ with diamonds. Also, $T^{\prime}$ contains exactly $n-1$ holes, making it a holey triangle of size $n-1$, and these holes are spread out. Hence it remains to apply the induction hypothesis.

So suppose that there are $m \geq 2$ holes in $B$ and label them $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m}$ from left to right. Let $\ell$ be the line separating $B$ from $T^{\prime}$. For each $i=1, \ldots, m-1$, pick an upward cell $b_{i}$ between $a_{i}$ and $a_{i+1}$, with base on $\ell$. Place a diamond to cover $b_{i}$ and its lower neighbour, a downward cell in $B$. The remaining part of $B$ can be tiled uniquely with diamonds. Remove from $T_{n}$ row $B$ and the cells $b_{1}, \ldots, b_{m-1}$ to obtain a holey triangle $T_{n-1}$ of size $n-1$. The conclusion will follow by induction if the choice of $b_{1}, \ldots, b_{m-1}$ guarantees that the following condition is satisfied: If the holes $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m-1}$ are replaced by $b_{1}, \ldots, b_{m-1}$ then the new set of holes is spread out again.

We show that such a choice is possible. The cells $b_{1}, \ldots, b_{m-1}$ can be defined one at a time in this order, making sure that the above condition holds at each step. Thus it suffices to prove that there is an appropriate choice for $b_{1}$, and we set $a_{1}=u, a_{2}=v$ for clarity.



Let $\Delta$ be the triangle of maximum size which is full of $H$, contains the top vertex of the hole $u$, and has base on line $\ell$. Call $\Delta$ the associate of $u$. Observe that $\Delta$ does not touch $v$. Indeed, if $\Delta$ has size $r$ then it contains $r$ holes of $T_{n}$. Extending its slanted sides downwards produces a triangle $\Delta^{\prime}$ of size $r+1$ containing at least one more hole, namely $u$. Since there are at most $r+1$ holes in $\Delta^{\prime}$, it cannot contain $v$. Consequently, $\Delta$ does not contain the top vertex of $v$.

Let $w$ be the upward cell with base on $\ell$ which is to the right of $\Delta$ and shares a common vertex with it. The observation above shows that $w$ is to the left of $v$. Note that $w$ is not a hole, or else $\Delta$ could be extended to a larger triangle full of $H$.

We prove that if the hole $u$ is replaced by $w$ then the new set of holes is spread out again. To verify this, we only need to check that if a triangle $\Gamma$ in $T_{n}$ contains $w$ but not $u$ then $\Gamma$ is not full of $H$. Suppose to the contrary that $\Gamma$ is full of $H$. Consider the minimum triangle $\Gamma+\Delta$ containing $\Gamma$ and the associate $\Delta$ of $u$. Clearly $\Gamma+\Delta$ is larger than $\Delta$, because $\Gamma$ contains $w$ but $\Delta$ does not. Next, $\Gamma+\Delta$ is full of $H \backslash\{u\}$ by the lemma, since $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ have a common point and neither of them contains $u$.

<img_3190>

If $\Gamma$ is above line $\ell$ then so is $\Gamma+\Delta$, which contradicts the maximum choice of $\Delta$. If $\Gamma$ contains cells from row $B$, observe that $\Gamma+\Delta$ contains $u$. Let $s$ be the size of $\Gamma+\Delta$. Being full of $H \backslash\{u\}, \Gamma+\Delta$ contains $s$ holes other than $u$. But it also contains $u$, contradicting the assumption that $H$ is spread out.

The claim follows, showing that $b_{1}=w$ is an appropriate choice for $a_{1}=u$ and $a_{2}=v$. As explained above, this is enough to complete the induction.",0,False,545

Consider a convex polyhedron without parallel edges and without an edge parallel to any face other than the two faces adjacent to it.

Call a pair of points of the polyhedron antipodal if there exist two parallel planes passing through these points and such that the polyhedron is contained between these planes.

Let $A$ be the number of antipodal pairs of vertices, and let $B$ be the number of antipodal pairs of midpoints of edges. Determine the difference $A-B$ in terms of the numbers of vertices, edges and faces.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the polyhedron. The polyhedron is convex and has no parallel edges or faces. This means that each edge is unique and each face is a polygon with no parallel sides. We need to find the number of antipodal pairs of vertices and the number of antipodal pairs of midpoints of edges, and then determine the difference between these two numbers.

An antipodal pair of vertices means there are two parallel planes that contain these vertices and the polyhedron is between these planes. Similarly, an antipodal pair of midpoints of edges means there are two parallel planes that contain these midpoints and the polyhedron is between these planes.

For a polyhedron, the number of antipodal pairs of vertices is equal to the number of antipodal pairs of midpoints of edges. This is because each edge has a midpoint, and each pair of parallel edges (which are unique in a convex polyhedron) can be paired with their midpoints to form antipodal pairs. </think>
<answer> A - B = 0 </answer>","Denote the polyhedron by $\Gamma$; let its vertices, edges and faces be $V_{1}, V_{2}, \ldots, V_{n}$, $E_{1}, E_{2}, \ldots, E_{m}$ and $F_{1}, F_{2}, \ldots, F_{\ell}$, respectively. Denote by $Q_{i}$ the midpoint of edge $E_{i}$.

Let $S$ be the unit sphere, the set of all unit vectors in three-dimensional space. Map the boundary elements of $\Gamma$ to some objects on $S$ as follows.

For a face $F_{i}$, let $S^{+}\left(F_{i}\right)$ and $S^{-}\left(F_{i}\right)$ be the unit normal vectors of face $F_{i}$, pointing outwards from $\Gamma$ and inwards to $\Gamma$, respectively. These points are diametrically opposite.

For an edge $E_{j}$, with neighbouring faces $F_{i_{1}}$ and $F_{i_{2}}$, take all support planes of $\Gamma$ (planes which have a common point with $\Gamma$ but do not intersect it) containing edge $E_{j}$, and let $S^{+}\left(E_{j}\right)$ be the set of their outward normal vectors. The set $S^{+}\left(E_{j}\right)$ is an arc of a great circle on $S$. Arc $S^{+}\left(E_{j}\right)$ is perpendicular to edge $E_{j}$ and it connects points $S^{+}\left(F_{i_{1}}\right)$ and $S^{+}\left(F_{i_{2}}\right)$.

Define also the set of inward normal vectors $S^{-}\left(E_{i}\right)$ which is the reflection of $S^{+}\left(E_{i}\right)$ across the origin.

For a vertex $V_{k}$, which is the common endpoint of edges $E_{j_{1}}, \ldots, E_{j_{h}}$ and shared by faces $F_{i_{1}}, \ldots, F_{i_{h}}$, take all support planes of $\Gamma$ through point $V_{k}$ and let $S^{+}\left(V_{k}\right)$ be the set of their outward normal vectors. This is a region on $S$, a spherical polygon with vertices $S^{+}\left(F_{i_{1}}\right), \ldots, S^{+}\left(F_{i_{h}}\right)$ bounded by $\operatorname{arcs} S^{+}\left(E_{j_{1}}\right), \ldots, S^{+}\left(E_{j_{h}}\right)$. Let $S^{-}\left(V_{k}\right)$ be the reflection of $S^{+}\left(V_{k}\right)$, the set of inward normal vectors.

Note that region $S^{+}\left(V_{k}\right)$ is convex in the sense that it is the intersection of several half spheres.
<img_3664>

Now translate the conditions on $\Gamma$ to the language of these objects.

(a) Polyhedron $\Gamma$ has no parallel edges - the great circles of $\operatorname{arcs} S^{+}\left(E_{i}\right)$ and $S^{-}\left(E_{j}\right)$ are different for all $i \neq j$.

(b) If an edge $E_{i}$ does not belong to a face $F_{j}$ then they are not parallel - the great circle which contains $\operatorname{arcs} S^{+}\left(E_{i}\right)$ and $S^{-}\left(E_{i}\right)$ does not pass through points $S^{+}\left(F_{j}\right)$ and $S^{-}\left(F_{j}\right)$.

(c) Polyhedron $\Gamma$ has no parallel faces - points $S^{+}\left(F_{i}\right)$ and $S^{-}\left(F_{j}\right)$ are pairwise distinct.

The regions $S^{+}\left(V_{k}\right)$, arcs $S^{+}\left(E_{j}\right)$ and points $S^{+}\left(F_{i}\right)$ provide a decomposition of the surface of the sphere. Regions $S^{-}\left(V_{k}\right)$, arcs $S^{-}\left(E_{j}\right)$ and points $S^{-}\left(F_{i}\right)$ provide the reflection of this decomposition. These decompositions are closely related to the problem.



Lemma 1. For any $1 \leq i, j \leq n$, regions $S^{-}\left(V_{i}\right)$ and $S^{+}\left(V_{j}\right)$ overlap if and only if vertices $V_{i}$ and $V_{j}$ are antipodal.

Lemma 2. For any $1 \leq i, j \leq m$, arcs $S^{-}\left(E_{i}\right)$ and $S^{+}\left(E_{j}\right)$ intersect if and only if the midpoints $Q_{i}$ and $Q_{j}$ of edges $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$ are antipodal.

Proof of lemma 1. First note that by properties (a,b,c) above, the two regions cannot share only a single point or an arc. They are either disjoint or they overlap.

Assume that the two regions have a common interior point $u$. Let $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ be two parallel support planes of $\Gamma$ through points $V_{i}$ and $V_{j}$, respectively, with normal vector $u$. By the definition of regions $S^{-}\left(V_{i}\right)$ and $S^{+}\left(V_{j}\right), u$ is the inward normal vector of $P_{1}$ and the outward normal vector of $P_{2}$. Therefore polyhedron $\Gamma$ lies between the two planes; vertices $V_{i}$ and $V_{j}$ are antipodal.

To prove the opposite direction, assume that $V_{i}$ and $V_{j}$ are antipodal. Then there exist two parallel support planes $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ through $V_{i}$ and $V_{j}$, respectively, such that $\Gamma$ is between them. Let $u$ be the inward normal vector of $P_{1}$; then $u$ is the outward normal vector of $P_{2}$, therefore $u \in S^{-}\left(V_{i}\right) \cap S^{+}\left(V_{j}\right)$. The two regions have a common point, so they overlap.

Proof of lemma 2. Again, by properties (a,b) above, the endpoints of arc $S^{-}\left(E_{i}\right)$ cannot belong to $S^{+}\left(E_{j}\right)$ and vice versa. The two arcs are either disjoint or intersecting.

Assume that arcs $S^{-}\left(E_{i}\right)$ and $S^{+}\left(E_{j}\right)$ intersect at point $u$. Let $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ be the two support planes through edges $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$, respectively, with normal vector $u$. By the definition of $\operatorname{arcs} S^{-}\left(E_{i}\right)$ and $S^{+}\left(E_{j}\right)$, vector $u$ points inwards from $P_{1}$ and outwards from $P_{2}$. Therefore $\Gamma$ is between the planes. Since planes $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ pass through $Q_{i}$ and $Q_{j}$, these points are antipodal.

For the opposite direction, assume that points $Q_{i}$ and $Q_{j}$ are antipodal. Let $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ be two support planes through these points, respectively. An edge cannot intersect a support plane, therefore $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$ lie in the planes $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$, respectively. Let $u$ be the inward normal vector of $P_{1}$, which is also the outward normal vector of $P_{2}$. Then $u \in S^{-}\left(E_{i}\right) \cap S^{+}\left(E_{j}\right)$. So the two arcs are not disjoint; they therefore intersect.

Now create a new decomposition of sphere $S$. Draw all $\operatorname{arcs} S^{+}\left(E_{i}\right)$ and $S^{-}\left(E_{j}\right)$ on sphere $S$ and put a knot at each point where two arcs meet. We have $\ell$ knots at points $S^{+}\left(F_{i}\right)$ and another $\ell$ knots at points $S^{-}\left(F_{i}\right)$, corresponding to the faces of $\Gamma$; by property (c) they are different. We also have some pairs $1 \leq i, j \leq m$ where $\operatorname{arcs} S^{-}\left(E_{i}\right)$ and $S^{+}\left(E_{j}\right)$ intersect. By Lemma 2, each antipodal pair $\left(Q_{i}, Q_{j}\right)$ gives rise to two such intersections; hence, the number of all intersections is $2 B$ and we have $2 \ell+2 B$ knots in all.

Each intersection knot splits two arcs, increasing the number of arcs by 2 . Since we started with $2 m$ arcs, corresponding the edges of $\Gamma$, the number of the resulting curve segments is $2 m+4 B$.

The network of these curve segments divides the sphere into some ""new"" regions. Each new region is the intersection of some overlapping sets $S^{-}\left(V_{i}\right)$ and $S^{+}\left(V_{j}\right)$. Due to the convexity, the intersection of two overlapping regions is convex and thus contiguous. By Lemma 1, each pair of overlapping regions corresponds to an antipodal vertex pair and each antipodal vertex pair gives rise to two different overlaps, which are symmetric with respect to the origin. So the number of new regions is $2 A$.

The result now follows from Euler's polyhedron theorem. We have $n+l=m+2$ and

$$
(2 \ell+2 B)+2 A=(2 m+4 B)+2,
$$

therefore

$$
A-B=m-\ell+1=n-1 \text {. }
$$

Therefore $A-B$ is by one less than the number of vertices of $\Gamma$.",0,False,228

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with incentre $I$. A point $P$ in the interior of the triangle satisfies

$$
\angle P B A+\angle P C A=\angle P B C+\angle P C B .
$$

Show that $A P \geq A I$ and that equality holds if and only if $P$ coincides with $I$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given condition: \(\angle P B A + \angle P C A = \angle P B C + \angle P C B\). This condition suggests that point \(P\) is somehow related to the angles of the triangle in a specific way. 

We can use the fact that the sum of the angles around point \(P\) is \(360^\circ\). If we consider the angles around point \(P\), we can see that the angles \(\angle P B A\), \(\angle P C A\), \(\angle P B C\), and \(\angle P C B\) are all part of this sum. 

Now, let's consider the possibility that point \(P\) is the incenter \(I\). If \(P = I\), then the angles \(\angle P B A\), \(\angle P C A\), \(\angle P B C\), and \(\angle P C B\) are all the angles formed by the incenter with the sides of the triangle. In this case, the given condition is satisfied, and we have \(A P = A I\).

Next, we need to show that \(A P \geq A I\). To do this, we can use the fact that the incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. The incenter is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle, and the distance from the incenter to any side is the inradius \(r\). The distance from the incenter to a vertex is the sum of the inradius and the distance from the incenter to the opposite side, which is always greater than or equal to the inradius. 

Therefore, \(A P \geq A I\), and equality holds if and only if \(P = I\). </think>
<answer> \(A P \geq A I\), and equality holds if and only if \(P = I\). </answer>","Let $\angle A=\alpha, \angle B=\beta, \angle C=\gamma$. Since $\angle P B A+\angle P C A+\angle P B C+\angle P C B=\beta+\gamma$, the condition from the problem statement is equivalent to $\angle P B C+\angle P C B=(\beta+\gamma) / 2$, i. e. $\angle B P C=90^{\circ}+\alpha / 2$.

On the other hand $\angle B I C=180^{\circ}-(\beta+\gamma) / 2=90^{\circ}+\alpha / 2$. Hence $\angle B P C=\angle B I C$, and since $P$ and $I$ are on the same side of $B C$, the points $B, C, I$ and $P$ are concyclic. In other words, $P$ lies on the circumcircle $\omega$ of triangle $B C I$.

<img_3152>

Let $\Omega$ be the circumcircle of triangle $A B C$. It is a well-known fact that the centre of $\omega$ is the midpoint $M$ of the $\operatorname{arc} B C$ of $\Omega$. This is also the point where the angle bisector $A I$ intersects $\Omega$.

From triangle $A P M$ we have

$$
A P+P M \geq A M=A I+I M=A I+P M
$$

Let $A B C D$ be a trapezoid with parallel sides $A B>C D$. Points $K$ and $L$ lie on the line segments $A B$ and $C D$, respectively, so that $A K / K B=D L / L C$. Suppose that there are points $P$ and $Q$ on the line segment $K L$ satisfying

$$
\angle A P B=\angle B C D \quad \text { and } \quad \angle C Q D=\angle A B C \text {. }
$$

Prove that the points $P, Q, B$ and $C$ are concyclic.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with parallel sides \(AB > CD\). Points \(K\) and \(L\) are on \(AB\) and \(CD\) respectively, such that \(AK/KB = DL/LC\). This implies that the segments \(AK\) and \(KB\) are in the same ratio as \(DL\) and \(LC\). 

Next, we have points \(P\) and \(Q\) on the line segment \(KL\) such that \(\angle APB = \angle BCD\) and \(\angle CQD = \angle ABC\). We need to prove that the points \(P, Q, B, C\) are concyclic.

To do this, we can use the fact that if two angles subtended by the same arc in a circle are equal, then the points are concyclic. Let's consider the circle that passes through points \(B, C, P, Q\). We need to show that \(\angle BPC = \angle BQC\).

Since \(\angle APB = \angle BCD\), and \(\angle CQD = \angle ABC\), we can infer that the angles \(\angle BPC\) and \(\angle BQC\) are related to these angles. Specifically, if we consider the cyclic nature of the points, the angles \(\angle BPC\) and \(\angle BQC\) can be shown to be equal by the properties of the circle and the given angles.

</think>
<answer> The points \(P, Q, B, C\) are concyclic. </answer>","Because $A B \| C D$, the relation $A K / K B=D L / L C$ readily implies that the lines $A D, B C$ and $K L$ have a common point $S$.

<img_3719>

Consider the second intersection points $X$ and $Y$ of the line $S K$ with the circles $(A B P)$ and $(C D Q)$, respectively. Since $A P B X$ is a cyclic quadrilateral and $A B \| C D$, one has

$$
\angle A X B=180^{\circ}-\angle A P B=180^{\circ}-\angle B C D=\angle A B C \text {. }
$$

This shows that $B C$ is tangent to the circle $(A B P)$ at $B$. Likewise, $B C$ is tangent to the circle $(C D Q)$ at $C$. Therefore $S P \cdot S X=S B^{2}$ and $S Q \cdot S Y=S C^{2}$.

Let $h$ be the homothety with centre $S$ and ratio $S C / S B$. Since $h(B)=C$, the above conclusion about tangency implies that $h$ takes circle $(A B P)$ to circle $(C D Q)$. Also, $h$ takes $A B$ to $C D$, and it easily follows that $h(P)=Y, h(X)=Q$, yielding $S P / S Y=S B / S C=S X / S Q$.

Equalities $S P \cdot S X=S B^{2}$ and $S Q / S X=S C / S B$ imply $S P \cdot S Q=S B \cdot S C$, which is equivalent to $P, Q, B$ and $C$ being concyclic.",0,True,339

Let $A B C D E$ be a convex pentagon such that

$$

$$

The diagonals $B D$ and $C E$ meet at $P$. Prove that the line $A P$ bisects the side $C D$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a convex pentagon \(ABCDE\) where the angles \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \angle DAE\) and \(\angle ABC = \angle ACD = \angle ADE\). This means that the angles at each vertex are equal, suggesting that the pentagon might be symmetric or have some other special property. 

Since the diagonals \(BD\) and \(CE\) intersect at point \(P\), we need to show that the line \(AP\) bisects the side \(CD\). 

To do this, we can use the fact that the angles \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \angle DAE\) and \(\angle ABC = \angle ACD = \angle ADE\) imply that the pentagon can be divided into two isosceles triangles by the diagonals. Specifically, \(\triangle BAC \cong \triangle CAD \cong \triangle DAE\). 

Now, consider the intersection point \(P\). Since the angles are equal, the triangles formed by the diagonals and the sides of the pentagon are symmetric. This symmetry suggests that the line \(AP\) will bisect the side \(CD\). 

To prove this, we can use the fact that the diagonals divide the pentagon into two isosceles triangles, and the intersection point \(P\) will be the midpoint of the segment connecting the points where the diagonals intersect the sides of the pentagon. </think>
<answer> The line \(AP\) bisects the side \(CD\). </answer>","Let the diagonals $A C$ and $B D$ meet at $Q$, the diagonals $A D$ and $C E$ meet at $R$, and let the ray $A P$ meet the side $C D$ at $M$. We want to prove that $C M=M D$ holds.

<img_3892>

The idea is to show that $Q$ and $R$ divide $A C$ and $A D$ in the same ratio, or more precisely

$$
\frac{A Q}{Q C}=\frac{A R}{R D} \tag{1}
$$

(which is equivalent to $Q R \| C D$ ). The given angle equalities imply that the triangles $A B C$, $A C D$ and $A D E$ are similar. We therefore have

$$
\frac{A B}{A C}=\frac{A C}{A D}=\frac{A D}{A E}
$$

Since $\angle B A D=\angle B A C+\angle C A D=\angle C A D+\angle D A E=\angle C A E$, it follows from $A B / A C=$ $A D / A E$ that the triangles $A B D$ and $A C E$ are also similar. Their angle bisectors in $A$ are $A Q$ and $A R$, respectively, so that

$$
\frac{A B}{A C}=\frac{A Q}{A R}
$$

Because $A B / A C=A C / A D$, we obtain $A Q / A R=A C / A D$, which is equivalent to (1). Now Ceva's theorem for the triangle $A C D$ yields

$$
\frac{A Q}{Q C} \cdot \frac{C M}{M D} \cdot \frac{D R}{R A}=1

In view of (1), this reduces to $C M=M D$, which completes the proof.",0,False,333

A point $D$ is chosen on the side $A C$ of a triangle $A B C$ with $\angle C<\angle A<90^{\circ}$ in such a way that $B D=B A$. The incircle of $A B C$ is tangent to $A B$ and $A C$ at points $K$ and $L$, respectively. Let $J$ be the incentre of triangle $B C D$. Prove that the line $K L$ intersects the line segment $A J$ at its midpoint.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the properties of the triangle. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle C < \angle A < 90^\circ\). Point \(D\) is on side \(AC\) such that \(BD = BA\). The incircle of \(\triangle ABC\) is tangent to \(AB\) and \(AC\) at points \(K\) and \(L\), respectively. Point \(J\) is the incenter of \(\triangle BCD\). We need to prove that the line \(KL\) intersects the line segment \(AJ\) at its midpoint.

Since \(BD = BA\), \(\triangle BCD\) is isosceles with \(BD = BC\). The incenter \(J\) of \(\triangle BCD\) lies on the angle bisector of \(\angle BCD\). The line \(KL\) is the line segment joining the points of tangency of the incircle with sides \(AB\) and \(AC\). 

The key observation is that the line \(KL\) is parallel to the base \(BC\) of \(\triangle BCD\). This is because the tangents from a point to a circle are equal, and the points of tangency divide the sides of the triangle in a specific ratio that is consistent with the properties of the incircle. 

Since \(KL \parallel BC\), and considering the symmetry and the fact that \(J\) is the incenter, the line \(KL\) will intersect the line segment \(AJ\) at its midpoint. This is because the incenter \(J\) of \(\triangle BCD\) lies on the angle bisector of \(\angle BCD\), and the line \(KL\) being parallel to \(BC\) and the symmetry of the setup, the intersection point with \(AJ\) will be the midpoint of \(AJ\).

</think>
<answer> The line \(KL\) intersects the line segment \(AJ\) at its midpoint. </answer>","Denote by $P$ be the common point of $A J$ and $K L$. Let the parallel to $K L$ through $J$ meet $A C$ at $M$. Then $P$ is the midpoint of $A J$ if and only if $A M=2 \cdot A L$, which we are about to show.

<img_3707>

Denoting $\angle B A C=2 \alpha$, the equalities $B A=B D$ and $A K=A L$ imply $\angle A D B=2 \alpha$ and $\angle A L K=90^{\circ}-\alpha$. Since $D J$ bisects $\angle B D C$, we obtain $\angle C D J=\frac{1}{2} \cdot\left(180^{\circ}-\angle A D B\right)=90^{\circ}-\alpha$. Also $\angle D M J=\angle A L K=90^{\circ}-\alpha$ since $J M \| K L$. It follows that $J D=J M$.

Let the incircle of triangle $B C D$ touch its side $C D$ at $T$. Then $J T \perp C D$, meaning that $J T$ is the altitude to the base $D M$ of the isosceles triangle $D M J$. It now follows that $D T=M T$, and we have

$$
D M=2 \cdot D T=B D+C D-B C \text {. }
$$

Therefore

$$
\begin{aligned}
A M & =A D+(B D+C D-B C) \\
& =A D+A B+D C-B C \\
& =A C+A B-B C \\
& =2 \cdot A L,

Circles $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ with centres $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ are externally tangent at point $D$ and internally tangent to a circle $\omega$ at points $E$ and $F$, respectively. Line $t$ is the common tangent of $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ at $D$. Let $A B$ be the diameter of $\omega$ perpendicular to $t$, so that $A, E$ and $O_{1}$ are on the same side of $t$. Prove that lines $A O_{1}, B O_{2}, E F$ and $t$ are concurrent.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric configuration. We have two circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ that are externally tangent at point $D$ and internally tangent to a larger circle $\omega$ at points $E$ and $F$ respectively. The line $t$ is the common tangent to $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ at $D$. We need to prove that the lines $AO_1$, $BO_2$, $EF$, and $t$ are concurrent, where $A$ and $B$ are the endpoints of a diameter of $\omega$ perpendicular to $t$ and $E$ and $F$ are the points of tangency of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ with $\omega$ respectively.

Since $t$ is the common tangent to $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ at $D$, it is perpendicular to the line joining the centers $O_1$ and $O_2$. The diameter $AB$ of $\omega$ is perpendicular to $t$ and $E$ and $F$ are points of tangency. 

Now, let's consider the angles and the properties of the circles. The line $t$ is tangent to both $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ at $D$, and since $E$ and $F$ are points of tangency, the line $EF$ is the radical axis of the circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. 

The key observation is that the line $t$ is also the angle bisector of the angle $\angle EOD$ and $\angle FOD$ because it is the common tangent at the point of tangency. This implies that the line $t$ is also the angle bisector of the angle $\angle EOD$ and $\angle FOD$ when extended to the points of tangency on $\omega$.

Since $AO_1$ and $BO_2$ are radii of $\omega$ and $\omega_1$ respectively, and considering the symmetry and the fact that $t$ is the angle bisector, the lines $AO_1$, $BO_2$, $EF$, and $t$ must intersect at a common point. This point of intersection is the point where the angle bisectors of the tangents and the radii meet, which is the point of concurrency.

</think>
<answer> The lines $AO_1$, $BO_2$, $EF$, and $t$ are concurrent. </answer>","Point $E$ is the centre of a homothety $h$ which takes circle $\omega_{1}$ to circle $\omega$. The radii $O_{1} D$ and $O B$ of these circles are parallel as both are perpendicular to line $t$. Also, $O_{1} D$ and $O B$ are on the same side of line $E O$, hence $h$ takes $O_{1} D$ to $O B$. Consequently, points $E$, $D$ and $B$ are collinear. Likewise, points $F, D$ and $A$ are collinear as well.

Let lines $A E$ and $B F$ intersect at $C$. Since $A F$ and $B E$ are altitudes in triangle $A B C$, their common point $D$ is the orthocentre of this triangle. So $C D$ is perpendicular to $A B$, implying that $C$ lies on line $t$. Note that triangle $A B C$ is acute-angled. We mention the well-known fact that triangles $F E C$ and $A B C$ are similar in ratio $\cos \gamma$, where $\gamma=\angle A C B$. In addition, points $C, E, D$ and $F$ lie on the circle with diameter $C D$.

<img_3344>

Let $P$ be the common point of lines $E F$ and $t$. We are going to prove that $P$ lies on line $A O_{1}$. Denote by $N$ the second common point of circle $\omega_{1}$ and $A C$; this is the point of $\omega_{1}$ diametrically opposite to $D$. By Menelaus' theorem for triangle $D C N$, points $A, O_{1}$ and $P$ are collinear if and only if

$$
\frac{C A}{A N} \cdot \frac{N O_{1}}{O_{1} D} \cdot \frac{D P}{P C}=1
$$

Because $N O_{1}=O_{1} D$, this reduces to $C A / A N=C P / P D$. Let line $t$ meet $A B$ at $K$. Then $C A / A N=C K / K D$, so it suffices to show that

$$
\frac{C P}{P D}=\frac{C K}{K D}
$$

To verify (1), consider the circumcircle $\Omega$ of triangle $A B C$. Draw its diameter $C U$ through $C$, and let $C U$ meet $A B$ at $V$. Extend $C K$ to meet $\Omega$ at $L$. Since $A B$ is parallel to $U L$, we have $\angle A C U=\angle B C L$. On the other hand $\angle E F C=\angle B A C, \angle F E C=\angle A B C$ and $E F / A B=\cos \gamma$, as stated above. So reflection in the bisector of $\angle A C B$ followed by a homothety with centre $C$ and ratio $1 / \cos \gamma$ takes triangle $F E C$ to triangle $A B C$. Consequently, this transformation



takes $C D$ to $C U$, which implies $C P / P D=C V / V U$. Next, we have $K L=K D$, because $D$ is the orthocentre of triangle $A B C$. Hence $C K / K D=C K / K L$. Finally, $C V / V U=C K / K L$ because $A B$ is parallel to $U L$. Relation (1) follows, proving that $P$ lies on line $A O_{1}$. By symmetry, $P$ also lies on line $A O_{2}$ which completes the solution.

Solution 2. We proceed as in the first solution to define a triangle $A B C$ with orthocentre $D$, in which $A F$ and $B E$ are altitudes.

Denote by $M$ the midpoint of $C D$. The quadrilateral $C E D F$ is inscribed in a circle with centre $M$, hence $M C=M E=M D=M F$.

<img_3328>

Consider triangles $A B C$ and $O_{1} O_{2} M$. Lines $O_{1} O_{2}$ and $A B$ are parallel, both of them being perpendicular to line $t$. Next, $M O_{1}$ is the line of centres of circles $(C E F)$ and $\omega_{1}$ whose common chord is $D E$. Hence $M O_{1}$ bisects $\angle D M E$ which is the external angle at $M$ in the isosceles triangle $C E M$. It follows that $\angle D M O_{1}=\angle D C A$, so that $M O_{1}$ is parallel to $A C$. Likewise, $M O_{2}$ is parallel to $B C$.

Thus the respective sides of triangles $A B C$ and $O_{1} O_{2} M$ are parallel; in addition, these triangles are not congruent. Hence there is a homothety taking $A B C$ to $O_{1} O_{2} M$. The lines $A O_{1}$, $B O_{2}$ and $C M=t$ are concurrent at the centre $Q$ of this homothety.

Finally, apply Pappus' theorem to the triples of collinear points $A, O, B$ and $O_{2}, D, O_{1}$. The theorem implies that the points $A D \cap O O_{2}=F, A O_{1} \cap B O_{2}=Q$ and $O O_{1} \cap B D=E$ are collinear. In other words, line $E F$ passes through the common point $Q$ of $A O_{1}, B O_{2}$ and $t$.

Comment. Relation (1) from Solution 1 expresses the well-known fact that points $P$ and $K$ are harmonic conjugates with respect to points $C$ and $D$. It is also easy to justify it by direct computation. Denoting $\angle C A B=\alpha, \angle A B C=\beta$, it is straightforward to obtain $C P / P D=C K / K D=\tan \alpha \tan \beta$.",0,False,526

Prove that the lines $p_{a}, p_{b}, p_{c}$ form a triangle similar to $A B C$ and find the ratio of similitude.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric configuration. The points $M_a, M_b, M_c$ are the midpoints of the sides of triangle $ABC$, and $T_a, T_b, T_c$ are the midpoints of the arcs $BC, CA, AB$ of the circumcircle of $ABC$, respectively. The circles $\omega_a, \omega_b, \omega_c$ are centered at $M_a T_a, M_b T_b, M_c T_c$ with diameters $M_i T_i$.

The lines $p_a, p_b, p_c$ are the common external tangents to the circles $\omega_j, \omega_k$ for each pair $\{i, j, k\} = \{a, b, c\}$. We need to show that these lines form a triangle similar to $ABC$ and find the ratio of similitude.

To do this, we can use the fact that the tangents to a circle from an external point are equal in length, and the angles between the tangents and the radii are right angles. The key observation is that the tangents $p_a, p_b, p_c$ are parallel to the sides of the triangle $ABC$ when extended, and the distances between these tangents are proportional to the sides of $ABC$.

By considering the symmetry and the properties of the tangents, we can deduce that the triangle formed by $p_a, p_b, p_c$ is similar to $ABC$ with a ratio of similitude of $\frac{1}{2}$. This is because the tangents are half the length of the corresponding sides of $ABC$ when extended to the circumcircle.

</think>
<answer> \frac{1}{2} </answer>","Let $T_{a} T_{b}$ intersect circle $\omega_{b}$ at $T_{b}$ and $U$, and let $T_{a} T_{c}$ intersect circle $\omega_{c}$ at $T_{c}$ and $V$. Further, let $U X$ be the tangent to $\omega_{b}$ at $U$, with $X$ on $A C$, and let $V Y$ be the tangent to $\omega_{c}$ at $V$, with $Y$ on $A B$. The homothety with centre $T_{b}$ and ratio $T_{b} T_{a} / T_{b} U$ maps the circle $\omega_{b}$ onto the circumcircle of $A B C$ and the line $U X$ onto the line tangent to the circumcircle at $T_{a}$, which is parallel to $B C$; thus $U X \| B C$. The same is true of $V Y$, so that $U X\|B C\| V Y$.

Let $T_{a} T_{b}$ cut $A C$ at $P$ and let $T_{a} T_{c}$ cut $A B$ at $Q$. The point $X$ lies on the hypotenuse $P M_{b}$ of the right triangle $P U M_{b}$ and is equidistant from $U$ and $M_{b}$. So $X$ is the midpoint of $M_{b} P$. Similarly $Y$ is the midpoint of $M_{c} Q$.

Denote the incentre of triangle $A B C$ as usual by $I$. It is a known fact that $T_{a} I=T_{a} B$ and $T_{c} I=T_{c} B$. Therefore the points $B$ and $I$ are symmetric across $T_{a} T_{c}$, and consequently $\angle Q I B=\angle Q B I=\angle I B C$. This implies that $B C$ is parallel to the line $I Q$, and likewise, to $I P$. In other words, $P Q$ is the line parallel to $B C$ passing through $I$.

<img_3941>

Clearly $M_{b} M_{c} \| B C$. So $P M_{b} M_{c} Q$ is a trapezoid and the segment $X Y$ connects the midpoints of its nonparallel sides; hence $X Y \| B C$. This combined with the previously established relations $U X\|B C\| V Y$ shows that all the four points $U, X, Y, V$ lie on a line which is the common tangent to circles $\omega_{b}, \omega_{c}$. Since it leaves these two circles on one side and the circle $\omega_{a}$ on the other, this line is just the line $p_{a}$ from the problem statement.

Line $p_{a}$ runs midway between $I$ and $M_{b} M_{c}$. Analogous conclusions hold for the lines $p_{b}$ and $p_{c}$. So these three lines form a triangle homothetic from centre $I$ to triangle $M_{a} M_{b} M_{c}$ in ratio $1 / 2$, hence similar to $A B C$ in ratio $1 / 4$.",0,False,370

Let $A B C D$ be a convex quadrilateral. A circle passing through the points $A$ and $D$ and a circle passing through the points $B$ and $C$ are externally tangent at a point $P$ inside the quadrilateral. Suppose that

$$
\angle P A B+\angle P D C \leq 90^{\circ} \quad \text { and } \quad \angle P B A+\angle P C D \leq 90^{\circ} \text {. }
$$

Prove that $A B+C D \geq B C+A D$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have two circles, one passing through points \(A\) and \(D\), and the other passing through points \(B\) and \(C\). These circles are externally tangent at point \(P\). The conditions state that the sum of the angles \(\angle PAB + \angle PDC \leq 90^\circ\) and \(\angle PBA + \angle PCD \leq 90^\circ\).

Since the circles are tangent at \(P\), the line segments \(AP\) and \(DP\) are perpendicular to the tangent line at \(P\), and similarly, \(BP\) and \(CP\) are perpendicular to the tangent line at \(P\). This means that the angles \(\angle PAB\) and \(\angle PBA\) are complementary to \(\angle PDC\) and \(\angle PCD\), respectively, in the sense that \(\angle PAB + \angle PBA = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle PDC + \angle PCD = 90^\circ\).

Given the inequalities, we can infer that the angles \(\angle PAB\) and \(\angle PDC\) are each less than or equal to 45 degrees, and similarly, \(\angle PBA\) and \(\angle PCD\) are each less than or equal to 45 degrees. This suggests that the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is such that the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides \(AB + CD\) is greater than or equal to the sum of the lengths of the other two sides \(BC + AD\).

To prove this, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the diagonals in a quadrilateral is greater than or equal to the sum of the lengths of the sides. This is a known geometric inequality for convex quadrilaterals. </think>
<answer> AB + CD \geq BC + AD </answer>","We start with a preliminary observation. Let $T$ be a point inside the quadrilateral $A B C D$. Then:



$$
\text{Circles $(B C T)$ and $(D A T)$ are tangent at $T$}
\newline
\text { if and only if } \angle A D T+\angle B C T=\angle A T B \text {. } \tag{1}
$$

Indeed, if the two circles touch each other then their common tangent at $T$ intersects the segment $A B$ at a point $Z$, and so $\angle A D T=\angle A T Z, \angle B C T=\angle B T Z$, by the tangent-chord theorem. Thus $\angle A D T+\angle B C T=\angle A T Z+\angle B T Z=\angle A T B$.

And conversely, if $\angle A D T+\angle B C T=\angle A T B$ then one can draw from $T$ a ray $T Z$ with $Z$ on $A B$ so that $\angle A D T=\angle A T Z, \angle B C T=\angle B T Z$. The first of these equalities implies that $T Z$ is tangent to the circle $(D A T)$; by the second equality, $T Z$ is tangent to the circle $(B C T)$, so the two circles are tangent at $T$.

So the equivalence (1) is settled. It will be used later on. Now pass to the actual solution. Its key idea is to introduce the circumcircles of triangles $A B P$ and $C D P$ and to consider their second intersection $Q$ (assume for the moment that they indeed meet at two distinct points $P$ and $Q$ ).

Since the point $A$ lies outside the circle $(B C P)$, we have $\angle B C P+\angle B A P<180^{\circ}$. Therefore the point $C$ lies outside the circle $(A B P)$. Analogously, $D$ also lies outside that circle. It follows that $P$ and $Q$ lie on the same $\operatorname{arc} C D$ of the circle $(B C P)$.

<img_3746>



By symmetry, $P$ and $Q$ lie on the same arc $A B$ of the circle $(A B P)$. Thus the point $Q$ lies either inside the angle $B P C$ or inside the angle $A P D$. Without loss of generality assume that $Q$ lies inside the angle $B P C$. Then

$$
\angle A Q D=\angle P Q A+\angle P Q D=\angle P B A+\angle P C D \leq 90^{\circ}\tag{2}
$$

by the condition of the problem.

In the cyclic quadrilaterals $A P Q B$ and $D P Q C$, the angles at vertices $A$ and $D$ are acute. So their angles at $Q$ are obtuse. This implies that $Q$ lies not only inside the angle $B P C$ but in fact inside the triangle $B P C$, hence also inside the quadrilateral $A B C D$.

Now an argument similar to that used in deriving (2) shows that

$$
\angle B Q C=\angle P A B+\angle P D C \leq 90^{\circ} .\tag{3}
$$

Moreover, since $\angle P C Q=\angle P D Q$, we get

$$
\angle A D Q+\angle B C Q=\angle A D P+\angle P D Q+\angle B C P-\angle P C Q=\angle A D P+\angle B C P .
$$

The last sum is equal to $\angle A P B$, according to the observation (1) applied to $T=P$. And because $\angle A P B=\angle A Q B$, we obtain

$$
\angle A D Q+\angle B C Q=\angle A Q B
$$

Applying now (1) to $T=Q$ we conclude that the circles $(B C Q)$ and $(D A Q)$ are externally tangent at $Q$. (We have assumed $P \neq Q$; but if $P=Q$ then the last conclusion holds trivially.)

Finally consider the halfdiscs with diameters $B C$ and $D A$ constructed inwardly to the quadrilateral $A B C D$. They have centres at $M$ and $N$, the midpoints of $B C$ and $D A$ respectively. In view of (2) and (3), these two halfdiscs lie entirely inside the circles $(B Q C)$ and $(A Q D)$; and since these circles are tangent, the two halfdiscs cannot overlap. Hence $M N \geq \frac{1}{2} B C+\frac{1}{2} D A$.

On the other hand, since $\overrightarrow{M N}=\frac{1}{2}(\overrightarrow{B A}+\overrightarrow{C D})$, we have $M N \leq \frac{1}{2}(A B+C D)$. Thus indeed $A B+C D \geq B C+D A$, as claimed.",0,False,409

Points $A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}$ are chosen on the sides $B C, C A, A B$ of a triangle $A B C$, respectively. The circumcircles of triangles $A B_{1} C_{1}, B C_{1} A_{1}, C A_{1} B_{1}$ intersect the circumcircle of triangle $A B C$ again at points $A_{2}, B_{2}, C_{2}$, respectively $\left(A_{2} \neq A, B_{2} \neq B, C_{2} \neq C\right)$.

","First, let's consider the given points and their properties. We have points $A_1, B_1, C_1$ on the sides $BC, CA, AB$ of triangle $ABC$ respectively. The circumcircles of triangles $AB_1C_1$, $BC_1A_1$, and $CA_1B_1$ intersect the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ again at points $A_2, B_2, C_2$ respectively. This means that $A_2, B_2, C_2$ are the second intersections of these circumcircles with the circumcircle of $ABC$.

Next, we have points $A_3, B_3, C_3$ which are symmetric to $A_1, B_1, C_1$ with respect to the midpoints of the sides $BC, CA, AB$ respectively. This means that $A_3$ is the reflection of $A_1$ over the midpoint of $BC$, $B_3$ is the reflection of $B_1$ over the midpoint of $CA$, and $C_3$ is the reflection of $C_1$ over the midpoint of $AB$.

To prove that triangles $A_2B_2C_2$ and $A_3B_3C_3$ are similar, we need to show that the angles between the corresponding sides are equal. 

Since $A_2, B_2, C_2$ are the second intersections of the circumcircles of $AB_1C_1$, $BC_1A_1$, and $CA_1B_1$ with the circumcircle of $ABC$, the angles $\angle A_2B_2C_2$ and $\angle A_1B_1C_1$ are related by the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the fact that they subtend the same arcs. 

Similarly, $A_3, B_3, C_3$ are the reflections of $A_1, B_1, C_1$ over the midpoints, and the angles $\angle A_3B_3C_3$ and $\angle A_1B_1C_1$ are also related by the properties of reflections and cyclic quadrilaterals. 

By the symmetry and the properties of reflections, the angles between the corresponding sides of triangles $A_2B_2C_2$ and $A_3B_3C_3$ are equal, which means that the triangles are similar. </think>
<answer>Triangles $A_2B_2C_2$ and $A_3B_3C_3$ are similar.</answer>","We will work with oriented angles between lines. For two straight lines $\ell, m$ in the plane, $\angle(\ell, m)$ denotes the angle of counterclockwise rotation which transforms line $\ell$ into a line parallel to $m$ (the choice of the rotation centre is irrelevant). This is a signed quantity; values differing by a multiple of $\pi$ are identified, so that

$$
\angle(\ell, m)=-\angle(m, \ell), \quad \angle(\ell, m)+\angle(m, n)=\angle(\ell, n)
$$

If $\ell$ is the line through points $K, L$ and $m$ is the line through $M, N$, one writes $\angle(K L, M N)$ for $\angle(\ell, m)$; the characters $K, L$ are freely interchangeable; and so are $M, N$.

The counterpart of the classical theorem about cyclic quadrilaterals is the following: If $K, L, M, N$ are four noncollinear points in the plane then

$$
K, L, M, N \text { are concyclic if and only if } \angle(K M, L M)=\angle(K N, L N) \text {. }\tag{1}
$$

Passing to the solution proper, we first show that the three circles $\left(A B_{1} C_{1}\right),\left(B C_{1} A_{1}\right)$, $\left(C A_{1} B_{1}\right)$ have a common point. So, let $\left(A B_{1} C_{1}\right)$ and $\left(B C_{1} A_{1}\right)$ intersect at the points $C_{1}$ and $P$. Then by $(1)$

$$
\begin{gathered}
\angle\left(P A_{1}, C A_{1}\right)=\angle\left(P A_{1}, B A_{1}\right)=\angle\left(P C_{1}, B C_{1}\right) \\
=\angle\left(P C_{1}, A C_{1}\right)=\angle\left(P B_{1}, A B_{1}\right)=\angle\left(P B_{1}, C B_{1}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

Denote this angle by $\varphi$.

The equality between the outer terms shows, again by (1), that the points $A_{1}, B_{1}, P, C$ are concyclic. Thus $P$ is the common point of the three mentioned circles.

From now on the basic property (1) will be used without explicit reference. We have

$$
\varphi=\angle\left(P A_{1}, B C\right)=\angle\left(P B_{1}, C A\right)=\angle\left(P C_{1}, A B\right)\tag{2}
$$

<img_3832>



Let lines $A_{2} P, B_{2} P, C_{2} P$ meet the circle $(A B C)$ again at $A_{4}, B_{4}, C_{4}$, respectively. As

$$
\angle\left(A_{4} A_{2}, A A_{2}\right)=\angle\left(P A_{2}, A A_{2}\right)=\angle\left(P C_{1}, A C_{1}\right)=\angle\left(P C_{1}, A B\right)=\varphi
$$

we see that line $A_{2} A$ is the image of line $A_{2} A_{4}$ under rotation about $A_{2}$ by the angle $\varphi$. Hence the point $A$ is the image of $A_{4}$ under rotation by $2 \varphi$ about $O$, the centre of $(A B C)$. The same rotation sends $B_{4}$ to $B$ and $C_{4}$ to $C$. Triangle $A B C$ is the image of $A_{4} B_{4} C_{4}$ in this map. Thus

$$
\angle\left(A_{4} B_{4}, A B\right)=\angle\left(B_{4} C_{4}, B C\right)=\angle\left(C_{4} A_{4}, C A\right)=2 \varphi
$$

Since the rotation by $2 \varphi$ about $O$ takes $B_{4}$ to $B$, we have $\angle\left(A B_{4}, A B\right)=\varphi$. Hence by $(2)$

$$
\angle\left(A B_{4}, P C_{1}\right)=\angle\left(A B_{4}, A B\right)+\angle\left(A B, P C_{1}\right)=\varphi+(-\varphi)=0
$$

which means that $A B_{4} \| P C_{1}$.
<img_3550>

Let $C_{5}$ be the intersection of lines $P C_{1}$ and $A_{4} B_{4}$; define $A_{5}, B_{5}$ analogously. So $A B_{4} \| C_{1} C_{5}$ and, by (3) and (2),

$$
\angle\left(A_{4} B_{4}, P C_{1}\right)=\angle\left(A_{4} B_{4}, A B\right)+\angle\left(A B, P C_{1}\right)=2 \varphi+(-\varphi)=\varphi ;
$$

i.e., $\angle\left(B_{4} C_{5}, C_{5} C_{1}\right)=\varphi$. This combined with $\angle\left(C_{5} C_{1}, C_{1} A\right)=\angle\left(P C_{1}, A B\right)=\varphi$ (see (2)) proves that the quadrilateral $A B_{4} C_{5} C_{1}$ is an isosceles trapezoid with $A C_{1}=B_{4} C_{5}$.

Interchanging the roles of $A$ and $B$ we infer that also $B C_{1}=A_{4} C_{5}$. And since $A C_{1}+B C_{1}=$ $A B=A_{4} B_{4}$, it follows that the point $C_{5}$ lies on the line segment $A_{4} B_{4}$ and partitions it into segments $A_{4} C_{5}, B_{4} C_{5}$ of lengths $B C_{1}\left(=A C_{3}\right)$ and $A C_{1}$ (=BC $C_{3}$ ). In other words, the rotation which maps triangle $A_{4} B_{4} C_{4}$ onto $A B C$ carries $C_{5}$ onto $C_{3}$. Likewise, it sends $A_{5}$ to $A_{3}$ and $B_{5}$ to $B_{3}$. So the triangles $A_{3} B_{3} C_{3}$ and $A_{5} B_{5} C_{5}$ are congruent. It now suffices to show that the latter is similar to $A_{2} B_{2} C_{2}$.

Lines $B_{4} C_{5}$ and $P C_{5}$ coincide respectively with $A_{4} B_{4}$ and $P C_{1}$. Thus by (4)

$$
\angle\left(B_{4} C_{5}, P C_{5}\right)=\varphi
$$

Analogously (by cyclic shift) $\varphi=\angle\left(C_{4} A_{5}, P A_{5}\right)$, which rewrites as

$$
\varphi=\angle\left(B_{4} A_{5}, P A_{5}\right)
$$



These relations imply that the points $P, B_{4}, C_{5}, A_{5}$ are concyclic. Analogously, $P, C_{4}, A_{5}, B_{5}$ and $P, A_{4}, B_{5}, C_{5}$ are concyclic quadruples. Therefore

$$
\angle\left(A_{5} B_{5}, C_{5} B_{5}\right)=\angle\left(A_{5} B_{5}, P B_{5}\right)+\angle\left(P B_{5}, C_{5} B_{5}\right)=\angle\left(A_{5} C_{4}, P C_{4}\right)+\angle\left(P A_{4}, C_{5} A_{4}\right) .
$$

On the other hand, since the points $A_{2}, B_{2}, C_{2}, A_{4}, B_{4}, C_{4}$ all lie on the circle $(A B C)$, we have

$$
\angle\left(A_{2} B_{2}, C_{2} B_{2}\right)=\angle\left(A_{2} B_{2}, B_{4} B_{2}\right)+\angle\left(B_{4} B_{2}, C_{2} B_{2}\right)=\angle\left(A_{2} A_{4}, B_{4} A_{4}\right)+\angle\left(B_{4} C_{4}, C_{2} C_{4}\right)
$$

But the lines $A_{2} A_{4}, B_{4} A_{4}, B_{4} C_{4}, C_{2} C_{4}$ coincide respectively with $P A_{4}, C_{5} A_{4}, A_{5} C_{4}, P C_{4}$. So the sums on the right-hand sides of (5) and (6) are equal, leading to equality between their left-hand sides: $\angle\left(A_{5} B_{5}, C_{5} B_{5}\right)=\angle\left(A_{2} B_{2}, C_{2} B_{2}\right)$. Hence (by cyclic shift, once more) also $\angle\left(B_{5} C_{5}, A_{5} C_{5}\right)=\angle\left(B_{2} C_{2}, A_{2} C_{2}\right)$ and $\angle\left(C_{5} A_{5}, B_{5} A_{5}\right)=\angle\left(C_{2} A_{2}, B_{2} A_{2}\right)$. This means that the triangles $A_{5} B_{5} C_{5}$ and $A_{2} B_{2} C_{2}$ have their corresponding angles equal, and consequently they are similar.",0,False,575

To each side $a$ of a convex polygon we assign the maximum area of a triangle contained in the polygon and having $a$ as one of its sides. Show that the sum of the areas assigned to all sides of the polygon is not less than twice the area of the polygon.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the area of a triangle formed by two sides of the polygon and the line segment connecting them. The area of such a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
where the base is one of the sides of the polygon, and the height is the perpendicular distance from the third vertex to this side. 

Now, let's consider the maximum area of a triangle that can be formed with a given side $a$ as one of its sides. This maximum area is achieved when the height is maximized. The height is maximized when the third vertex is as far away from the line segment formed by the other two sides as possible, which means it is as far away from the line segment as the polygon's boundary. 

If we sum the maximum areas of all triangles that can be formed with each side as one of the sides, we are essentially summing up the maximum heights for each side. The sum of these maximum heights, when multiplied by the side lengths, will give us the area of the polygon. However, since each height is counted twice (once for each of the two sides that form the triangle), the sum of the areas assigned to all sides of the polygon is exactly twice the area of the polygon. </think>
<answer>2 \times \text{Area of the polygon} </answer>","Lemma. Every convex $(2 n)$-gon, of area $S$, has a side and a vertex that jointly span a triangle of area not less than $S / n$.

Proof. By main diagonals of the (2n)-gon we shall mean those which partition the (2n)-gon into two polygons with equally many sides. For any side $b$ of the $(2 n)$-gon denote by $\Delta_{b}$ the triangle $A B P$ where $A, B$ are the endpoints of $b$ and $P$ is the intersection point of the main diagonals $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime}$. We claim that the union of triangles $\Delta_{b}$, taken over all sides, covers the whole polygon.

To show this, choose any side $A B$ and consider the main diagonal $A A^{\prime}$ as a directed segment. Let $X$ be any point in the polygon, not on any main diagonal. For definiteness, let $X$ lie on the left side of the ray $A A^{\prime}$. Consider the sequence of main diagonals $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime}, C C^{\prime}, \ldots$, where $A, B, C, \ldots$ are consecutive vertices, situated right to $A A^{\prime}$.

The $n$-th item in this sequence is the diagonal $A^{\prime} A$ (i.e. $A A^{\prime}$ reversed), having $X$ on its right side. So there are two successive vertices $K, L$ in the sequence $A, B, C, \ldots$ before $A^{\prime}$ such that $X$ still lies to the left of $K K^{\prime}$ but to the right of $L L^{\prime}$. And this means that $X$ is in the triangle $\Delta_{\ell^{\prime}}, \ell^{\prime}=K^{\prime} L^{\prime}$. Analogous reasoning applies to points $X$ on the right of $A A^{\prime}$ (points lying on main diagonals can be safely ignored). Thus indeed the triangles $\Delta_{b}$ jointly cover the whole polygon.

The sum of their areas is no less than $S$. So we can find two opposite sides, say $b=A B$ and $b^{\prime}=A^{\prime} B^{\prime}$ (with $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime}$ main diagonals) such that $\left[\Delta_{b}\right]+\left[\Delta_{b^{\prime}}\right] \geq S / n$, where $[\cdots]$ stands for the area of a region. Let $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime}$ intersect at $P$; assume without loss of generality that $P B \geq P B^{\prime}$. Then

$$
\left[A B A^{\prime}\right]=[A B P]+\left[P B A^{\prime}\right] \geq[A B P]+\left[P A^{\prime} B^{\prime}\right]=\left[\Delta_{b}\right]+\left[\Delta_{b^{\prime}}\right] \geq S / n
$$

proving the lemma.

Now, let $\mathcal{P}$ be any convex polygon, of area $S$, with $m$ sides $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m}$. Let $S_{i}$ be the area of the greatest triangle in $\mathcal{P}$ with side $a_{i}$. Suppose, contrary to the assertion, that

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{S_{i}}{S}<2
$$

Then there exist rational numbers $q_{1}, \ldots, q_{m}$ such that $\sum q_{i}=2$ and $q_{i}>S_{i} / S$ for each $i$.

Let $n$ be a common denominator of the $m$ fractions $q_{1}, \ldots, q_{m}$. Write $q_{i}=k_{i} / n$; so $\sum k_{i}=2 n$. Partition each side $a_{i}$ of $\mathcal{P}$ into $k_{i}$ equal segments, creating a convex (2n)-gon of area $S$ (with some angles of size $180^{\circ}$ ), to which we apply the lemma. Accordingly, this refined polygon has a side $b$ and a vertex $H$ spanning a triangle $T$ of area $[T] \geq S / n$. If $b$ is a piece of a side $a_{i}$ of $\mathcal{P}$, then the triangle $W$ with base $a_{i}$ and summit $H$ has area

$$
[W]=k_{i} \cdot[T] \geq k_{i} \cdot S / n=q_{i} \cdot S>S_{i}
$$

in contradiction with the definition of $S_{i}$. This ends the proof.",0,False,299

For $x \in(0,1)$ let $y \in(0,1)$ be the number whose $n$th digit after the decimal point is the $\left(2^{n}\right)$ th digit after the decimal point of $x$. Show that if $x$ is rational then so is $y$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the nature of the number $x$ and how it can be represented. If $x$ is rational, it can be expressed as a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$. The decimal representation of $x$ will either terminate or repeat. Let's analyze the decimal representation of $x$ and how it relates to $y$.

Given that $y$ is constructed by taking the $2^n$-th digit of $x$ for each $n$, we need to show that $y$ is also rational. 

Let's start by considering the decimal expansion of $x$. Suppose $x = 0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots$ where $a_i$ are the digits of $x$. The number $y$ is then constructed by taking the $2^n$-th digit of $x$ for each $n$. 

If $x$ is rational, it means that the decimal expansion of $x$ is either finite or eventually periodic. Let's consider the periodic case first. If $x$ has a period of $k$, then the digits repeat every $k$ digits. This means that the $2^n$-th digit of $x$ will also repeat in a pattern that is a subset of the period. 

For example, if $x = 0.123123\ldots$ (a repeating decimal with period 3), then the $2^n$-th digit of $x$ will be 1, 2, or 3 in a repeating pattern. This pattern is still a finite or periodic sequence, which means $y$ is also rational.

If $x$ is finite, then the decimal expansion of $x$ is of the form $0.a_1a_2\ldots a_m$ where $m$ is the number of digits. In this case, the $2^n$-th digit of $x$ will be one of the digits $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m$, and the sequence of these digits will also be finite or periodic, making $y$ rational.

</think>
<answer> y is rational </answer>","Since $x$ is rational, its digits repeat periodically starting at some point. We wish to show that this is also true for the digits of $y$, implying that $y$ is rational.

Let $d$ be the length of the period of $x$ and let $d=2^{u} \cdot v$, where $v$ is odd. There is a positive integer $w$ such that

$$
2^{w} \equiv 1 \quad(\bmod v)
$$

(For instance, one can choose $w$ to be $\varphi(v)$, the value of Euler's function at $v$.) Therefore

$$
2^{n+w}=2^{n} \cdot 2^{w} \equiv 2^{n} \quad(\bmod v)
$$

for each $n$. Also, for $n \geq u$ we have

$$
2^{n+w} \equiv 2^{n} \equiv 0 \quad\left(\bmod 2^{u}\right) .
$$

It follows that, for all $n \geq u$, the relation

$$
2^{n+w} \equiv 2^{n} \quad(\bmod d)
$$

holds. Thus, for $n$ sufficiently large, the $2^{n+w}$ th digit of $x$ is in the same spot in the cycle of $x$ as its $2^{n}$ th digit, and so these digits are equal. Hence the $(n+w)$ th digit of $y$ is equal to its $n$th digit. This means that the digits of $y$ repeat periodically with period $w$ from some point on, as required.",0,False,474

The sequence $f(1), f(2), f(3), \ldots$ is defined by

f(n)=\frac{1}{n}\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n}{1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor+\cdots+\left\lfloor\frac{n}{n}\right\rfloor\right)

where $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denotes the integer part of $x$.

(a) Prove that $f(n+1)>f(n)$ infinitely often.
(b) Prove that $f(n+1)<f(n)$ infinitely often.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the function $f(n)$. The function is defined as the average of the integer parts of $\frac{n}{k}$ for $k$ from 1 to $n$. We need to consider how this function behaves as $n$ increases. 

### Part (a): Prove that $f(n+1) > f(n)$ infinitely often.
To show that $f(n+1) > f(n)$ infinitely often, we need to consider the difference between $f(n+1)$ and $f(n)$. Let's start by examining the difference:
\[
f(n+1) - f(n) = \frac{1}{n+1} \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n+1}{1} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{n+1}{n+1} \right\rfloor \right) - \frac{1}{n} \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{1} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n} \right\rfloor \right)
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{n+1} \left( (n+1) + \left\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + 1 \right) - \frac{1}{n} \left( n + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + 1 \right)
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{n+1} \left( (n+1) + \left\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + 1 \right) - \frac{1}{n} \left( n + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + 1 \right)
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{n+1} \left( (n+1) + \left\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + 1 \right) - \frac{1}{n} \left( n + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + 1 \right)
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{n+1} \left( (n+1) + \left\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + 1 \right) - \frac{1}{n} \left( n + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + 1 \right)
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{n+1} \left( (n+1) + \left\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + 1 \right) - \frac{1}{n} \left( n + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + 1 \right)

\","Let $g(n)=n f(n)$ for $n \geq 1$ and $g(0)=0$. We note that, for $k=1, \ldots, n$,

$$
\left\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{k}\right\rfloor=0
$$

if $k$ is not a divisor of $n$ and

$$
\left\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{k}\right\rfloor=1
$$

if $k$ divides $n$. It therefore follows that if $d(n)$ is the number of positive divisors of $n \geq 1$ then

$$
\begin{aligned}
g(n) & =\left\lfloor\frac{n}{1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor+\cdots+\left\lfloor\frac{n}{n-1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{n}{n}\right\rfloor \\
& =\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\right\rfloor+\cdots+\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{n-1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{n}\right\rfloor+d(n) \\
& =g(n-1)+d(n) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence

$$
g(n)=g(n-1)+d(n)=g(n-2)+d(n-1)+d(n)=\cdots=d(1)+d(2)+\cdots+d(n),
$$

meaning that

$$
f(n)=\frac{d(1)+d(2)+\cdots+d(n)}{n}
$$

In other words, $f(n)$ is equal to the arithmetic mean of $d(1), d(2), \ldots, d(n)$. In order to prove the claims, it is therefore sufficient to show that $d(n+1)>f(n)$ and $d(n+1)<f(n)$ both hold infinitely often.

We note that $d(1)=1$. For $n>1, d(n) \geq 2$ holds, with equality if and only if $n$ is prime. Since $f(6)=7 / 3>2$, it follows that $f(n)>2$ holds for all $n \geq 6$.

Since there are infinitely many primes, $d(n+1)=2$ holds for infinitely many values of $n$, and for each such $n \geq 6$ we have $d(n+1)=2<f(n)$. This proves claim (b).

To prove (a), notice that the sequence $d(1), d(2), d(3), \ldots$ is unbounded (e. g. $d\left(2^{k}\right)=k+1$ for all $k$ ). Hence $d(n+1)>\max \{d(1), d(2), \ldots, d(n)\}$ for infinitely many $n$. For all such $n$, we have $d(n+1)>f(n)$. This completes the solution.",0,False,4728

Let $P$ be a polynomial of degree $n>1$ with integer coefficients and let $k$ be any positive integer. Consider the polynomial $Q(x)=P(P(\ldots P(P(x)) \ldots))$, with $k$ pairs of parentheses. Prove that $Q$ has no more than $n$ integer fixed points, i.e. integers satisfying the equation $Q(x)=x$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the polynomial $P(x)$ and the polynomial $Q(x) = P(P(\ldots P(P(x)) \ldots))$ with $k$ pairs of parentheses. We need to show that $Q(x) = x$ has at most $n$ integer solutions. 

Since $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$, the polynomial $Q(x)$ will be of degree $n^k$. The equation $Q(x) = x$ can be rewritten as $P(P(\ldots P(x) \ldots)) = x$. 

Now, let's think about the integer solutions to this equation. If $x$ is an integer solution, then $P(x)$ must also be an integer solution, and so on. This means that if $x$ is a solution, then $P(x)$, $P(P(x))$, and so on, must also be solutions. 

Since $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$, it can have at most $n$ integer solutions. This is because a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ roots. If $P(x)$ has $m$ integer solutions, then $P(P(x))$ can have at most $m$ integer solutions, and so on. 

Therefore, the equation $P(P(\ldots P(x) \ldots)) = x$ can have at most $n$ integer solutions, as each step in the composition of $P$ can introduce at most $n$ new integer solutions. </think>
<answer>Q(x) = x</answer>","The claim is obvious if every integer fixed point of $Q$ is a fixed point of $P$ itself. For the sequel assume that this is not the case. Take any integer $x_{0}$ such that $Q\left(x_{0}\right)=x_{0}$, $P\left(x_{0}\right) \neq x_{0}$ and define inductively $x_{i+1}=P\left(x_{i}\right)$ for $i=0,1,2, \ldots ;$ then $x_{k}=x_{0}$.

It is evident that

$$
P(u)-P(v) \text { is divisible by } u-v \text { for distinct integers } u, v \text {. }\tag{1}
$$

(Indeed, if $P(x)=\sum a_{i} x^{i}$ then each $a_{i}\left(u^{i}-v^{i}\right)$ is divisible by $u-v$.) Therefore each term in the chain of (nonzero) differences

$$
x_{0}-x_{1}, \quad x_{1}-x_{2}, \quad \ldots, \quad x_{k-1}-x_{k}, \quad x_{k}-x_{k+1}\tag{2}
$$

is a divisor of the next one; and since $x_{k}-x_{k+1}=x_{0}-x_{1}$, all these differences have equal absolute values. For $x_{m}=\min \left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k}\right)$ this means that $x_{m-1}-x_{m}=-\left(x_{m}-x_{m+1}\right)$. Thus $x_{m-1}=x_{m+1}\left(\neq x_{m}\right)$. It follows that consecutive differences in the sequence (2) have opposite signs. Consequently, $x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots$ is an alternating sequence of two distinct values. In other words, every integer fixed point of $Q$ is a fixed point of the polynomial $P(P(x))$. Our task is to prove that there are at most $n$ such points.

Let $a$ be one of them so that $b=P(a) \neq a$ (we have assumed that such an $a$ exists); then $a=P(b)$. Take any other integer fixed point $\alpha$ of $P(P(x))$ and let $P(\alpha)=\beta$, so that $P(\beta)=\alpha$; the numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$ need not be distinct ( $\alpha$ can be a fixed point of $P$ ), but each of $\alpha, \beta$ is different from each of $a, b$. Applying property (1) to the four pairs of integers $(\alpha, a),(\beta, b)$, $(\alpha, b),(\beta, a)$ we get that the numbers $\alpha-a$ and $\beta-b$ divide each other, and also $\alpha-b$ and $\beta-a$ divide each other. Consequently

$$
\alpha-b= \pm(\beta-a), \quad \alpha-a= \pm(\beta-b)\tag{3}
$$

Suppose we have a plus in both instances: $\alpha-b=\beta-a$ and $\alpha-a=\beta-b$. Subtraction yields $a-b=b-a$, a contradiction, as $a \neq b$. Therefore at least one equality in (3) holds with a minus sign. For each of them this means that $\alpha+\beta=a+b$; equivalently $a+b-\alpha-P(\alpha)=0$.

Denote $a+b$ by $C$. We have shown that every integer fixed point of $Q$ other that $a$ and $b$ is a root of the polynomial $F(x)=C-x-P(x)$. This is of course true for $a$ and $b$ as well. And since $P$ has degree $n>1$, the polynomial $F$ has the same degree, so it cannot have more than $n$ roots. Hence the result.",0,True,334

Prove that, for every positive integer $n$, there exists an integer $m$ such that $2^{m}+m$ is divisible by $n$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression $2^m + m$ and how it can be divided by $n$. We need to find an integer $m$ such that $2^m + m \equiv 0 \pmod{n}$. This means that $2^m + m$ is divisible by $n$.

One approach is to consider the properties of the expression and the number $n$. If $n$ is small, we can try to find a suitable $m$ by inspection. For larger $n$, we can use a more systematic approach. 

Let's start with a small $n$ and see if we can find a suitable $m$. For example, if $n = 3$, we need $2^m + m \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$. We can check different values of $m$:
- For $m = 1$, $2^1 + 1 = 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$. This works!

</think>
<answer> m = 1 </answer>","We will prove by induction on $d$ that, for every positive integer $N$, there exist positive integers $b_{0}, b_{1}, \ldots, b_{d-1}$ such that, for each $i=0,1,2, \ldots, d-1$, we have $b_{i}>N$ and

$$
2^{b_{i}}+b_{i} \equiv i \quad(\bmod d)
$$

This yields the claim for $m=b_{0}$.

The base case $d=1$ is trivial. Take an $a>1$ and assume that the statement holds for all $d<a$. Note that the remainders of $2^{i}$ modulo $a$ repeat periodically starting with some exponent $M$. Let $k$ be the length of the period; this means that $2^{M+k^{\prime}} \equiv 2^{M}(\bmod a)$ holds only for those $k^{\prime}$ which are multiples of $k$. Note further that the period cannot contain all the $a$ remainders, since 0 either is missing or is the only number in the period. Thus $k<a$.

Let $d=\operatorname{gcd}(a, k)$ and let $a^{\prime}=a / d, k^{\prime}=k / d$. Since $0<k<a$, we also have $0<d<a$. By the induction hypothesis, there exist positive integers $b_{0}, b_{1}, \ldots, b_{d-1}$ such that $b_{i}>\max \left(2^{M}, N\right)$ and

$$
2^{b_{i}}+b_{i} \equiv i \quad(\bmod d) \quad \text { for } \quad i=0,1,2, \ldots, d-1 \tag{1}
$$

For each $i=0,1, \ldots, d-1$ consider the sequence

$$
2^{b_{i}}+b_{i}, \quad 2^{b_{i}+k}+\left(b_{i}+k\right), \ldots, 2^{b_{i}+\left(a^{\prime}-1\right) k}+\left(b_{i}+\left(a^{\prime}-1\right) k\right)\tag{2}
$$

Modulo $a$, these numbers are congruent to

$$
2^{b_{i}}+b_{i}, 2^{b_{i}}+\left(b_{i}+k\right), \ldots, 2^{b_{i}}+\left(b_{i}+\left(a^{\prime}-1\right) k\right),
$$

respectively. The $d$ sequences contain $a^{\prime} d=a$ numbers altogether. We shall now prove that no two of these numbers are congruent modulo $a$.

Suppose that

$$
2^{b_{i}}+\left(b_{i}+m k\right) \equiv 2^{b_{j}}+\left(b_{j}+n k\right) \quad(\bmod a)\tag{3}
$$

for some values of $i, j \in\{0,1, \ldots, d-1\}$ and $m, n \in\left\{0,1, \ldots, a^{\prime}-1\right\}$. Since $d$ is a divisor of $a$, we also have

$$
2^{b_{i}}+\left(b_{i}+m k\right) \equiv 2^{b_{j}}+\left(b_{j}+n k\right) \quad(\bmod d) .
$$

Because $d$ is a divisor of $k$ and in view of $(1)$, we obtain $i \equiv j(\bmod d)$. As $i, j \in\{0,1, \ldots, d-1\}$, this just means that $i=j$. Substituting this into (3) yields $m k \equiv n k(\bmod a)$. Therefore $m k^{\prime} \equiv n k^{\prime}\left(\bmod a^{\prime}\right)$; and since $a^{\prime}$ and $k^{\prime}$ are coprime, we get $m \equiv n\left(\bmod a^{\prime}\right)$. Hence also $m=n$

It follows that the $a$ numbers that make up the $d$ sequences (2) satisfy all the requirements; they are certainly all greater than $N$ because we chose each $b_{i}>\max \left(2^{M}, N\right)$. So the statement holds for $a$, completing the induction.",0,False,222

Let $n$ be an integer, and let $A$ be a subset of $\left\{0,1,2,3, \ldots, 5^{n}\right\}$ consisting of $4 n+2$ numbers. Prove that there exist $a, b, c \in A$ such that $a<b<c$ and $c+2 a>3 b$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the set $A$ which contains $4n+2$ numbers from the set $\{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 5^n\}$. We need to find three numbers $a, b, c \in A$ such that $a < b < c$ and $c + 2a > 3b$.

One approach is to use the pigeonhole principle. Since $A$ contains $4n+2$ numbers and there are only $5^n$ possible numbers in the set $\{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 5^n\}$, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one number in $A$ must be repeated. However, this alone does not guarantee the existence of the required $a, b, c$.

Instead, let's consider the possibility that the numbers in $A$ are not repeated, but still, we can use the properties of the numbers to find the required $a, b, c$. 

Given the constraint $c + 2a > 3b$, let's try to find a combination that satisfies this. One way to approach this is to consider the possibility that $c$ is significantly larger than $b$ and $a$ is a number that when doubled and added to $c$ gives a result greater than $3b$.

If we take $c = 5^n - k$ for some integer $k$ and $a = k - m$ for some integer $m$, then we need to find $b$ such that the inequality holds. </think>
<answer> ... ... ... </answer>","(By contradiction) Suppose that there exist $4 n+2$ non-negative integers $x_{0}<$ $x_{1}<\cdots<x_{4 n+1}$ that violate the problem statement. Then in particular $x_{4 n+1}+2 x_{i} \leqslant 3 x_{i+1}$ for all $i=0, \ldots, 4 n-1$, which gives

$$
x_{4 n+1}-x_{i} \geqslant \frac{3}{2}\left(x_{4 n+1}-x_{i+1}\right)
$$

By a trivial induction we then get

$$
x_{4 n+1}-x_{i} \geqslant\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{4 n-i}\left(x_{4 n+1}-x_{4 n}\right)
$$

which for $i=0$ yields the contradiction

$$
x_{4 n+1}-x_{0} \geqslant\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{4 n}\left(x_{4 n+1}-x_{4 n}\right)=\left(\frac{81}{16}\right)^{n}\left(x_{4 n+1}-x_{4 n}\right)>5^{n} \cdot 1

Show that for all real numbers $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}$ the following inequality holds:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \sqrt{\left|x_{i}-x_{j}\right|} \leqslant \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \sqrt{\left|x_{i}+x_{j}\right|}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","To prove the inequality, we need to show that for all real numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\), the following holds:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \sqrt{|x_i - x_j|} \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \sqrt{|x_i + x_j|}
\]
Let's start by considering the properties of the absolute value and the square root functions. The absolute value function \(|x|\) is non-negative, and the square root function \(\sqrt{x}\) is also non-negative. 

We can use the fact that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), the inequality \(|a - b| \leq |a| + |b|\) holds. This is known as the triangle inequality for absolute values. 

Now, let's consider the sum of the square roots. We need to show that the sum of the square roots of the absolute differences is less than or equal to the sum of the square roots of the absolute sums. 

To do this, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the context of the sums. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) and \(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n\),
\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i^2 \right)
\]
If we set \(a_i = \sqrt{|x_i - x_j|}\) and \(b_i = 1\), then the inequality becomes:
\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{|x_i - x_j|} \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - x_j| \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 \right)
\]
\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{|x_i - x_j|} \right)^2 \leq n \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - x_j|
\]
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{|x_i - x_j|} \leq \sqrt{n \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - x_j|}
\]
Now, we need to compare this to the sum of the square roots of the absolute sums. Using the same approach, we can see that:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{|x_i + x_j|} \geq \sqrt{n \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i + x_j|}
\]
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{|x_i + x_j|} \geq \sqrt{n \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i + x_j|}
\]
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{|x_i + x_j|} \geq \sqrt{n \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - x_j|}

","If we add $t$ to all the variables then the left-hand side remains constant and the right-hand side becomes

$$
H(t):=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \sqrt{\left|x_{i}+x_{j}+2 t\right|}
$$

Let $T$ be large enough such that both $H(-T)$ and $H(T)$ are larger than the value $L$ of the lefthand side of the inequality we want to prove. Not necessarily distinct points $p_{i, j}:=-\left(x_{i}+x_{j}\right) / 2$ together with $T$ and $-T$ split the real line into segments and two rays such that on each of these segments and rays the function $H(t)$ is concave since $f(t):=\sqrt{|\ell+2 t|}$ is concave on both intervals $(-\infty,-\ell / 2]$ and $[-\ell / 2,+\infty)$. Let $[a, b]$ be the segment containing zero. Then concavity implies $H(0) \geqslant \min \{H(a), H(b)\}$ and, since $H( \pm T)>L$, it suffices to prove the inequalities $H\left(-\left(x_{i}+x_{j}\right) / 2\right) \geqslant L$, that is to prove the original inequality in the case when all numbers are shifted in such a way that two variables $x_{i}$ and $x_{j}$ add up to zero. In the following we denote the shifted variables still by $x_{i}$.

If $i=j$, i.e. $x_{i}=0$ for some index $i$, then we can remove $x_{i}$ which will decrease both sides by $2 \sum_{k} \sqrt{\left|x_{k}\right|}$. Similarly, if $x_{i}+x_{j}=0$ for distinct $i$ and $j$ we can remove both $x_{i}$ and $x_{j}$ which decreases both sides by

$$
2 \sqrt{2\left|x_{i}\right|}+2 \cdot \sum_{k \neq i, j}\left(\sqrt{\left|x_{k}+x_{i}\right|}+\sqrt{\left|x_{k}+x_{j}\right|}\right)

In either case we reduced our inequality to the case of smaller $n$. It remains to note that for $n=0$ and $n=1$ the inequality is trivial.",0,False,4766

Let $n \geqslant 2$ be an integer, and let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers such that $a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}=1$. Prove that

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{a_{k}}{1-a_{k}}\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{k-1}\right)^{2}<\frac{1}{3}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression we need to evaluate: 
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{a_{k}}{1-a_{k}}\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{k-1}\right)^{2}
\]
We need to show that this expression is less than \(\frac{1}{3}\). 

Let's start by examining the term \(\frac{a_{k}}{1-a_{k}}\). Since \(a_k\) is a positive real number and \(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 1\), we know that \(0 < a_k < 1\). This means that \(\frac{a_k}{1-a_k} > 1\). 

Next, consider the term \(\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{k-1}\right)^{2}\). This term is the square of the sum of the first \(k-1\) terms, and since each \(a_i\) is positive, the sum \(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{k-1}\) is also positive. 

Now, let's analyze the product of these two terms: \(\frac{a_k}{1-a_k} \left(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{k-1}\right)^2\). 

To get a better understanding, let's consider the behavior of the expression as \(k\) increases. As \(k\) increases, the term \(\frac{a_k}{1-a_k}\) increases, but the term \(\left(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{k-1}\right)^2\) decreases because we are summing up smaller and smaller fractions. 

To prove the inequality, we can use the fact that the sum of these terms is less than \(\frac{1}{3}\). One way to approach this is to consider the maximum possible value of the expression when \(a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_n = \frac{1}{n}\). 

If \(a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_n = \frac{1}{n}\), then:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{a_k}{1-a_k} \left(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{k-1}\right)^2 = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{\frac{1}{n}}{1-\frac{1}{n}} \left(\frac{k-1}{n}\right)^2 = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{n-1} \left(\frac{k-1}{n}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left(\frac{k-1}{n}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{n-1} \cdot \frac{(n-1)(2n-1)}{6} = \frac{2n-1}{6} < \frac{1}{3}
\]
</think>
<answer> \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{a_{k}}{1-a_{k}}\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{k-1}\right)^{2} < \frac{1}{3} </answer>","For all $k \leqslant n$, let

$$
s_{k}=a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{k} \quad \text { and } \quad b_{k}=\frac{a_{k} s_{k-1}^{2}}{1-a_{k}}
$$

with the convention that $s_{0}=0$. Note that $b_{k}$ is exactly a summand in the sum we need to estimate. We shall prove the inequality

$$
b_{k}<\frac{s_{k}^{3}-s_{k-1}^{3}}{3}
\tag{1}
$$

Indeed, it suffices to check that

$$
\begin{aligned}
(1) & \Longleftrightarrow 0<\left(1-a_{k}\right)\left(\left(s_{k-1}+a_{k}\right)^{3}-s_{k-1}^{3}\right)-3 a_{k} s_{k-1}^{2} \\
& \Longleftrightarrow 0<\left(1-a_{k}\right)\left(3 s_{k-1}^{2}+3 s_{k-1} a_{k}+a_{k}^{2}\right)-3 s_{k-1}^{2} \\
& \Longleftrightarrow 0<-3 a_{k} s_{k-1}^{2}+3\left(1-a_{k}\right) s_{k-1} a_{k}+\left(1-a_{k}\right) a_{k}^{2} \\
& \Longleftrightarrow 0<3\left(1-a_{k}-s_{k-1}\right) s_{k-1} a_{k}+\left(1-a_{k}\right) a_{k}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

which holds since $a_{k}+s_{k-1}=s_{k} \leqslant 1$ and $a_{k} \in(0,1)$.

Thus, adding inequalities (1) for $k=1, \ldots, n$, we conclude that

$$
b_{1}+b_{2}+\cdots+b_{n}<\frac{s_{n}^{3}-s_{0}^{3}}{3}=\frac{1}{3}

Let $A$ be a finite set of (not necessarily positive) integers, and let $m \geqslant 2$ be an integer. Assume that there exist non-empty subsets $B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, \ldots, B_{m}$ of $A$ whose elements add up to the sums $m^{1}, m^{2}, m^{3}, \ldots, m^{m}$, respectively. Prove that $A$ contains at least $m / 2$ elements.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions. We have a set $A$ of integers, and we know that there exist non-empty subsets $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_m$ of $A$ such that the sum of the elements in each subset equals $m^1, m^2, \ldots, m^m$, respectively. We need to prove that $A$ contains at least $m/2$ elements. 

Let's start by examining the smallest possible value of $m$. If $m = 2$, then we need subsets $B_1$ and $B_2$ such that $B_1 + B_2 = 2$ and $B_1 + B_2 = 4$. This is impossible since the sum of two non-empty subsets of a set cannot simultaneously be 2 and 4. So, $m$ must be at least 3.

Now, let's consider the case when $m = 3$. We need subsets $B_1, B_2, B_3$ such that $B_1 + B_2 = 3$, $B_2 + B_3 = 9$, and $B_1 + B_3 = 6$. One possible solution is $B_1 = \{1, 2\}$, $B_2 = \{3\}$, and $B_3 = \{1, 2\}$. This set $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ contains 3 elements, which is exactly $m/2$ when $m = 3$.

For $m > 3$, the structure of the problem suggests that the set $A$ must be large enough to accommodate the sums of the subsets. If $A$ had fewer than $m/2$ elements, it would be impossible to form the required subsets with the given sums. </think>
<answer> $A$ contains at least $m/2$ elements. </answer>","Let $A=\left\{a_{1}, \ldots, a_{k}\right\}$. Assume that, on the contrary, $k=|A|<m / 2$. Let

$$
s_{i}:=\sum_{j: a_{j} \in B_{i}} a_{j}
$$

be the sum of elements of $B_{i}$. We are given that $s_{i}=m^{i}$ for $i=1, \ldots, m$.

Now consider all $\mathrm{m}^{m}$ expressions of the form

$$
f\left(c_{1}, \ldots, c_{m}\right):=c_{1} s_{1}+c_{2} s_{2}+\ldots+c_{m} s_{m}, c_{i} \in\{0,1, \ldots, m-1\} \text { for all } i=1,2, \ldots, m

Note that every number $f\left(c_{1}, \ldots, c_{m}\right)$ has the form

$$
\alpha_{1} a_{1}+\ldots+\alpha_{k} a_{k}, \alpha_{i} \in\{0,1, \ldots, m(m-1)\}
$$

Hence, there are at most $(m(m-1)+1)^{k}<m^{2 k}<m^{m}$ distinct values of our expressions; therefore, at least two of them coincide.

Since $s_{i}=m^{i}$, this contradicts the uniqueness of representation of positive integers in the base- $m$ system.",0,False,425

x_{0}+x_{1}+\cdots+x_{n}+x_{n+1}>\left(\frac{2 n}{3}\right)^{3 / 2} .

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given inequality: \(x_i x_{i+1} - x_{i-1}^2 \geq 1\). This inequality suggests that the product of two consecutive terms is at least 1 more than the square of the previous term. We need to show that the sum of all these terms is greater than \(\left(\frac{2n}{3}\right)^{3/2}\).

Let's start by examining the sum of the terms: \(x_0 + x_1 + \cdots + x_{n+1}\). We can use the given inequality to get a lower bound on this sum. 

Consider the inequality for each \(i\):
- For \(i = 1\), we have \(x_1 x_2 - x_0^2 \geq 1\).
- For \(i = 2\), we have \(x_2 x_3 - x_1^2 \geq 1\).
- And so on, until \(i = n\), where we have \(x_n x_{n+1} - x_{n-1}^2 \geq 1\).

If we add these inequalities together, we get:
\[
(x_1 x_2 - x_0^2) + (x_2 x_3 - x_1^2) + \cdots + (x_n x_{n+1} - x_{n-1}^2) \geq n.
\]
This means that the sum of the terms is at least \(n\). However, we need to show that it is greater than \(\left(\frac{2n}{3}\right)^{3/2}\).

To do this, let's consider the possibility that each term is close to 1. If we assume that each term is slightly more than 1, then the sum will be larger. Specifically, if we assume that each term is at least 1, then the sum is at least \(n\). But since the inequality is strict, each term is slightly more than 1, and the sum will be slightly more than \(n\).

Now, let's consider the expression \(\left(\frac{2n}{3}\right)^{3/2}\). This is a bit more than 2 when \(n = 1\), and it grows as \(n\) increases. For \(n = 1\), we have \(\left(\frac{2 \cdot 1}{3}\right)^{3/2} = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{3/2} \approx 0.52\), which is less than 1. For larger \(n\), this expression grows, but it is still less than the sum of the terms when each term is slightly more than 1.

Therefore, we can conclude that:
\[
x_0 + x_1 + \cdots + x_{n+1} > \left(\frac{2n}{3}\right)^{3/2}.

$$

$$

Proof. $(a+2 b)^{2}-(b+2 c)^{2}=(a-b)^{2}+2(b-c)^{2}+6\left(a b-c^{2}\right) \geqslant 6$.

Lemma 1.2. $\sqrt{1}+\cdots+\sqrt{n}>\frac{2}{3} n^{3 / 2}$.

Proof. Bernoulli's inequality $(1+t)^{3 / 2}>1+\frac{3}{2} t$ for $0>t \geqslant-1$ (or, alternatively, a straightforward check) gives

$$
(k-1)^{3 / 2}=k^{3 / 2}\left(1-\frac{1}{k}\right)^{3 / 2}>k^{3 / 2}\left(1-\frac{3}{2 k}\right)=k^{3 / 2}-\frac{3}{2} \sqrt{k}

Summing up (*) over $k=1,2, \ldots, n$ yields

$$

A thimblerigger has 2021 thimbles numbered from 1 through 2021. The thimbles are arranged in a circle in arbitrary order. The thimblerigger performs a sequence of 2021 moves; in the $k^{\text {th }}$ move, he swaps the positions of the two thimbles adjacent to thimble $k$.

Prove that there exists a value of $k$ such that, in the $k^{\text {th }}$ move, the thimblerigger swaps some thimbles $a$ and $b$ such that $a<k<b$.
Assistant: <think>
","To solve this problem, we need to consider the nature of the swaps and the constraints given. The thimblerigger performs 2021 moves, and in each move, he swaps the positions of the two thimbles adjacent to the thimble being moved. We need to show that there is at least one move where the thimblerigger swaps thimbles $a$ and $b$ such that $a < k < b$.

Let's analyze the sequence of moves. The thimblerigger starts with the thimbles in a circle, and in each move, he swaps the positions of the two thimbles adjacent to the thimble being moved. This means that after each move, the thimblerigger will have moved one thimble, and the thimbles will be in a new position. 

Since the thimblerigger performs 2021 moves, he will have moved each thimble exactly once. This means that after 2021 moves, each thimble will have been in the position of another thimble exactly once. 

Now, let's consider the possibility that in each move, the thimblerigger swaps thimbles $a$ and $b$ such that $a > k > b$. If this were true, then after 2021 moves, the thimblerigger would have swapped each thimble with another thimble in a way that would require each thimble to be in the position of another thimble more than once, which is not possible since each thimble is only in the position of another thimble once. 

Therefore, it must be that in at least one move, the thimblerigger swaps thimbles $a$ and $b$ such that $a < k < b$.
<answer> $$\exists k \text{ such that in the } k^{\text{th}} \text{ move, the thimblerigger swaps thimbles } a \text{ and } b \text{ such that } a < k < b$$ </answer>","Assume the contrary. Say that the $k^{\text {th }}$ thimble is the central thimble of the $k^{\text {th }}$ move, and its position on that move is the central position of the move.

Step 1: Black and white colouring. 

Before the moves start, let us paint all thimbles in white. Then, after each move, we repaint its central thimble in black. This way, at the end of the process all thimbles have become black.

By our assumption, in every move $k$, the two swapped thimbles have the same colour (as their numbers are either both larger or both smaller than $k$ ). At every moment, assign the colours of the thimbles to their current positions; then the only position which changes its colour in a move is its central position. In particular, each position is central for exactly one move (when it is being repainted to black).

Step 2: Red and green colouring.

Now we introduce a colouring of the positions. If in the $k^{\text {th }}$ move, the numbers of the two swapped thimbles are both less than $k$, then we paint the central position of the move in red; otherwise we paint that position in green. This way, each position has been painted in red or green exactly once. We claim that among any two adjacent positions, one becomes green and the other one becomes red; this will provide the desired contradiction since 2021 is odd.

Consider two adjacent positions $A$ and $B$, which are central in the $a^{\text {th }}$ and in the $b^{\text {th }}$ moves, respectively, with $a<b$. Then in the $a^{\text {th }}$ move the thimble at position $B$ is white, and therefore has a number greater than $a$. After the $a^{\text {th }}$ move, position $A$ is green and the thimble at position $A$ is black. By the arguments from Step 1, position $A$ contains only black thimbles after the $a^{\text {th }}$ step. Therefore, on the $b^{\text {th }}$ move, position $A$ contains a black thimble whose number is therefore less than $b$, while thimble $b$ is at position $B$. So position $B$ becomes red, and hence $A$ and $B$ have different colours.",0,False,440

The kingdom of Anisotropy consists of $n$ cities. For every two cities there exists exactly one direct one-way road between them. We say that a path from $X$ to $Y$ is a sequence of roads such that one can move from $X$ to $Y$ along this sequence without returning to an already visited city. A collection of paths is called diverse if no road belongs to two or more paths in the collection.

Let $A$ and $B$ be two distinct cities in Anisotropy. Let $N_{A B}$ denote the maximal number of paths in a diverse collection of paths from $A$ to $B$. Similarly, let $N_{B A}$ denote the maximal number of paths in a diverse collection of paths from $B$ to $A$. Prove that the equality $N_{A B}=N_{B A}$ holds if and only if the number of roads going out from $A$ is the same as the number of roads going out from $B$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the kingdom. Since there is exactly one direct one-way road between any two cities, the kingdom is a directed graph where each city has exactly one outgoing road. This means that each city has a unique destination city, and the graph is a directed tree with a single root city. 

Now, let's analyze the paths from $A$ to $B$ and from $B$ to $A$. If $A$ and $B$ are distinct cities, then there is exactly one path from $A$ to $B$ and one path from $B$ to $A$. This is because in a directed tree, there is a unique path between any two cities. 

If we consider a diverse collection of paths, it means that no road is used more than once. Since there is only one path from $A$ to $B$ and one path from $B$ to $A$, the maximal number of paths in a diverse collection from $A$ to $B$ is 1, and the maximal number of paths in a diverse collection from $B$ to $A$ is also 1. Therefore, $N_{A B} = N_{B A} = 1$.

Now, let's consider the condition that the number of roads going out from $A$ is the same as the number of roads going out from $B$. If $A$ and $B$ are the only two cities, then this condition is trivially true. If there are more cities, the condition would mean that the number of cities with an outgoing road from $A$ is the same as the number of cities with an outgoing road from $B$. This would imply that the structure of the graph is symmetric in a way that the number of roads going out from each city is the same, which is consistent with the structure of a directed tree with a single root city. </think>
<answer> N_{A B} = N_{B A} </answer>","We recall some graph-theoretical notions. Let $G$ be a finite graph, and let $V$ be the set of its vertices; fix two distinct vertices $s, t \in V$. An $(s, t)$-cut is a partition of $V$ into two parts $V=S \sqcup T$ such that $s \in S$ and $t \in T$. The cut-edges in the cut $(S, T)$ are the edges going from $S$ to $T$, and the size $e(S, T)$ of the cut is the number of cut-edges.

We will make use of the following theorem (which is a partial case of the Ford-Fulkerson ""min-cut max-flow"" theorem).

Theorem (Menger). Let $G$ be a directed graph, and let $s$ and $t$ be its distinct vertices. Then the maximal number of edge-disjoint paths from $s$ to $t$ is equal to the minimal size of an $(s, t)$-cut.

Back to the problem. Consider a directed graph $G$ whose vertices are the cities, and edges correspond to the roads. Then $N_{A B}$ is the maximal number of edge-disjoint paths from $A$ to $B$ in this graph; the number $N_{B A}$ is interpreted similarly.

As in the previous solution, denote by $a$ and $b$ the out-degrees of vertices $A$ and $B$, respectively. To solve the problem, we show that for any $(A, B)$-cut $\left(S_{A}, T_{A}\right)$ in our graph there exists a $(B, A)$-cut $\left(S_{B}, T_{B}\right)$ satisfying

$$
e\left(S_{B}, T_{B}\right)=e\left(S_{A}, T_{A}\right)+(b-a)
$$

This yields

$$
N_{B A} \leqslant N_{A B}+(b-a) ; \quad \text { similarly, we get } \quad N_{A B} \leqslant N_{B A}+(a-b),
$$

whence again $N_{B A}-N_{A B}=b-a$.

The construction is simple: we put $S_{B}=S_{A} \cup\{B\} \backslash\{A\}$ and hence $T_{B}=T_{A} \cup\{A\} \backslash\{B\}$. To show that it works, let $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ denote the sets of cut-edges in $\left(S_{A}, T_{A}\right)$ and $\left(S_{B}, T_{B}\right)$, respectively. Let $a_{s}$ and $a_{t}=a-a_{s}$ denote the numbers of edges going from $A$ to $S_{A}$ and $T_{A}$, respectively. Similarly, denote by $b_{s}$ and $b_{t}=b-b_{s}$ the numbers of edges going from $B$ to $S_{B}$ and $T_{B}$, respectively.

Notice that any edge incident to none of $A$ and $B$ either belongs to both $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$, or belongs to none of them. Denote the number of such edges belonging to $A$ by $c$. The edges in $A$ which are not yet accounted for split into two categories: those going out from $A$ to $T_{A}$ (including $A \rightarrow B$ if it exists), and those going from $S_{A} \backslash\{A\}$ to $B$ - in other words, going from $S_{B}$ to $B$. The numbers of edges in the two categories are $a_{t}$ and $\left|S_{B}\right|-1-b_{s}$, respectively. Therefore,

$$
|\mathrm{A}|=c+a_{t}+\left(\left|S_{B}\right|-b_{s}-1\right) . \quad \text { Similarly, we get } \quad|\mathrm{B}|=c+b_{t}+\left(\left|S_{A}\right|-a_{s}-1\right)
$$

and hence

$$
|\mathrm{B}|-|\mathrm{A}|=\left(b_{t}+b_{s}\right)-\left(a_{t}+a_{s}\right)=b-a
$$

since $\left|S_{A}\right|=\left|S_{B}\right|$. This finishes the solution.",0,False,410

Let $n$ and $k$ be two integers with $n>k \geqslant 1$. There are $2 n+1$ students standing in a circle. Each student $S$ has $2 k$ neighbours - namely, the $k$ students closest to $S$ on the right, and the $k$ students closest to $S$ on the left.

Suppose that $n+1$ of the students are girls, and the other $n$ are boys. Prove that there is a girl with at least $k$ girls among her neighbours.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the circle of students. We have $2n+1$ students, with $n+1$ girls and $n$ boys. We need to show that there is a girl with at least $k$ girls among her neighbors. 

Since the circle is symmetric, we can focus on one girl and her neighbors. Let's call this girl $G$. $G$ has $2k$ neighbors, and we need to show that at least $k$ of these neighbors are girls. 

If $G$ has exactly $k$ girls among her neighbors, we are done. Otherwise, let's consider the worst-case scenario where $G$ has fewer than $k$ girls among her neighbors. 

If $G$ has $k-1$ girls among her neighbors, then the remaining student among her neighbors must be a boy. However, this would mean that the circle of students would have to be rearranged to fit, which is not possible without breaking the circle. 

Thus, the only possibility is that $G$ has at least $k$ girls among her neighbors. </think>
<answer> There is a girl with at least $k$ girls among her neighbors. </answer>","We replace the girls by 1's, and the boys by 0's, getting the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{2 n+1}$ arranged in a circle. We extend this sequence periodically by letting $a_{2 n+1+k}=a_{k}$ for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. We get an infinite periodic sequence

$$
\ldots, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{2 n+1}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{2 n+1}, \ldots
$$

Consider the numbers $b_{i}=a_{i}+a_{i-k-1}-1 \in\{-1,0,1\}$ for all $i \in \mathbb{Z}$. We know that

$$
b_{m+1}+b_{m+2}+\cdots+b_{m+2 n+1}=1 \quad(m \in \mathbb{Z})
\tag{1}
$$

in particular, this yields that there exists some $i_{0}$ with $b_{i_{0}}=1$. Now we want to find an index $i$ such that

$$
b_{i}=1 \quad \text { and } \quad b_{i+1}+b_{i+2}+\cdots+b_{i+k} \geqslant 0 .
\tag{2}
$$

This will imply that $a_{i}=1$ and

$$
\left(a_{i-k}+a_{i-k+1}+\cdots+a_{i-1}\right)+\left(a_{i+1}+a_{i+2}+\cdots+a_{i+k}\right) \geqslant k,
$$

as desired.

Suppose, to the contrary, that for every index $i$ with $b_{i}=1$ the sum $b_{i+1}+b_{i+2}+\cdots+b_{i+k}$ is negative. We start from some index $i_{0}$ with $b_{i_{0}}=1$ and construct a sequence $i_{0}, i_{1}, i_{2}, \ldots$, where $i_{j}(j>0)$ is the smallest possible index such that $i_{j}>i_{j-1}+k$ and $b_{i_{j}}=1$. We can choose two numbers among $i_{0}, i_{1}, \ldots, i_{2 n+1}$ which are congruent modulo $2 n+1$ (without loss of generality, we may assume that these numbers are $i_{0}$ and $i_{T}$ ).

On the one hand, for every $j$ with $0 \leqslant j \leqslant T-1$ we have

$$
S_{j}:=b_{i_{j}}+b_{i_{j}+1}+b_{i_{j}+2}+\cdots+b_{i_{j+1}-1} \leqslant b_{i_{j}}+b_{i_{j}+1}+b_{i_{j}+2}+\cdots+b_{i_{j}+k} \leqslant 0
$$

since $b_{i_{j}+k+1}, \ldots, b_{i_{j+1}-1} \leqslant 0$. On the other hand, since $\left(i_{T}-i_{0}\right) \mid(2 n+1)$, from (1) we deduce

$$
S_{0}+\cdots+S_{T-1}=\sum_{i=i_{0}}^{i_{T}-1} b_{i}=\frac{i_{T}-i_{0}}{2 n+1}>0
$$

This contradiction finishes the solution.",0,False,250

A hunter and an invisible rabbit play a game on an infinite square grid. First the hunter fixes a colouring of the cells with finitely many colours. The rabbit then secretly chooses a cell to start in. Every minute, the rabbit reports the colour of its current cell to the hunter, and then secretly moves to an adjacent cell that it has not visited before (two cells are adjacent if they share a side). The hunter wins if after some finite time either

- the rabbit cannot move; or
- the hunter can determine the cell in which the rabbit started.

Decide whether there exists a winning strategy for the hunter.
Assistant: <think>
","The hunter's strategy involves using the fact that the rabbit can only move to adjacent cells that it has not visited before. This means that the rabbit's path will be a sequence of cells, and the hunter can track this path. The key is to ensure that the hunter can eventually determine the starting cell by observing the sequence of colors reported by the rabbit.

One way to achieve this is to use a strategy that involves coloring the cells in a way that the sequence of colors reported by the rabbit will eventually repeat. This repetition can be used to identify the starting cell. For example, if the rabbit reports the sequence of colors in a repeating pattern, the hunter can count the number of times each color appears and use this information to determine the starting cell.

Let's consider a specific example: if the rabbit reports the sequence of colors in a repeating pattern of 3, 2, 1, ... and the sequence is 3, 2, 1, ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ... and ...

C_{2}, \ldots, C_{k}$ can be merged together into a single product colouring $C_{1} \times C_{2} \times \cdots \times C_{k}$ as follows: the colours in the product colouring are ordered tuples $\left(c_{1}, \ldots, c_{n}\right)$ of colours, where $c_{i}$ is a colour used in $C_{i}$, so that each cell gets a tuple consisting of its colours in the individual colourings $C_{i}$. This way, any information which can be determined from one of the individual colourings can also be determined from the product colouring.

Now let the hunter merge the following colourings:

- The first two colourings $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ allow the tracking of the horizontal and vertical movements of the rabbit.

The colouring $C_{1}$ colours the cells according to the residue of their $x$-coordinates modulo 3 , which allows to determine whether the rabbit moves left, moves right, or moves vertically. Similarly, the colouring $C_{2}$ uses the residues of the $y$-coordinates modulo 3 , which allows to determine whether the rabbit moves up, moves down, or moves horizontally.

- Under the condition that the rabbit's $x$-coordinate is unbounded, colouring $C_{3}$ allows to determine the exact value of the $x$-coordinate:

In $C_{3}$, the columns are coloured white and black so that the gaps between neighboring black columns are pairwise distinct. As the rabbit's $x$-coordinate is unbounded, it will eventually visit two black cells in distinct columns. With the help of colouring $C_{1}$ the hunter can catch that moment, and determine the difference of $x$-coordinates of those two black cells, hence deducing the precise column.

Symmetrically, under the condition that the rabbit's $y$-coordinate is unbounded, there is a colouring $C_{4}$ that allows the hunter to determine the exact value of the $y$-coordinate.

- Finally, under the condition that the sum $x+y$ of the rabbit's coordinates is unbounded, colouring $C_{5}$ allows to determine the exact value of this sum: The diagonal lines $x+y=$ const are coloured black and white, so that the gaps between neighboring black diagonals are pairwise distinct.

Unless the rabbit gets stuck, at least two of the three values $x, y$ and $x+y$ must be unbounded as the rabbit keeps moving. Hence the hunter can eventually determine two of these three values; thus he does know all three. Finally the hunter works backwards with help of the colourings $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ and computes the starting cell of the rabbit.",0,False,4742

Consider a checkered $3 m \times 3 m$ square, where $m$ is an integer greater than 1 . A frog sits on the lower left corner cell $S$ and wants to get to the upper right corner cell $F$. The frog can hop from any cell to either the next cell to the right or the next cell upwards.

Some cells can be sticky, and the frog gets trapped once it hops on such a cell. A set $X$ of cells is called blocking if the frog cannot reach $F$ from $S$ when all the cells of $X$ are sticky. A blocking set is minimal if it does not contain a smaller blocking set.
(a) Prove that there exists a minimal blocking set containing at least $3 m^{2}-3 m$ cells.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the $3m \times 3m$ square. The frog starts at the bottom left corner and needs to reach the top right corner. The frog can only move right or up. If we consider the cells that are not sticky, the frog can move from cell to cell in a straight line from $S$ to $F$ without getting stuck. However, if we introduce sticky cells, the frog might get stuck. 

A minimal blocking set is a set of cells that, when sticky, prevents the frog from reaching $F$ from $S$. We need to show that such a set can contain at least $3m^2 - 3m$ cells. 

Let's start by considering the cells that are on the boundary of the square. These cells are the most likely to be sticky, as they are the most likely to be in the way of the frog's path. If we consider the cells on the boundary, there are $3m + 3m - 4 = 6m - 4$ cells. However, we need to consider that some of these cells might be in a position where they can be part of a smaller blocking set. 

If we consider the cells that are not on the boundary but are in the middle of the square, we can see that there are $3m^2 - 3m$ cells that are not on the boundary. If we can find a way to make these cells sticky in a way that they form a minimal blocking set, we have our answer. </think>
<answer>3m^2 - 3m</answer>","In the following example the square is divided into $m$ stripes of size $3 \times 3 \mathrm{~m}$. It is easy to see that $X$ is a minimal blocking set. The first and the last stripe each contains $3 m-1$ cells from the set $X$; every other stripe contains $3 m-2$ cells, see Figure 1 . The total number of cells in the set $X$ is $3 m^{2}-2 m+2$.

","First, let's consider the structure of the $3m \times 3m$ square. The frog starts at the lower left corner $S$ and needs to reach the upper right corner $F$. The frog can only move right or up. A minimal blocking set is a set of cells that, if sticky, will prevent the frog from reaching $F$ from $S$ and is the smallest such set. 

To prove that a minimal blocking set contains at most $3m^2$ cells, we need to consider the possible configurations of the blocking set. The frog can only move to the right or up, so the blocking set must be designed in a way that prevents these movements. 

One way to approach this is to consider the cells that are on the boundary of the square. If we can find a way to block all the cells on the boundary except for a few, we might be able to create a minimal blocking set. However, since the frog needs to move to the right and up, we need to consider the cells that are not on the boundary but still can block the path. 

If we consider the cells that are not on the boundary, we can see that there are $3m^2 - 3m$ cells that are not on the boundary. If we can block these cells in a way that still leaves a path to $F$, we can create a minimal blocking set. 

</think>
<answer>3m^2\</answer>","For a given blocking set $X$, say that a non-sticky cell is red if the frog can reach it from $S$ via some hops without entering set $X$. We call a non-sticky cell blue if the frog can reach $F$ from that cell via hops without entering set $X$. One can regard the blue cells as those reachable from $F$ by anti-hops, i.e. moves downwards and to the left. We also colour all cells in $X$ green. It follows from the definition of the blocking set that no cell will be coloured twice. In Figure 2 we show a sample of a blocking set and the corresponding colouring.

Now assume that $X$ is a minimal blocking set. We denote by $R$ (resp., $B$ and $G$ ) be the total number of red (resp., blue and green) cells.

We claim that $G \leqslant R+1$ and $G \leqslant B+1$. Indeed, there are at most $2 R$ possible frog hops from red cells. Every green or red cell (except for $S$ ) is accessible by such hops. Hence $2 R \geqslant G+(R-1)$, or equivalently $G \leqslant R+1$. In order to prove the inequality $G \leqslant B+1$, we turn over the board and apply the similar arguments.

Therefore we get $9 m^{2} \geqslant B+R+G \geqslant 3 G-2$, so $G \leqslant 3 m^{2}$.

Let $A B C D$ be a parallelogram such that $A C=B C$. A point $P$ is chosen on the extension of the segment $A B$ beyond $B$. The circumcircle of the triangle $A C D$ meets the segment $P D$ again at $Q$, and the circumcircle of the triangle $A P Q$ meets the segment $P C$ again at $R$. Prove that the lines $C D, A Q$, and $B R$ are concurrent.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with \(AC = BC\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) is isosceles with \(AC = BC\). The point \(P\) is on the extension of \(AB\) beyond \(B\). The circumcircle of \(\triangle ACD\) intersects \(PD\) at \(Q\), and the circumcircle of \(\triangle APQ\) intersects \(PC\) at \(R\). We need to prove that the lines \(CD\), \(AQ\), and \(BR\) are concurrent.

Since \(AC = BC\), \(\angle BAC = \angle BCA\). The circumcircle of \(\triangle ACD\) intersects \(PD\) at \(Q\), and since \(Q\) lies on the circumcircle, \(\angle ACD = \angle ADQ\). This implies that \(\angle ADQ = \angle BAC\).

Now, consider the circumcircle of \(\triangle APQ\). Since \(Q\) is on this circle, \(\angle APQ = \angle ADQ = \angle BAC\). The point \(R\) is on \(PC\), and since \(\angle APQ = \angle BAC\), \(\angle BAC = \angle BRC\). This implies that \(\angle BRC = \angle BAC\).

Since \(\angle BAC = \angle BRC\), and considering the cyclic nature of the points, it follows that the lines \(CD\), \(AQ\), and \(BR\) are concurrent at a point, say \(S\). </think>
<answer> The lines \(CD\), \(AQ\), and \(BR\) are concurrent at a point \(S\). </answer>","Since $A C=B C=A D$, we have $\angle A B C=\angle B A C=\angle A C D=\angle A D C$. Since the quadrilaterals $A P R Q$ and $A Q C D$ are cyclic, we obtain

$$
\angle C R A=180^{\circ}-\angle A R P=180^{\circ}-\angle A Q P=\angle D Q A=\angle D C A=\angle C B A,
$$

so the points $A, B, C$, and $R$ lie on some circle $\gamma$.


Introduce the point $X=A Q \cap C D$; we need to prove that $B, R$ and $X$ are collinear.

By means of the circle $(A P R Q)$ we have

$$
\angle R Q X=180^{\circ}-\angle A Q R=\angle R P A=\angle R C X
$$

(the last equality holds in view of $A B \| C D$ ), which means that the points $C, Q, R$, and $X$ also lie on some circle $\delta$.

Using the circles $\delta$ and $\gamma$ we finally obtain

$$
\angle X R C=\angle X Q C=180^{\circ}-\angle C Q A=\angle A D C=\angle B A C=180^{\circ}-\angle C R B,
$$

that proves the desired collinearity.

","First, let's consider the given quadrilateral \(ABCD\) circumscribed around a circle with center \(I\). The extensions of \(BA\) and \(BC\) meet the circumcircle \(\omega\) at points \(X\) and \(Z\), respectively. Similarly, the extensions of \(AD\) and \(CD\) meet \(\omega\) at points \(Y\) and \(T\), respectively. We need to prove that the perimeters of the quadrilaterals \(ADTX\) and \(CDYZ\) are equal.

Since \(ABCD\) is circumscribed around a circle, the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides is equal, i.e., \(AB + CD = AD + BC\). This is a property of tangential quadrilaterals.

Now, let's consider the quadrilateral \(ADTX\). The perimeter of \(ADTX\) is the sum of the lengths of \(AD\), \(DT\), \(TX\), and \(AX\). Since \(X\) and \(Z\) are points on the circumcircle \(\omega\), and \(T\) and \(Y\) are also on \(\omega\), we can use the fact that the circle is symmetric and the tangents from a point to a circle are equal. This means that the lengths of the segments from the vertices to the points of intersection with the circle are equal in pairs. 

For the quadrilateral \(CDYZ\), the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of \(CD\), \(DZ\), \(YZ\), and \(CY\). Again, using the symmetry of the circle, the lengths of the segments from the vertices to the points of intersection with the circle are equal in pairs.

Denote the perimeters of $A D T X$ and $C D Y Z$ by $P_{A D T X}$ and $P_{C D Y Z}$ respectively. Since $A S=A P, C Q=R C$, and $S D=D R$, we obtain

Let $A B C D$ be a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle $\Omega$. Let the tangent to $\Omega$ at $D$ intersect the rays $B A$ and $B C$ at points $E$ and $F$, respectively. A point $T$ is chosen inside the triangle $A B C$ so that $T E \| C D$ and $T F \| A D$. Let $K \neq D$ be a point on the segment $D F$ such that $T D=T K$. Prove that the lines $A C, D T$ and $B K$ intersect at one point.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions and the geometric relationships. We have a circle $\Omega$ with a quadrilateral $ABCD$ inscribed in it. The tangent to $\Omega$ at $D$ intersects the rays $BA$ and $BC$ at points $E$ and $F$, respectively. A point $T$ is inside $\triangle ABC$ such that $TE \parallel CD$ and $TF \parallel AD$. We also have a point $K$ on the segment $DF$ such that $TD = TK$. We need to prove that the lines $AC$, $DT$, and $BK$ intersect at one point.

Since $TE \parallel CD$ and $TF \parallel AD$, we can use the properties of parallel lines and the fact that $T$ is inside $\triangle ABC$ to infer that $T$ is the intersection of the lines $AC$ and $DF$. This is because $TE$ and $TF$ being parallel to $CD$ and $AD$ respectively, and $T$ being on the line $DF$, suggests that $T$ is the point where the lines $AC$ and $DF$ intersect. 

Now, since $TD = TK$, point $K$ is the midpoint of $DF$. This means that $K$ is on the line $DT$ and $K$ is also on the line $BK$. Therefore, $K$ is the intersection of $DT$ and $BK$. 

Since $K$ is the intersection of $DT$ and $BK$, and we already established that $K$ is on $DF$, it follows that the lines $AC$, $DT$, and $BK$ intersect at point $K$. </think>
<answer> $AC \cap DT \cap BK = K$ </answer>","Let the segments $T E$ and $T F$ cross $A C$ at $P$ and $Q$, respectively. Since $P E \| C D$ and $E D$ is tangent to the circumcircle of $A B C D$, we have

$$
\angle E P A=\angle D C A=\angle E D A
$$

and so the points $A, P, D$, and $E$ lie on some circle $\alpha$. Similarly, the points $C, Q, D$, and $F$ lie on some circle $\gamma$.

We now want to prove that the line $D T$ is tangent to both $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ at $D$. Indeed, since $\angle F C D+\angle E A D=180^{\circ}$, the circles $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are tangent to each other at $D$. To prove that $T$ lies on their common tangent line at $D$ (i.e., on their radical axis), it suffices to check that $T P \cdot T E=T Q \cdot T F$, or that the quadrilateral $P E F Q$ is cyclic. This fact follows from

$$
\angle Q F E=\angle A D E=\angle A P E .
$$

Since $T D=T K$, we have $\angle T K D=\angle T D K$. Next, as $T D$ and $D E$ are tangent to $\alpha$ and $\Omega$, respectively, we obtain

$$
\angle T K D=\angle T D K=\angle E A D=\angle B D E
$$

which implies $T K \| B D$.

Next we prove that the five points $T, P, Q, D$, and $K$ lie on some circle $\tau$. Indeed, since $T D$ is tangent to the circle $\alpha$ we have

$$
\angle E P D=\angle T D F=\angle T K D
$$

which means that the point $P$ lies on the circle (TDK). Similarly, we have $Q \in(T D K)$.

Finally, we prove that $P K \| B C$. Indeed, using the circles $\tau$ and $\gamma$ we conclude that

$$
\angle P K D=\angle P Q D=\angle D F C
$$

which means that $P K \| B C$.

Triangles $T P K$ and $D C B$ have pairwise parallel sides, which implies the fact that $T D, P C$ and $K B$ are concurrent, as desired.

Let $A B C D$ be a cyclic quadrilateral whose sides have pairwise different lengths. Let $O$ be the circumcentre of $A B C D$. The internal angle bisectors of $\angle A B C$ and $\angle A D C$ meet $A C$ at $B_{1}$ and $D_{1}$, respectively.

Similarly, let $O_{D}$ be the centre of the circle which passes through $D$ and is tangent to $A C$ at $B_{1}$.

Assume that $B D_{1} \| D B_{1}$. Prove that $O$ lies on the line $O_{B} O_{D}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions and the geometric properties of the cyclic quadrilateral and the points involved. We know that $A B C D$ is a cyclic quadrilateral with $O$ as the circumcenter. The internal angle bisectors of $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ADC$ meet $AC$ at $B_1$ and $D_1$, respectively. The points $O_B$ and $O_D$ are the centers of the circles passing through $B$ and $D$ respectively, and tangent to $AC$ at $D_1$ and $B_1$ respectively. The condition $BD_1 \| D B_1$ implies that $B_1$ and $D_1$ are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of $BD$.

Since $O$ is the circumcenter of $ABCD$, it lies on the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the quadrilateral. The perpendicular bisector of $BD$ will also be the perpendicular bisector of $B_1D_1$ because of the symmetry. This means that $O$ lies on the line $O_B O_D$.

</think>
<answer> $O$ lies on the line $O_B O_D$ </answer>","We introduce some objects and establish some preliminary facts common for all solutions below.

Let $\Omega$ denote the circle $(A B C D)$, and let $\gamma_{B}$ and $\gamma_{D}$ denote the two circles from the problem statement (their centres are $O_{B}$ and $O_{D}$, respectively). Clearly, all three centres $O, O_{B}$, and $O_{D}$ are distinct.

Assume, without loss of generality, that $A B>B C$. Suppose that $A D>D C$, and let $H=A C \cap B D$. Then the rays $B B_{1}$ and $D D_{1}$ lie on one side of $B D$, as they contain the midpoints of the arcs $A D C$ and $A B C$, respectively. However, if $B D_{1} \| D B_{1}$, then $B_{1}$ and $D_{1}$ should be separated by $H$. This contradiction shows that $A D<C D$.

Let $\gamma_{B}$ and $\gamma_{D}$ meet $\Omega$ again at $T_{B}$ and $T_{D}$, respectively. The common chord $B T_{B}$ of $\Omega$ and $\gamma_{B}$ is perpendicular to their line of

<img_3842>
centres $O_{B} O$; likewise, $D T_{D} \perp O_{D} O$. Therefore, $O \in O_{B} O_{D} \Longleftrightarrow O_{B} O\left\|O_{D} O \Longleftrightarrow B T_{B}\right\|$ $D T_{D}$, and the problem reduces to showing that

$$
B T_{B} \| D T_{D}
\tag{1}
$$


Let the diagonals $A C$ and $B D$ cross at $H$. Consider the homothety $h$ centred at $H$ and mapping $B$ to $D$. Since $B D_{1} \| D B_{1}$, we have $h\left(D_{1}\right)=B_{1}$.

Let the tangents to $\Omega$ at $B$ and $D$ meet $A C$ at $L_{B}$ and $L_{D}$, respectively. We have

$$
\angle L_{B} B B_{1}=\angle L_{B} B C+\angle C B B_{1}=\angle B A L_{B}+\angle B_{1} B A=\angle B B_{1} L_{B},
$$

which means that the triangle $L_{B} B B_{1}$ is isosceles, $L_{B} B=L_{B} B_{1}$. The powers of $L_{B}$ with respect to $\Omega$ and $\gamma_{D}$ are $L_{B} B^{2}$ and $L_{B} B_{1}^{2}$, respectively; so they are equal, whence $L_{B}$ lies on the radical axis $T_{D} D$ of those two circles. Similarly, $L_{D}$ lies on the radical axis $T_{B} B$ of $\Omega$ and $\gamma_{B}$.

By the sine rule in the triangle $B H L_{B}$, we obtain

$$
\frac{H L_{B}}{\sin \angle H B L_{B}}=\frac{B L_{B}}{\sin \angle B H L_{B}}=\frac{B_{1} L_{B}}{\sin \angle B H L_{B}}
\tag{2}
$$

similarly,

$$
\frac{H L_{D}}{\sin \angle H D L_{D}}=\frac{D L_{D}}{\sin \angle D H L_{D}}=\frac{D_{1} L_{D}}{\sin \angle D H L_{D}}
\tag{3}
$$

Clearly, $\angle B H L_{B}=\angle D H L_{D}$. In the circle $\Omega$, tangent lines $B L_{B}$ and $D L_{D}$ form equal angles with the chord $B D$, so $\sin \angle H B L_{B}=\sin \angle H D L_{D}$ (this equality does not depend on the picture). Thus, dividing (2) by (3) we get

$$
\frac{H L_{B}}{H L_{D}}=\frac{B_{1} L_{B}}{D_{1} L_{D}}, \quad \text { and hence } \quad \frac{H L_{B}}{H L_{D}}=\frac{H L_{B}-B_{1} L_{B}}{H L_{D}-D_{1} L_{D}}=\frac{H B_{1}}{H D_{1}}
$$

Since $h\left(D_{1}\right)=B_{1}$, the obtained relation yields $h\left(L_{D}\right)=L_{B}$, so $h$ maps the line $L_{D} B$ to $L_{B} D$, and these lines are parallel, as desired.

A point $D$ is chosen inside an acute-angled triangle $A B C$ with $A B>A C$ so that $\angle B A D=\angle D A C$. A point $E$ is constructed on the segment $A C$ so that $\angle A D E=\angle D C B$.

","First, let's analyze the given conditions and the structure of the problem. We have an acute-angled triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB > AC\). Point \(D\) is chosen inside the triangle such that \(\angle BAD = \angle DAC\). This implies that \(D\) lies on the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\). Point \(E\) is constructed on segment \(AC\) such that \(\angle ADE = \angle DCB\). Point \(F\) is constructed on segment \(AB\) such that \(\angle ADF = \angle DBC\). Point \(X\) is chosen on the line \(AC\) such that \(CX = BX\). We need to prove that the lines \(BC\), \(EF\), and \(O_1O_2\) are concurrent, where \(O_1\) and \(O_2\) are the circumcenters of triangles \(ADC\) and \(DXE\), respectively.

Let's start by considering the properties of the points and lines involved. Since \(D\) is on the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\), and \(E\) and \(F\) are constructed such that \(\angle ADE = \angle DCB\) and \(\angle ADF = \angle DBC\), it follows that \(D\) is the incenter of \(\triangle ABC\). This is because the angles \(\angle ADE\) and \(\angle DCB\) are equal, and \(\angle ADF\) and \(\angle DBC\) are equal, which means that \(D\) is equidistant from the sides of \(\triangle ABC\).

Next, consider the circumcenters \(O_1\) and \(O_2\). Since \(D\) is the incenter, the circumcenter \(O_1\) of \(\triangle ADC\) is the midpoint of the arc \(AC\) not containing \(B\). Similarly, the circumcenter \(O_2\) of \(\triangle DXE\) is the midpoint of the arc \(DE\) not containing \(X\). The line \(O_1O_2\) is the perpendicular bisector of the segment \(DE\).

Now, let's consider the line \(BC\). Since \(X\) is chosen such that \(CX = BX\), it means that \(X\) is the midpoint of the segment \(BC\). The line \(BC\) is a side of the triangle, and it is known that the perpendicular bisector of a side of a triangle passes through the circumcenter of the triangle. Therefore, the line \(O_1O_2\) is the perpendicular bisector of \(DE\), and it is also the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\).

Since the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle are concurrent at the circumcenter, and \(O_1O_2\) is the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\), it follows that the lines \(BC\), \(EF\), and \(O_1O_2\) are concurrent. </think>
<answer>BC, EF, and \(O_1O_2\)</answer>","Let $Q$ be the isogonal conjugate of $D$ with respect to the triangle $A B C$. Since $\angle B A D=\angle D A C$, the point $Q$ lies on $A D$. Then $\angle Q B A=\angle D B C=\angle F D A$, so the points $Q, D, F$, and $B$ are concyclic. Analogously, the points $Q, D, E$, and $C$ are concyclic. Thus $A F \cdot A B=A D \cdot A Q=A E \cdot A C$ and so the points $B, F, E$, and $C$ are also concyclic.

<img_3350>

Let $T$ be the intersection of $B C$ and $F E$.

Claim. $T D^{2}=T B \cdot T C=T F \cdot T E$.

Proof. We will prove that the circles $(D E F)$ and $(B D C)$ are tangent to each other. Indeed, using the above arguments, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \angle B D F=\angle A F D-\angle A B D=\left(180^{\circ}-\angle F A D-\angle F D A\right)-(\angle A B C-\angle D B C) \\
= & 180^{\circ}-\angle F A D-\angle A B C=180^{\circ}-\angle D A E-\angle F E A=\angle F E D+\angle A D E=\angle F E D+\angle D C B,
\end{aligned}
$$

which implies the desired tangency.

Since the points $B, C, E$, and $F$ are concyclic, the powers of the point $T$ with respect to the circles $(B D C)$ and $(E D F)$ are equal. So their radical axis, which coincides with the common tangent at $D$, passes through $T$, and hence $T D^{2}=T E \cdot T F=T B \cdot T C$.



Let $T A$ intersect the circle $(A B C)$ again at $M$. Due to the circles $(B C E F)$ and $(A M C B)$, and using the above Claim, we get $T M \cdot T A=T F \cdot T E=T B \cdot T C=T D^{2}$; in particular, the points $A, M, E$, and $F$ are concyclic.

Under the inversion with centre $T$ and radius $T D$, the point $M$ maps to $A$, and $B$ maps to $C$, which implies that the circle $(M B D)$ maps to the circle $(A D C)$. Their common point $D$ lies on the circle of the inversion, so the second intersection point $K$ also lies on that circle, which means $T K=T D$. It follows that the point $T$ and the centres of the circles $(K D E)$ and $(A D C)$ lie on the perpendicular bisector of $K D$.

Since the center of $(A D C)$ is $O_{1}$, it suffices to show now that the points $D, K, E$, and $X$ are concyclic (the center of the corresponding circle will be $O_{2}$ ).

The lines $B M, D K$, and $A C$ are the pairwise radical axes of the circles $(A B C M),(A C D K)$ and $(B M D K)$, so they are concurrent at some point $P$. Also, $M$ lies on the circle $(A E F)$, thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sphericalangle(E X, X B) & =\sphericalangle(C X, X B)=\sphericalangle(X C, B C)+\sphericalangle(B C, B X)=2 \sphericalangle(A C, C B) \\
& =\sphericalangle(A C, C B)+\sphericalangle(E F, F A)=\sphericalangle(A M, B M)+\sphericalangle(E M, M A)=\sphericalangle(E M, B M),
\end{aligned}
$$

so the points $M, E, X$, and $B$ are concyclic. Therefore, $P E \cdot P X=P M \cdot P B=P K \cdot P D$, so the points $E, K, D$, and $X$ are concyclic, as desired.

Let $\omega$ be the circumcircle of a triangle $A B C$, and let $\Omega_{A}$ be its excircle which is tangent to the segment $B C$. Let $X$ and $Y$ be the intersection points of $\omega$ and $\Omega_{A}$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be the projections of $A$ onto the tangent lines to $\Omega_{A}$ at $X$ and $Y$, respectively. The tangent line at $P$ to the circumcircle of the triangle $A P X$ intersects the tangent line at $Q$ to the circumcircle of the triangle $A Q Y$ at a point $R$. Prove that $A R \perp B C$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric properties and relationships in the problem. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with its circumcircle \(\omega\) and its excircle \(\Omega_A\) which is tangent to \(BC\). The points \(X\) and \(Y\) are the intersections of \(\omega\) and \(\Omega_A\). The projections \(P\) and \(Q\) are the points where the line through \(A\) perpendicular to the tangent at \(X\) and \(Y\) respectively, intersect the tangents to \(\Omega_A\) at \(X\) and \(Y\). The tangent line at \(P\) to the circumcircle of \(\triangle APX\) intersects the tangent line at \(Q\) to the circumcircle of \(\triangle A Q Y\) at point \(R\). We need to prove that \(AR \perp BC\).

Since \(P\) and \(Q\) are projections of \(A\) onto the tangents to \(\Omega_A\) at \(X\) and \(Y\), the lines \(AP\) and \(AQ\) are perpendicular to the tangents at \(X\) and \(Y\). The tangents at \(X\) and \(Y\) to \(\Omega_A\) are parallel to the sides of the triangle formed by the tangents at these points, and the point \(R\) is the intersection of the tangents to the circumcircles of \(\triangle APX\) and \(\triangle A Q Y\).

By the properties of the excircle and the circumcircle, the point \(R\) is the exsimilicenter of the excircle \(\Omega_A\) and the circumcircle \(\omega\). This means that \(R\) is the point where the tangents to \(\omega\) at \(X\) and \(Y\) intersect, and it is known that the exsimilicenter of an excircle and the circumcircle of a triangle is the point where the tangents to the excircle at the points of tangency with the sides of the triangle intersect. This point \(R\) is also the point where the tangents to the circumcircle of \(\triangle APX\) and \(\triangle A Q Y\) intersect, and it is perpendicular to the line \(BC\).

Thus, we have \(AR \perp BC\). </think>
<answer>AR \perp BC</answer>","Let $D$ be the point of tangency of $B C$ and $\Omega_{A}$. Let $D^{\prime}$ be the point such that $D D^{\prime}$ is a diameter of $\Omega_{A}$. Let $R^{\prime}$ be (the unique) point such that $A R^{\prime} \perp B C$ and $R^{\prime} D^{\prime} \| B C$. We shall prove that $R^{\prime}$ coincides with $R$.

Let $P X$ intersect $A B$ and $D^{\prime} R^{\prime}$ at $S$ and $T$, respectively. Let $U$ be the ideal common point of the parallel lines $B C$ and $D^{\prime} R^{\prime}$. Note that the (degenerate) hexagon $A S X T U C$ is circumscribed around $\Omega_{A}$, hence by the Brianchon theorem $A T, S U$, and $X C$ concur at a point which we denote by $V$. Then $V S \| B C$. It follows that $\sphericalangle(S V, V X)=\sphericalangle(B C, C X)=$ $\sphericalangle(B A, A X)$, hence $A X S V$ is cyclic. Therefore, $\sphericalangle(P X, X A)=\sphericalangle(S V, V A)=\sphericalangle\left(R^{\prime} T, T A\right)$. Since $\angle A P T=\angle A R^{\prime} T=90^{\circ}$, the quadrilateral $A P R^{\prime} T$ is cyclic. Hence,

$$
\sphericalangle(X A, A P)=90^{\circ}-\sphericalangle(P X, X A)=90^{\circ}-\sphericalangle\left(R^{\prime} T, T A\right)=\sphericalangle\left(T A, A R^{\prime}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(T P, P R^{\prime}\right)
$$

It follows that $P R^{\prime}$ is tangent to the circle $(A P X)$.

Analogous argument shows that $Q R^{\prime}$ is tangent to the circle $(A Q Y)$. Therefore, $R=R^{\prime}$ and $A R \perp B C$.

Let $n \geqslant 100$ be an integer. The numbers $n, n+1, \ldots, 2 n$ are written on $n+1$ cards, one number per card. The cards are shuffled and divided into two piles. Prove that one of the piles contains two cards such that the sum of their numbers is a perfect square.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the numbers on the cards: $n, n+1, \ldots, 2n$. We need to show that one of the piles contains two cards whose sum is a perfect square. Let's start by examining the possible sums of the numbers. The smallest sum we can get is $n + (n+1) = 2n + 1$, and the largest sum is $(2n-1) + 2n = 4n - 1$. We need to check if any of these sums are perfect squares. </think>

$$
(a, b, c)=\left(2 k^{2}-4 k, \quad 2 k^{2}+1, \quad 2 k^{2}+4 k\right)

For $k \geqslant 9$ the intervals $I_{k}$ and $I_{k+1}$ overlap because

Hence $I_{9} \cup I_{10} \cup \ldots=[99, \infty)$, which proves the statement for $n \geqslant 99$.",0,False,144

Prove that there are only finitely many quadruples $(a, b, c, n)$ of positive integers such that

$$
n !=a^{n-1}+b^{n-1}+c^{n-1} .
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the equation we need to work with: \( n \neq a^{n-1} + b^{n-1} + c^{n-1} \). We need to show that there are only finitely many quadruples \((a, b, c, n)\) that satisfy this equation. 

One way to approach this is to consider the growth rates of the terms \(a^{n-1}\), \(b^{n-1}\), and \(c^{n-1}\). As \(n\) increases, the terms \(a^{n-1}\), \(b^{n-1}\), and \(c^{n-1}\) grow very quickly. If we can find a way to bound the sum of these terms, we might be able to limit the possible values of \(n\).

Let's start by considering the case when \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are small positive integers. If we take \(a = b = c = 1\), then the equation becomes \(n \neq 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\). This is true for all \(n \neq 3\). 

Now, let's consider the case when \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are larger. If we take \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 2\), then the equation becomes \(n \neq 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1} = 3 \cdot 2^{n-1}\). This is true for all \(n \neq 3\). 

If we take \(a = 2\), \(b = 3\), and \(c = 4\), then the equation becomes \(n \neq 2^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} + 4^{n-1}\). The terms \(2^{n-1}\), \(3^{n-1}\), and \(4^{n-1}\) grow very quickly, and their sum will be much larger than \(n\) for large \(n\). </think>
<answer> (a, b, c, n) = (1, 1, 1, k) \text{ for } k \neq 3 </answer>","For fixed $n$ there are clearly finitely many solutions; we will show that there is no solution with $n>100$. So, assume $n>100$. By the AM-GM inequality,

$$
\begin{aligned}
n ! & =2 n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) \cdot(3 \cdot 4 \cdots(n-4)) \\
& \leqslant 2(n-1)^{4}\left(\frac{3+\cdots+(n-4)}{n-6}\right)^{n-6}=2(n-1)^{4}\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right)^{n-6}<\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right)^{n-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

thus $a, b, c<(n-1) / 2$.

For every prime $p$ and integer $m \neq 0$, let $\nu_{p}(m)$ denote the $p$-adic valuation of $m$; that is, the greatest non-negative integer $k$ for which $p^{k}$ divides $m$. Legendre's formula states that

$$
\nu_{p}(n !)=\sum_{s=1}^{\infty}\left\lfloor\frac{n}{p^{s}}\right\rfloor
$$

and a well-know corollary of this formula is that

$$
\nu_{p}(n !)<\sum_{s=1}^{\infty} \frac{n}{p^{s}}=\frac{n}{p-1}
\tag{1}
$$

If $n$ is odd then $a^{n-1}, b^{n-1}, c^{n-1}$ are squares, and by considering them modulo 4 we conclude that $a, b$ and $c$ must be even. Hence, $2^{n-1} \mid n$ ! but that is impossible for odd $n$ because $\nu_{2}(n !)=\nu_{2}((n-1) !)<n-1$ by $(1)$.

From now on we assume that $n$ is even. If all three numbers $a+b, b+c, c+a$ are powers of 2 then $a, b, c$ have the same parity. If they all are odd, then $n !=a^{n-1}+b^{n-1}+c^{n-1}$ is also odd which is absurd. If all $a, b, c$ are divisible by 4 , this contradicts $\nu_{2}(n !) \leqslant n-1$. If, say, $a$ is not divisible by 4 , then $2 a=(a+b)+(a+c)-(b+c)$ is not divisible by 8 , and since all $a+b, b+c$, $c+a$ are powers of 2 , we get that one of these sums equals 4 , so two of the numbers of $a, b, c$ are equal to 2. Say, $a=b=2$, then $c=2^{r}-2$ and, since $c \mid n$ !, we must have $c \mid a^{n-1}+b^{n-1}=2^{n}$ implying $r=2$, and so $c=2$, which is impossible because $n ! \equiv 0 \not \equiv 3 \cdot 2^{n-1}(\bmod 5)$.

So now we assume that the sum of two numbers among $a, b, c$, say $a+b$, is not a power of 2 , so it is divisible by some odd prime $p$. Then $p \leqslant a+b<n$ and so $c^{n-1}=n !-\left(a^{n-1}+b^{n-1}\right)$ is divisible by $p$. If $p$ divides $a$ and $b$, we get $p^{n-1} \mid n$ !, contradicting (1)$. Next, using (1) and the Lifting the Exponent Lemma we get

$$
\nu_{p}(1)+\nu_{p}(2)+\cdots+\nu_{p}(n)=\nu_{p}(n !)=\nu_{p}\left(n !-c^{n-1}\right)=\nu_{p}\left(a^{n-1}+b^{n-1}\right)=\nu_{p}(a+b)+\nu_{p}(n-1)
\tag{2}
$$

In view of (2), no number of $1,2, \ldots, n$ can be divisible by $p$, except $a+b$ and $n-1>a+b$. On the other hand, $p \mid c$ implies that $p<n / 2$ and so there must be at least two such numbers. Hence, there are two multiples of $p$ among $1,2, \ldots, n$, namely $a+b=p$ and $n-1=2 p$. But this is another contradiction because $n-1$ is odd. This final contradiction shows that there is no solution of the equation for $n>100$.",0,False,506

Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers such that $a_{n+2 m}$ divides $a_{n}+a_{n+m}$ for all positive integers $n$ and $m$. Prove that this sequence is eventually periodic, i.e. there exist positive integers $N$ and $d$ such that $a_{n}=a_{n+d}$ for all $n>N$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: $a_{n+2m}$ divides $a_{n} + a_{n+m}$ for all positive integers $n$ and $m$. We need to show that the sequence is eventually periodic. 

To start, let's consider the case when $m=1$. The condition becomes $a_{n+2}$ divides $a_{n} + a_{n+1}$. This means that $a_{n+2}$ is a divisor of the sum of the previous two terms. 

Next, let's consider the case when $m=2$. The condition becomes $a_{n+4}$ divides $a_{n} + a_{n+2}$. This means that $a_{n+4}$ is a divisor of the sum of the terms two steps ahead and the term two steps behind. 

Now, let's think about the implications of these conditions. If we can find a pattern or a cycle in the sequence, it will be periodic. 

One way to approach this is to consider the possibility that the sequence might be a linear recurrence relation. If we assume that the sequence is of the form $a_n = r^n$ for some integer $r$, then the condition $a_{n+2m} \mid a_n + a_{n+m}$ would be satisfied if $r^{n+2m} \mid r^n + r^{n+m}$. This simplifies to $r^{2m} \mid r^m + 1$, which is true if $r=1$ or $r=-1$ (but since we are dealing with positive integers, $r=1$). 

If $a_n = 1$ for all $n$, then the sequence is trivially periodic with period 1. If $a_n = k$ for some constant $k$, then the sequence is also periodic with period 1. 

</think>
<answer> The sequence is eventually periodic. </answer>","We will make repeated use of the following simple observation:

Lemma 1. If a positive integer $d$ divides $a_{n}$ and $a_{n-m}$ for some $m$ and $n>2 m$, it also divides $a_{n-2 m}$. If $d$ divides $a_{n}$ and $a_{n-2 m}$, it also divides $a_{n-m}$.

Proof. Both parts are obvious since $a_{n}$ divides $a_{n-2 m}+a_{n-m}$.

Claim. The sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)$ is bounded.

Proof. Suppose the contrary. Then there exist infinitely many indices $n$ such that $a_{n}$ is greater than each of the previous terms $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n-1}$. Let $a_{n}=k$ be such a term, $n>10$. For each $s<\frac{n}{2}$ the number $a_{n}=k$ divides $a_{n-s}+a_{n-2 s}<2 k$, therefore

$$
a_{n-s}+a_{n-2 s}=k \text {. }
$$

In particular,

$$
a_{n}=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}=a_{n-2}+a_{n-4}=a_{n-4}+a_{n-8}
$$

that is, $a_{n-1}=a_{n-4}$ and $a_{n-2}=a_{n-8}$. It follows from Lemma 1 that $a_{n-1}$ divides $a_{n-1-3 s}$ for $3 s<n-1$ and $a_{n-2}$ divides $a_{n-2-6 s}$ for $6 s<n-2$. Since at least one of the numbers $a_{n-1}$ and $a_{n-2}$ is at least $a_{n} / 2$, so is some $a_{i}$ with $i \leqslant 6$. However, $a_{n}$ can be arbitrarily large, a contradiction.

Since $\left(a_{n}\right)$ is bounded, there exist only finitely many $i$ for which $a_{i}$ appears in the sequence finitely many times. In other words, there exists $N$ such that if $a_{i}=t$ and $i>N$, then $a_{j}=t$ for infinitely many $j$.

Clearly the sequence $\left(a_{n+N}\right)_{n>0}$ satisfies the divisibility condition, and it is enough to prove that this sequence is eventually periodic. Thus truncating the sequence if necessary, we can assume that each number appears infinitely many times in the sequence. Let $k$ be the maximum number appearing in the sequence.

Lemma 2. If a positive integer $d$ divides $a_{n}$ for some $n$, then the numbers $i$ such that $d$ divides $a_{i}$ form an arithmetical progression with an odd difference.

Proof. Let $i_{1}<i_{2}<i_{3}<\ldots$ be all the indices $i$ such that $d$ divides $a_{i}$. If $i_{s}+i_{s+1}$ is even, it follows from Lemma 1 that $d$ also divides $\frac{a_{i_{s}+i_{s+1}}^{2}}{}$, impossible since $i_{s}<\frac{i_{s}+i_{s+1}}{2}<i_{s+1}$. Thus $i_{s}$ and $i_{s+1}$ are always of different parity, and therefore $i_{s}+i_{s+2}$ is even. Applying Lemma 1 again, we see that $d$ divides $\frac{a_{i_{s}+i_{s+2}}}{2}$, hence $\frac{i_{s}+i_{s+2}}{2}=i_{s+1}$,

We are ready now to solve the problem.

The number of positive divisors of all terms of the progression is finite. Let $d_{s}$ be the difference of the progression corresponding to $s$, that is, $s$ divides $a_{n}$ if and only if it divides $a_{n+t d_{s}}$ for any positive integer $t$. Let $D$ be the product of all $d_{s}$. Then each $s$ dividing a term of the progression divides $a_{n}$ if and only if it divides $a_{n+D}$. This means that the sets of divisors of $a_{n}$ and $a_{n+D}$ coincide, and $a_{n+D}=a_{n}$. Thus $D$ is a period of the sequence.",0,False,414

Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}, k$, and $M$ be positive integers such that

$$
\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}=k \quad \text { and } \quad a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}=M
$$

If $M>1$, prove that the polynomial

$$
P(x)=M(x+1)^{k}-\left(x+a_{1}\right)\left(x+a_{2}\right) \cdots\left(x+a_{n}\right)
$$

has no positive roots.

","First, let's consider the polynomial \( P(x) = M(x+1)^k - (x+a_1)(x+a_2) \cdots (x+a_n) \). We need to show that this polynomial has no positive roots. 

Given that \( \frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{a_n} = k \) and \( a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n = M \), we can infer that the sum of the reciprocals of the \( a_i \)'s equals the integer \( k \). This means that the sum of the reciprocals is an integer, and since \( k \) is an integer, the sum of the reciprocals being an integer is consistent with the given conditions.

Now, let's analyze the polynomial \( P(x) \). We need to check if there is any positive \( x \) such that \( P(x) = 0 \). This would mean:

\[
M(x+1)^k = (x+a_1)(x+a_2) \cdots (x+a_n)
\]

Let's consider the behavior of the polynomial at \( x = 0 \):

\[
P(0) = M(0+1)^k - (0+a_1)(0+a_2) \cdots (0+a_n) = M - M = 0
\]

So, \( x = 0 \) is a root of the polynomial. However, we need to check if there are any other positive roots. 

Since \( M > 1 \) and the polynomial is of degree \( k + n \), and considering the structure of the polynomial, it is clear that the polynomial will not have any other positive roots. This is because the term \( M(x+1)^k \) grows much faster than the product \( (x+a_1)(x+a_2) \cdots (x+a_n) \) for positive \( x \). </think>
<answer> (x+1)^k = (x+a_1)(x+a_2) \cdots (x+a_n) </answer>","We first prove that, for $x>0$,

$$
a_{i}(x+1)^{1 / a_{i}} \leqslant x+a_{i}
\tag{1}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{i}=1$. It is clear that equality occurs if $a_{i}=1$.

If $a_{i}>1$, the AM-GM inequality applied to a single copy of $x+1$ and $a_{i}-1$ copies of 1 yields

$$
\frac{(x+1)+\overbrace{1+1+\cdots+1}^{a_{i}-1 \text { ones }}}{a_{i}} \geqslant \sqrt[a_{i}]{(x+1) \cdot 1^{a_{i}-1}} \Longrightarrow a_{i}(x+1)^{1 / a_{i}} \leqslant x+a_{i} .
$$

Since $x+1>1$, the inequality is strict for $a_{i}>1$.

Multiplying the inequalities (1) for $i=1,2, \ldots, n$ yields

$$
\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}(x+1)^{1 / a_{i}} \leqslant \prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(x+a_{i}\right) \Longleftrightarrow M(x+1)^{\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 / a_{i}}-\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(x+a_{i}\right) \leqslant 0 \Longleftrightarrow P(x) \leqslant 0
$$

with equality iff $a_{i}=1$ for all $i \in\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$. But this implies $M=1$, which is not possible. Hence $P(x)<0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$, and $P$ has no positive roots.",0,False,463

Let $S$ be a finite set, and let $\mathcal{A}$ be the set of all functions from $S$ to $S$. Let $f$ be an element of $\mathcal{A}$, and let $T=f(S)$ be the image of $S$ under $f$. Suppose that $f \circ g \circ f \neq g \circ f \circ g$ for every $g$ in $\mathcal{A}$ with $g \neq f$. Show that $f(T)=T$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: for any function $g \in \mathcal{A}$ with $g \neq f$, the composition $f \circ g \circ f \neq g \circ f \circ g$. This implies that the function $f$ does not commute with all other functions in $\mathcal{A}$, except for itself. 

Now, let's analyze the image of $S$ under $f$, which is $T = f(S)$. We need to show that $f(T) = T$. 

Since $f$ is a function from $S$ to $S$, and $T = f(S)$, it means that $T$ is a subset of $S$. We need to show that $f(T) = T$. 

Consider any element $t \in T$. By definition, $t = f(s)$ for some $s \in S$. Applying $f$ to $t$, we get $f(t) = f(f(s))$. Since $f$ is a function from $S$ to $S$, $f(f(s))$ is also in $S$. This means that $f(t) \in T$. 

Conversely, if $t \in T$, then $t = f(s)$ for some $s \in S$, and $f(t) = f(f(s))$. Since $f$ is a function, $f(f(s))$ is in $S$, and thus $f(t) \in T$. 

Therefore, $f(T) = T$. </think>
<answer> $$f(T) = T$$ </answer>","For $n \geqslant 1$, denote the $n$-th composition of $f$ with itself by

$$
f^{n} \stackrel{\text { def }}{=} \underbrace{f \circ f \circ \cdots \circ f}_{n \text { times }}
$$

By hypothesis, if $g \in \mathcal{A}$ satisfies $f \circ g \circ f=g \circ f \circ g$, then $g=f$. A natural idea is to try to plug in $g=f^{n}$ for some $n$ in the expression $f \circ g \circ f=g \circ f \circ g$ in order to get $f^{n}=f$, which solves the problem:

Claim. If there exists $n \geqslant 3$ such that $f^{n+2}=f^{2 n+1}$, then the restriction $f: T \rightarrow T$ of $f$ to $T$ is a bijection.

Proof. Indeed, by hypothesis, $f^{n+2}=f^{2 n+1} \Longleftrightarrow f \circ f^{n} \circ f=f^{n} \circ f \circ f^{n} \Longrightarrow f^{n}=f$. Since $n-2 \geqslant 1$, the image of $f^{n-2}$ is contained in $T=f(S)$, hence $f^{n-2}$ restricts to a function $f^{n-2}: T \rightarrow T$. This is the inverse of $f: T \rightarrow T$. In fact, given $t \in T$, say $t=f(s)$ with $s \in S$, we have

$$
t=f(s)=f^{n}(s)=f^{n-2}(f(t))=f\left(f^{n-2}(t)\right), \quad \text { i.e., } \quad f^{n-2} \circ f=f \circ f^{n-2}=\mathrm{id} \text { on } T
$$

(here id stands for the identity function). Hence, the restriction $f: T \rightarrow T$ of $f$ to $T$ is bijective with inverse given by $f^{n-2}: T \rightarrow T$.

It remains to show that $n$ as in the claim exists. For that, define

$$
S_{m} \stackrel{\text { def }}{=} f^{m}(S) \quad\left(S_{m} \text { is image of } f^{m}\right)
$$

Clearly the image of $f^{m+1}$ is contained in the image of $f^{m}$, i.e., there is a descending chain of subsets of $S$

$$
S \supseteq S_{1} \supseteq S_{2} \supseteq S_{3} \supseteq S_{4} \supseteq \cdots,
$$

which must eventually stabilise since $S$ is finite, i.e., there is a $k \geqslant 1$ such that

$$
S_{k}=S_{k+1}=S_{k+2}=S_{k+3}=\cdots \stackrel{\text { def }}{=} S_{\infty}
$$

Hence $f$ restricts to a surjective function $f: S_{\infty} \rightarrow S_{\infty}$, which is also bijective since $S_{\infty} \subseteq S$ is finite. To sum up, $f: S_{\infty} \rightarrow S_{\infty}$ is a permutation of the elements of the finite set $S_{\infty}$, hence there exists an integer $r \geqslant 1$ such that $f^{r}=\mathrm{id}$ on $S_{\infty}$ (for example, we may choose $r=\left|S_{\infty}\right|$ !). In other words,

$$
f^{m+r}=f^{m} \text { on } S \text { for all } m \geqslant k \text {. }
\tag{*}
$$

Clearly, $(*)$ also implies that $f^{m+t r}=f^{m}$ for all integers $t \geqslant 1$ and $m \geqslant k$. So, to find $n$ as in the claim and finish the problem, it is enough to choose $m$ and $t$ in order to ensure that there exists $n \geqslant 3$ satisfying

$$
\left\{\begin{array} { l } 
{ 2 n + 1 = m + t r } \\
{ n + 2 = m }
\end{array} \Longleftrightarrow \left\{\begin{array}{l}
m=3+t r \\
n=m-2
\end{array}\right.\right.
$$

This can be clearly done by choosing $m$ large enough with $m \equiv 3(\bmod r)$. For instance, we may take $n=2 k r+1$, so that

$$
f^{n+2}=f^{2 k r+3}=f^{4 k r+3}=f^{2 n+1}
$$

where the middle equality follows by $(*)$ since $2 k r+3 \geqslant k$.",0,False,342

A sequence of real numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots$ satisfies the relation

$$
a_{n}=-\max _{i+j=n}\left(a_{i}+a_{j}\right) \quad \text { for all } n>2017
$$

Prove that this sequence is bounded, i.e., there is a constant $M$ such that $\left|a_{n}\right| \leqslant M$ for all positive integers $n$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given relation: \(a_n = -\max_{i+j=n} (a_i + a_j)\). This means that for each \(n > 2017\), the value of \(a_n\) is the negative of the maximum value of the sum of two previous terms, \(a_i + a_j\), where \(i + j = n\).

To prove that the sequence is bounded, we need to show that there exists a constant \(M\) such that \(|a_n| \leq M\) for all \(n\). Let's start by considering the possible values of \(a_n\).

If we assume that the sequence is unbounded, then there would be some \(n\) for which \(|a_n|\) is arbitrarily large. However, the relation \(a_n = -\max_{i+j=n} (a_i + a_j)\) suggests that the value of \(a_n\) is determined by the maximum of the sums of previous terms. This implies that the values of \(a_n\) are constrained by the values of the previous terms.

Let's consider the possibility that the sequence is bounded by a constant \(M\). If we assume that \(|a_n| \leq M\) for all \(n\), then the maximum value of \(a_i + a_j\) for any \(i + j = n\) would also be bounded by \(2M\). This is because the sum of two numbers each bounded by \(M\) is bounded by \(2M\).

Given the relation, if the maximum of \(a_i + a_j\) is bounded by \(2M\), then \(-\max_{i+j=n} (a_i + a_j)\) would be bounded by \(-2M\). This means that \(a_n\) is bounded by \(-2M\), which is consistent with our assumption that \(|a_n| \leq M\).

</think>
<answer> |a_n| \leq 2M \text{ for all } n > 2017 </answer>","Set $D=2017$. Denote

$$
M_{n}=\max _{k<n} a_{k} \quad \text { and } \quad m_{n}=-\min _{k<n} a_{k}=\max _{k<n}\left(-a_{k}\right)
$$

Clearly, the sequences $\left(m_{n}\right)$ and $\left(M_{n}\right)$ are nondecreasing. We need to prove that both are bounded.

Consider an arbitrary $n>D$; our first aim is to bound $a_{n}$ in terms of $m_{n}$ and $M_{n}$.

(i) There exist indices $p$ and $q$ such that $a_{n}=-\left(a_{p}+a_{q}\right)$ and $p+q=n$. Since $a_{p}, a_{q} \leqslant M_{n}$, we have $a_{n} \geqslant-2 M_{n}$.

(ii) On the other hand, choose an index $k<n$ such that $a_{k}=M_{n}$. Then, we have

$$
a_{n}=-\max _{\ell<n}\left(a_{n-\ell}+a_{\ell}\right) \leqslant-\left(a_{n-k}+a_{k}\right)=-a_{n-k}-M_{n} \leqslant m_{n}-M_{n} .
$$

Summarizing (i) and (ii), we get

$$
-2 M_{n} \leqslant a_{n} \leqslant m_{n}-M_{n}
$$

whence

$$
m_{n} \leqslant m_{n+1} \leqslant \max \left\{m_{n}, 2 M_{n}\right\} \quad \text { and } \quad M_{n} \leqslant M_{n+1} \leqslant \max \left\{M_{n}, m_{n}-M_{n}\right\}
\tag{1}
$$

Now, say that an index $n>D$ is lucky if $m_{n} \leqslant 2 M_{n}$. Two cases are possible.

Case 1. Assume that there exists a lucky index $n$. In this case, (1) yields $m_{n+1} \leqslant 2 M_{n}$ and $M_{n} \leqslant M_{n+1} \leqslant M_{n}$. Therefore, $M_{n+1}=M_{n}$ and $m_{n+1} \leqslant 2 M_{n}=2 M_{n+1}$. So, the index $n+1$ is also lucky, and $M_{n+1}=M_{n}$. Applying the same arguments repeatedly, we obtain that all indices $k>n$ are lucky (i.e., $m_{k} \leqslant 2 M_{k}$ for all these indices), and $M_{k}=M_{n}$ for all such indices. Thus, all of the $m_{k}$ and $M_{k}$ are bounded by $2 M_{n}$.

Case 2. Assume now that there is no lucky index, i.e., $2 M_{n}<m_{n}$ for all $n>D$. Then (1) shows that for all $n>D$ we have $m_{n} \leqslant m_{n+1} \leqslant m_{n}$, so $m_{n}=m_{D+1}$ for all $n>D$. Since $M_{n}<m_{n} / 2$ for all such indices, all of the $m_{n}$ and $M_{n}$ are bounded by $m_{D+1}$.

Thus, in both cases the sequences $\left(m_{n}\right)$ and $\left(M_{n}\right)$ are bounded, as desired.",0,False,437

Let $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots$ be a sequence of integers and $b_{0}, b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots$ be a sequence of positive integers such that $a_{0}=0, a_{1}=1$, and

$$
a_{n+1}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
a_{n} b_{n}+a_{n-1}, & \text { if } b_{n-1}=1 \\
a_{n} b_{n}-a_{n-1}, & \text { if } b_{n-1}>1

Prove that at least one of the two numbers $a_{2017}$ and $a_{2018}$ must be greater than or equal to 2017 .
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given recurrence relation and the initial conditions. We have $a_0 = 0$ and $a_1 = 1$. The recurrence relation is defined as follows:
- If $b_{n-1} = 1$, then $a_{n+1} = a_n b_n + a_{n-1}$.
- If $b_{n-1} > 1$, then $a_{n+1} = a_n b_n - a_{n-1}$.

We need to show that at least one of $a_{2017}$ or $a_{2018}$ is at least 2017. Let's start by examining the first few terms to see if we can identify a pattern.

For $n=1$, we have $b_0 = 1$ (since $b_0$ is the first term), so $a_2 = a_1 b_1 + a_0 = 1 \cdot 1 + 0 = 1$.
For $n=2$, we have $b_1 = 1$, so $a_3 = a_2 b_2 + a_1 = 1 \cdot 1 + 1 = 2$.
For $n=3$, we have $b_2 = 1$, so $a_4 = a_3 b_3 + a_2 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.
For $n=4$, we have $b_3 = 1$, so $a_5 = a_4 b_4 + a_3 = 3 \cdot 1 + 2 = 5$.
For $n=5$, we have $b_4 = 1$, so $a_6 = a_5 b_5 + a_4 = 5 \cdot 1 + 3 = 8$.
For $n=6$, we have $b_5 = 1$, so $a_7 = a_6 b_6 + a_5 = 8 \cdot 1 + 5 = 13$.
For $n=7$, we have $b_6 = 1$, so $a_8 = a_7 b_7 + a_6 = 13 \cdot 1 + 8 = 21$.

We can see that the sequence is growing, and the terms are increasing. To prove that at least one of $a_{2017}$ or $a_{2018}$ is at least 2017, we need to consider the growth rate. The sequence is increasing by a factor of $b_n$ when $b_n = 1$, and by a factor of $b_n$ minus a constant when $b_n > 1$. Since $b_n$ is a positive integer, the sequence will continue to grow, and the terms will eventually exceed 2017. </think>
<answer> a_{2017} \geq 2017 \text{ or } a_{2018} \geq 2017 </answer>","The value of $b_{0}$ is irrelevant since $a_{0}=0$, so we may assume that $b_{0}=1$.

Lemma. We have $a_{n} \geqslant 1$ for all $n \geqslant 1$.

Proof. Let us suppose otherwise in order to obtain a contradiction. Let

$$
n \geqslant 1 \text { be the smallest integer with } a_{n} \leqslant 0 \text {. }
\tag{1}
$$

Note that $n \geqslant 2$. It follows that $a_{n-1} \geqslant 1$ and $a_{n-2} \geqslant 0$. Thus we cannot have $a_{n}=$ $a_{n-1} b_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$, so we must have $a_{n}=a_{n-1} b_{n-1}-a_{n-2}$. Since $a_{n} \leqslant 0$, we have $a_{n-1} \leqslant a_{n-2}$. Thus we have $a_{n-2} \geqslant a_{n-1} \geqslant a_{n}$.

Let

$$
r \text { be the smallest index with } a_{r} \geqslant a_{r+1} \geqslant a_{r+2} \text {. }
\tag{2}
$$

Then $r \leqslant n-2$ by the above, but also $r \geqslant 2$ : if $b_{1}=1$, then $a_{2}=a_{1}=1$ and $a_{3}=a_{2} b_{2}+a_{1}>a_{2}$; if $b_{1}>1$, then $a_{2}=b_{1}>1=a_{1}$.

By the minimal choice (2) of $r$, it follows that $a_{r-1}<a_{r}$. And since $2 \leqslant r \leqslant n-2$, by the minimal choice (1) of $n$ we have $a_{r-1}, a_{r}, a_{r+1}>0$. In order to have $a_{r+1} \geqslant a_{r+2}$, we must have $a_{r+2}=a_{r+1} b_{r+1}-a_{r}$ so that $b_{r} \geqslant 2$. Putting everything together, we conclude that

$$
a_{r+1}=a_{r} b_{r} \pm a_{r-1} \geqslant 2 a_{r}-a_{r-1}=a_{r}+\left(a_{r}-a_{r-1}\right)>a_{r},
$$

which contradicts (2).

To complete the problem, we prove that $\max \left\{a_{n}, a_{n+1}\right\} \geqslant n$ by induction. The cases $n=0,1$ are given. Assume it is true for all non-negative integers strictly less than $n$, where $n \geqslant 2$. There are two cases:

Case 1: $b_{n-1}=1$.

Then $a_{n+1}=a_{n} b_{n}+a_{n-1}$. By the inductive assumption one of $a_{n-1}, a_{n}$ is at least $n-1$ and the other, by the lemma, is at least 1 . Hence

$$
a_{n+1}=a_{n} b_{n}+a_{n-1} \geqslant a_{n}+a_{n-1} \geqslant(n-1)+1=n .
$$

Thus $\max \left\{a_{n}, a_{n+1}\right\} \geqslant n$, as desired.

Case 2: $b_{n-1}>1$.

Since we defined $b_{0}=1$ there is an index $r$ with $1 \leqslant r \leqslant n-1$ such that

$$
b_{n-1}, b_{n-2}, \ldots, b_{r} \geqslant 2 \quad \text { and } \quad b_{r-1}=1
$$

We have $a_{r+1}=a_{r} b_{r}+a_{r-1} \geqslant 2 a_{r}+a_{r-1}$. Thus $a_{r+1}-a_{r} \geqslant a_{r}+a_{r-1}$.

Now we claim that $a_{r}+a_{r-1} \geqslant r$. Indeed, this holds by inspection for $r=1$; for $r \geqslant 2$, one of $a_{r}, a_{r-1}$ is at least $r-1$ by the inductive assumption, while the other, by the lemma, is at least 1 . Hence $a_{r}+a_{r-1} \geqslant r$, as claimed, and therefore $a_{r+1}-a_{r} \geqslant r$ by the last inequality in the previous paragraph.

Since $r \geqslant 1$ and, by the lemma, $a_{r} \geqslant 1$, from $a_{r+1}-a_{r} \geqslant r$ we get the following two inequalities:

$$
a_{r+1} \geqslant r+1 \quad \text { and } \quad a_{r+1}>a_{r} \text {. }
$$



Now observe that

$$
a_{m}>a_{m-1} \Longrightarrow a_{m+1}>a_{m} \text { for } m=r+1, r+2, \ldots, n-1
$$

since $a_{m+1}=a_{m} b_{m}-a_{m-1} \geqslant 2 a_{m}-a_{m-1}=a_{m}+\left(a_{m}-a_{m-1}\right)>a_{m}$. Thus

$$
a_{n}>a_{n-1}>\cdots>a_{r+1} \geqslant r+1 \Longrightarrow a_{n} \geqslant n .
$$

So $\max \left\{a_{n}, a_{n+1}\right\} \geqslant n$, as desired.",0,False,675

Assume that a function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfies the following condition:

For every $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(f(x)+y)(f(y)+x)>0$, we have $f(x)+y=f(y)+x$.

Prove that $f(x)+y \leqslant f(y)+x$ whenever $x>y$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given condition: for every $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(f(x)+y)(f(y)+x)>0$, we have $f(x)+y=f(y)+x$. This implies that if the product $(f(x)+y)(f(y)+x)$ is positive, then $f(x)+y$ must equal $f(y)+x$. 

Now, let's consider the case when $x > y$. We need to show that $f(x) + y \leq f(y) + x$. 

If we assume that $f(x) + y > f(y) + x$, then we would have $(f(x) + y) - (f(y) + x) > 0$. This would mean that $(f(x) - f(y)) + (y - x) > 0$. 

However, from the given condition, if $(f(x) + y)(f(y) + x) > 0$, then $f(x) + y = f(y) + x$. This directly contradicts our assumption that $f(x) + y > f(y) + x$. 

Therefore, it must be that $f(x) + y \leq f(y) + x$ whenever $x > y$.
</think>
<answer> f(x) + y \leq f(y) + x </answer>","Define $g(x)=x-f(x)$. The condition on $f$ then rewrites as follows:

For every $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $((x+y)-g(x))((x+y)-g(y))>0$, we have $g(x)=g(y)$.

This condition may in turn be rewritten in the following form:
$$
\text{If }g(x) \neq g(y)\text{, then the number x+y lies (non-strictly)}\text{ between }g(x)\text{ and }g(y).  
\tag{*}
$$
Notice here that the function $g_{1}(x)=-g(-x)$ also satisfies $(*)$, since

$$
\begin{gathered}
g_{1}(x) \neq g_{1}(y) \Longrightarrow \quad g(-x) \neq g(-y) \Longrightarrow \quad-(x+y) \text { lies between } g(-x) \text { and } g(-y) \\
\Longrightarrow \quad x+y \text { lies between } g_{1}(x) \text { and } g_{1}(y) .
\end{gathered}
$$

On the other hand, the relation we need to prove reads now as

$$
g(x) \leqslant g(y) \quad \text { whenever } x<y
\tag{1}
$$

Again, this condition is equivalent to the same one with $g$ replaced by $g_{1}$.

If $g(x)=2 x$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$, then $(*)$ is obvious; so in what follows we consider the other case. We split the solution into a sequence of lemmas, strengthening one another. We always consider some value of $x$ with $g(x) \neq 2 x$ and denote $X=g(x)$.

Lemma 1. Assume that $X<2 x$. Then on the interval $(X-x ; x]$ the function $g$ attains at most two values - namely, $X$ and, possibly, some $Y>X$. Similarly, if $X>2 x$, then $g$ attains at most two values on $[x ; X-x)$ - namely, $X$ and, possibly, some $Y<X$.

Proof. We start with the first claim of the lemma. Notice that $X-x<x$, so the considered interval is nonempty.

Take any $a \in(X-x ; x)$ with $g(a) \neq X$ (if it exists). If $g(a)<X$, then (*) yields $g(a) \leqslant$ $a+x \leqslant g(x)=X$, so $a \leqslant X-x$ which is impossible. Thus, $g(a)>X$ and hence by $(*)$ we get $X \leqslant a+x \leqslant g(a)$.

Now, for any $b \in(X-x ; x)$ with $g(b) \neq X$ we similarly get $b+x \leqslant g(b)$. Therefore, the number $a+b$ (which is smaller than each of $a+x$ and $b+x$ ) cannot lie between $g(a)$ and $g(b)$, which by $(*)$ implies that $g(a)=g(b)$. Hence $g$ may attain only two values on $(X-x ; x]$, namely $X$ and $g(a)>X$.

To prove the second claim, notice that $g_{1}(-x)=-X<2 \cdot(-x)$, so $g_{1}$ attains at most two values on $(-X+x,-x]$, i.e., $-X$ and, possibly, some $-Y>-X$. Passing back to $g$, we get what we need.

Lemma 2. If $X<2 x$, then $g$ is constant on $(X-x ; x)$. Similarly, if $X>2 x$, then $g$ is constant on $(x ; X-x)$.

Proof. Again, it suffices to prove the first claim only. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exist $a, b \in(X-x ; x)$ with $g(a) \neq g(b)$; by Lemma 1 , we may assume that $g(a)=X$ and $Y=g(b)>X$.

Notice that $\min \{X-a, X-b\}>X-x$, so there exists a $u \in(X-x ; x)$ such that $u<\min \{X-a, X-b\}$. By Lemma 1, we have either $g(u)=X$ or $g(u)=Y$. In the former case, by (*) we have $X \leqslant u+b \leqslant Y$ which contradicts $u<X-b$. In the second case, by (*) we have $X \leqslant u+a \leqslant Y$ which contradicts $u<X-a$. Thus the lemma is proved.



Lemma 3. If $X<2 x$, then $g(a)=X$ for all $a \in(X-x ; x)$. Similarly, if $X>2 x$, then $g(a)=X$ for all $a \in(x ; X-x)$.

Proof. Again, we only prove the first claim.

By Lemmas 1 and 2, this claim may be violated only if $g$ takes on a constant value $Y>X$ on $(X-x, x)$. Choose any $a, b \in(X-x ; x)$ with $a<b$. By $(*)$, we have

$$
Y \geqslant b+x \geqslant X
\tag{2}
$$

In particular, we have $Y \geqslant b+x>2 a$. Applying Lemma 2 to $a$ in place of $x$, we obtain that $g$ is constant on $(a, Y-a)$. By (2) again, we have $x \leqslant Y-b<Y-a$; so $x, b \in(a ; Y-a)$. But $X=g(x) \neq g(b)=Y$, which is a contradiction.

Now we are able to finish the solution. Assume that $g(x)>g(y)$ for some $x<y$. Denote $X=g(x)$ and $Y=g(y)$; by $(*)$, we have $X \geqslant x+y \geqslant Y$, so $Y-y \leqslant x<y \leqslant X-x$, and hence $(Y-y ; y) \cap(x ; X-x)=(x, y) \neq \varnothing$. On the other hand, since $Y-y<y$ and $x<X-x$, Lemma 3 shows that $g$ should attain a constant value $X$ on $(x ; X-x)$ and a constant value $Y \neq X$ on $(Y-y ; y)$. Since these intervals overlap, we get the final contradiction.",0,False,293

A rectangle $\mathcal{R}$ with odd integer side lengths is divided into small rectangles with integer side lengths. Prove that there is at least one among the small rectangles whose distances from the four sides of $\mathcal{R}$ are either all odd or all even.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the original rectangle $\mathcal{R}$ with odd integer side lengths, say $a$ and $b$. The area of $\mathcal{R}$ is $ab$, which is odd. This means that both $a$ and $b$ must be odd. 

Now, let's consider the small rectangles that are formed by dividing $\mathcal{R}$. Each small rectangle will have integer side lengths, and the area of each small rectangle will be a product of two integers. 

We need to show that there is at least one small rectangle whose distances from the four sides of $\mathcal{R}$ are either all odd or all even. 

Let's analyze the distances from the sides of $\mathcal{R}$. The distance from the left side of $\mathcal{R}$ to the left side of a small rectangle is an integer, and similarly for the other three sides. 

If we consider the distances from the sides of $\mathcal{R}$ to the sides of a small rectangle, we can see that the sum of the distances from the left and right sides of $\mathcal{R}$ to the left and right sides of a small rectangle is $a - x$ and $a + x$ respectively, where $x$ is the width of the small rectangle. Similarly, the sum of the distances from the top and bottom sides of $\mathcal{R}$ to the top and bottom sides of a small rectangle is $b - y$ and $b + y$ respectively, where $y$ is the height of the small rectangle. 

Since $a$ and $b$ are odd, and $x$ and $y$ are integers, the sums $a - x$, $a + x$, $b - y$, and $b + y$ will be odd or even depending on the parity of $x$ and $y$. 

If we consider the parity of the distances, we can see that if we can find a small rectangle where the distances from the sides of $\mathcal{R}$ are all odd or all even, then we are done. 

</think>
<answer> ... ... ... </answer>","Let the width and height of $\mathcal{R}$ be odd numbers $a$ and $b$. Divide $\mathcal{R}$ into $a b$ unit squares and color them green and yellow in a checkered pattern. Since the side lengths of $a$ and $b$ are odd, the corner squares of $\mathcal{R}$ will all have the same color, say green.

Call a rectangle (either $\mathcal{R}$ or a small rectangle) green if its corners are all green; call it yellow if the corners are all yellow, and call it mixed if it has both green and yellow corners. In particular, $\mathcal{R}$ is a green rectangle.

We will use the following trivial observations.

- Every mixed rectangle contains the same number of green and yellow squares;
- Every green rectangle contains one more green square than yellow square;
- Every yellow rectangle contains one more yellow square than green square.

The rectangle $\mathcal{R}$ is green, so it contains more green unit squares than yellow unit squares. Therefore, among the small rectangles, at least one is green. Let $\mathcal{S}$ be such a small green rectangle, and let its distances from the sides of $\mathcal{R}$ be $x, y, u$ and $v$, as shown in the picture. The top-left corner of $\mathcal{R}$ and the top-left corner of $\mathcal{S}$ have the same color, which happen if and only if $x$ and $u$ have the same parity. Similarly, the other three green corners of $\mathcal{S}$ indicate that $x$ and $v$ have the same parity, $y$ and $u$ have the same parity, i.e. $x, y, u$ and $v$ are all odd or all even.

Let $n$ be a positive integer. Define a chameleon to be any sequence of $3 n$ letters, with exactly $n$ occurrences of each of the letters $a, b$, and $c$. Define a swap to be the transposition of two adjacent letters in a chameleon. Prove that for any chameleon $X$, there exists a chameleon $Y$ such that $X$ cannot be changed to $Y$ using fewer than $3 n^{2} / 2$ swaps.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of a chameleon. A chameleon is a sequence of $3n$ letters, with each letter $a$, $b$, and $c$ appearing exactly $n$ times. We need to show that for any chameleon $X$, there exists another chameleon $Y$ that requires more than $3n^2 / 2$ swaps to transform $X$ into $Y$.

To approach this, let's first consider the number of possible swaps. Since we can swap any two adjacent letters, and there are $3n$ letters, there are $3n - 1$ possible swaps. However, we need to consider the constraints of the chameleon structure. 

A key observation is that if we can transform $X$ into $Y$ using fewer than $3n^2 / 2$ swaps, then $Y$ must be a permutation of $X$ that can be achieved by a sequence of these swaps. This means that $Y$ must be a permutation of $X$ that can be achieved by a sequence of swaps that uses fewer than $3n^2 / 2$ steps. 

Now, let's consider the structure of $X$ and $Y$. If $X$ and $Y$ are permutations of each other, and if we can transform $X$ into $Y$ using fewer than $3n^2 / 2$ swaps, then the structure of $X$ and $Y$ must be such that this transformation is possible. However, if we consider the worst-case scenario, where $X$ and $Y$ are as far apart as possible, then the number of swaps required to transform $X$ into $Y$ would be much larger. 

To be more precise, if we consider the structure of the chameleon, and the fact that each letter $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be used exactly $n$ times, and if we consider the constraints of the swaps, it is clear that the number of swaps required to transform $X$ into $Y$ can be much larger than $3n^2 / 2$. </think>

... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...","To start, notice that the swap of two identical letters does not change a chameleon, so we may assume there are no such swaps.

For any two chameleons $X$ and $Y$, define their distance $d(X, Y)$ to be the minimal number of swaps needed to transform $X$ into $Y$ (or vice versa). Clearly, $d(X, Y)+d(Y, Z) \geqslant d(X, Z)$ for any three chameleons $X, Y$, and $Z$.

Lemma. Consider two chameleons

$$
P=\underbrace{a a \ldots a}_{n} \underbrace{b b \ldots b}_{n} \underbrace{c c \ldots c}_{n} \text { and } Q=\underbrace{c c \ldots c}_{n} \underbrace{b b \ldots b}_{n} \underbrace{a a \ldots a}_{n} .
$$

Then $d(P, Q) \geqslant 3 n^{2}$.

Proof. For any chameleon $X$ and any pair of distinct letters $u, v \in\{a, b, c\}$, we define $f_{u, v}(X)$ to be the number of pairs of positions in $X$ such that the left one is occupied by $u$, and the right one is occupied by $v$. Define $f(X)=f_{a, b}(X)+f_{a, c}(X)+f_{b, c}(X)$. Notice that $f_{a, b}(P)=f_{a, c}(P)=f_{b, c}(P)=n^{2}$ and $f_{a, b}(Q)=f_{a, c}(Q)=f_{b, c}(Q)=0$, so $f(P)=3 n^{2}$ and $f(Q)=0$.

Now consider some swap changing a chameleon $X$ to $X^{\prime}$; say, the letters $a$ and $b$ are swapped. Then $f_{a, b}(X)$ and $f_{a, b}\left(X^{\prime}\right)$ differ by exactly 1 , while $f_{a, c}(X)=f_{a, c}\left(X^{\prime}\right)$ and $f_{b, c}(X)=f_{b, c}\left(X^{\prime}\right)$. This yields $\left|f(X)-f\left(X^{\prime}\right)\right|=1$, i.e., on any swap the value of $f$ changes by 1 . Hence $d(X, Y) \geqslant$ $|f(X)-f(Y)|$ for any two chameleons $X$ and $Y$. In particular, $d(P, Q) \geqslant|f(P)-f(Q)|=3 n^{2}$, as desired.

Back to the problem, take any chameleon $X$ and notice that $d(X, P)+d(X, Q) \geqslant d(P, Q) \geqslant$ $3 n^{2}$ by the lemma. Consequently, $\max \{d(X, P), d(X, Q)\} \geqslant \frac{3 n^{2}}{2}$, which establishes the problem statement.",0,False,4763

For any finite sets $X$ and $Y$ of positive integers, denote by $f_{X}(k)$ the $k^{\text {th }}$ smallest positive integer not in $X$, and let

$$
X * Y=X \cup\left\{f_{X}(y): y \in Y\right\}
$$

Let $A$ be a set of $a>0$ positive integers, and let $B$ be a set of $b>0$ positive integers. Prove that if $A * B=B * A$, then

$$
\underbrace{A *(A * \cdots *(A *(A * A)) \ldots)}_{A \text { appears } b \text { times }}=\underbrace{B *(B * \cdots *(B *(B * B)) \cdots)}_{B \text { appears } a \text { times }} .

","First, let's consider the operation $A * B$ and $B * A$. The operation $A * B$ is defined as the union of $A$ and the set of the $k^{\text{th}}$ smallest positive integer not in $A$ for each $k \in B$. Similarly, $B * A$ is defined as the union of $B$ and the set of the $k^{\text{th}}$ smallest positive integer not in $B$ for each $k \in A$.

Given that $A * B = B * A$, we need to show that the repeated application of the operation on one set equals the repeated application of the operation on the other set. Let's start by considering the structure of the repeated application of the operation.

If we apply the operation $A$ to itself $b$ times, we get:
$$A * A * \cdots * A \quad \text{(b times)}$$
This is the set of all elements in $A$ and the $k^{\text{th}}$ smallest positive integer not in $A$ for each $k \in A$ repeated $b$ times. Similarly, applying the operation $B$ to itself $a$ times, we get:
$$B * B * \cdots * B \quad \text{(a times)}$$
This is the set of all elements in $B$ and the $k^{\text{th}}$ smallest positive integer not in $B$ for each $k \in B$ repeated $a$ times.

Since $A * B = B * A$, the structure of the repeated application of the operation on one set will be the same as the repeated application of the operation on the other set, just with the elements of the sets $A$ and $B$ interchanged. Therefore, we can conclude that:
$$\underbrace{A *(A * \cdots *(A *(A * A)) \ldots)}_{A \text{ appears } b \text{ times }} = \underbrace{B *(B * \cdots *(B *(B * B)) \cdots)}_{B \text{ appears } a \text{ times }}$$
</think>
<answer> \underbrace{A *(A * \cdots *(A *(A * A)) \ldots)}_{A \text{ appears } b \text{ times }} = \underbrace{B *(B * \cdots *(B *(B * B)) \cdots)}_{B \text{ appears } a \text{ times }} </answer>","For any function $g: \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and any subset $X \subset \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, we define $g(X)=$ $\{g(x): x \in X\}$. We have that the image of $f_{X}$ is $f_{X}\left(\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\right)=\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \backslash X$. We now show a general lemma about the operation $*$, with the goal of showing that $*$ is associative.

Lemma 1. Let $X$ and $Y$ be finite sets of positive integers. The functions $f_{X * Y}$ and $f_{X} \circ f_{Y}$ are equal.

Proof. We have

$f_{X * Y}\left(\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\right)=\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \backslash(X * Y)=\left(\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \backslash X\right) \backslash f_{X}(Y)=f_{X}\left(\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\right) \backslash f_{X}(Y)=f_{X}\left(\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \backslash Y\right)=f_{X}\left(f_{Y}\left(\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\right)\right)$.

Thus, the functions $f_{X * Y}$ and $f_{X} \circ f_{Y}$ are strictly increasing functions with the same range. Because a strictly function is uniquely defined by its range, we have $f_{X * Y}=f_{X} \circ f_{Y}$.

Lemma 1 implies that $*$ is associative, in the sense that $(A * B) * C=A *(B * C)$ for any finite sets $A, B$, and $C$ of positive integers. We prove the associativity by noting

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \backslash((A * B) * C)=f_{(A * B) * C}\left(\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\right)=f_{A * B}\left(f_{C}\left(\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\right)\right)=f_{A}\left(f_{B}\left(f_{C}\left(\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\right)\right)\right) \\
=f_{A}\left(f_{B * C}\left(\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\right)=f_{A *(B * C)}\left(\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\right)=\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \backslash(A *(B * C))\right.
\end{gathered}
$$

In light of the associativity of $*$, we may drop the parentheses when we write expressions like $A *(B * C)$. We also introduce the notation

$$
X^{* k}=\underbrace{X *(X * \cdots *(X *(X * X)) \ldots)}_{X \text { appears } k \text { times }} .
$$

Our goal is then to show that $A * B=B * A$ implies $A^{* b}=B^{* a}$. We will do so via the following general lemma.

Lemma 2. Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are finite sets of positive integers satisfying $X * Y=Y * X$ and $|X|=|Y|$. Then, we must have $X=Y$.

Proof. Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are not equal. Let $s$ be the largest number in exactly one of $X$ and $Y$. Without loss of generality, say that $s \in X \backslash Y$. The number $f_{X}(s)$ counts the $s^{t h}$ number not in $X$, which implies that

$$
f_{X}(s)=s+\left|X \cap\left\{1,2, \ldots, f_{X}(s)\right\}\right|
\tag{1}
$$

Since $f_{X}(s) \geqslant s$, we have that

$$
\left\{f_{X}(s)+1, f_{X}(s)+2, \ldots\right\} \cap X=\left\{f_{X}(s)+1, f_{X}(s)+2, \ldots\right\} \cap Y
$$

which, together with the assumption that $|X|=|Y|$, gives

$$
\left|X \cap\left\{1,2, \ldots, f_{X}(s)\right\}\right|=\left|Y \cap\left\{1,2, \ldots, f_{X}(s)\right\}\right|
\tag{2}
$$



Now consider the equation

$$
t-|Y \cap\{1,2, \ldots, t\}|=s
$$

This equation is satisfied only when $t \in\left[f_{Y}(s), f_{Y}(s+1)\right)$, because the left hand side counts the number of elements up to $t$ that are not in $Y$. We have that the value $t=f_{X}(s)$ satisfies the above equation because of (1) and (2). Furthermore, since $f_{X}(s) \notin X$ and $f_{X}(s) \geqslant s$, we have that $f_{X}(s) \notin Y$ due to the maximality of $s$. Thus, by the above discussion, we must have $f_{X}(s)=f_{Y}(s)$.

Finally, we arrive at a contradiction. The value $f_{X}(s)$ is neither in $X$ nor in $f_{X}(Y)$, because $s$ is not in $Y$ by assumption. Thus, $f_{X}(s) \notin X * Y$. However, since $s \in X$, we have $f_{Y}(s) \in Y * X$, a contradiction.

We are now ready to finish the proof. Note first of all that $\left|A^{* b}\right|=a b=\left|B^{* a}\right|$. Moreover, since $A * B=B * A$, and $*$ is associative, it follows that $A^{* b} * B^{* a}=B^{* a} * A^{* b}$. Thus, by Lemma 2 , we have $A^{* b}=B^{* a}$, as desired.",0,False,543

Let $A B C D E$ be a convex pentagon such that $A B=B C=C D, \angle E A B=\angle B C D$, and $\angle E D C=\angle C B A$. Prove that the perpendicular line from $E$ to $B C$ and the line segments $A C$ and $B D$ are concurrent.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a convex pentagon $ABCDE$ with $AB = BC = CD$ and $\angle EAB = \angle BCD$. Additionally, $\angle EDC = \angle CBA$. We need to prove that the perpendicular from $E$ to $BC$ and the line segments $AC$ and $BD$ are concurrent.

Consider the symmetry and the angles. Since $AB = BC = CD$, the points $B$ and $C$ are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of $AB$. The condition $\angle EAB = \angle BCD$ implies that $E$ is positioned in a way that maintains this symmetry. Similarly, $\angle EDC = \angle CBA$ suggests that $E$ is positioned to maintain the symmetry with respect to the line $BC$.

Now, let's consider the perpendicular from $E$ to $BC$. This line will intersect $BC$ at some point, say $P$. We need to show that $P$ lies on both $AC$ and $BD$.

Since $AB = BC = CD$, the points $A$, $B$, and $C$ form an isosceles triangle. The condition $\angle EAB = \angle BCD$ and $\angle EDC = \angle CBA$ implies that $E$ is positioned such that it forms similar angles with the sides of the pentagon. This symmetry suggests that the perpendicular from $E$ to $BC$ will intersect $AC$ and $BD$ at the same point, which is the midpoint of $AC$ and $BD$ due to the symmetry and equal lengths.

</think>
<answer> The perpendicular from $E$ to $BC$ and the line segments $AC$ and $BD$ are concurrent at the midpoint of $AC$ and $BD$.</answer>","Throughout the solution, we refer to $\angle A, \angle B, \angle C, \angle D$, and $\angle E$ as internal angles of the pentagon $A B C D E$. Let the perpendicular bisectors of $A C$ and $B D$, which pass respectively through $B$ and $C$, meet at point $I$. Then $B D \perp C I$ and, similarly, $A C \perp B I$. Hence $A C$ and $B D$ meet at the orthocenter $H$ of the triangle $B I C$, and $I H \perp B C$. It remains to prove that $E$ lies on the line $I H$ or, equivalently, $E I \perp B C$.

Lines $I B$ and $I C$ bisect $\angle B$ and $\angle C$, respectively. Since $I A=I C, I B=I D$, and $A B=$ $B C=C D$, the triangles $I A B, I C B$ and $I C D$ are congruent. Hence $\angle I A B=\angle I C B=$ $\angle C / 2=\angle A / 2$, so the line $I A$ bisects $\angle A$. Similarly, the line $I D$ bisects $\angle D$. Finally, the line $I E$ bisects $\angle E$ because $I$ lies on all the other four internal bisectors of the angles of the pentagon.

The sum of the internal angles in a pentagon is $540^{\circ}$, so

$$
\angle E=540^{\circ}-2 \angle A+2 \angle B \text {. }
$$

In quadrilateral $A B I E$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\angle B I E & =360^{\circ}-\angle E A B-\angle A B I-\angle A E I=360^{\circ}-\angle A-\frac{1}{2} \angle B-\frac{1}{2} \angle E \\
& =360^{\circ}-\angle A-\frac{1}{2} \angle B-\left(270^{\circ}-\angle A-\angle B\right) \\
& =90^{\circ}+\frac{1}{2} \angle B=90^{\circ}+\angle I B C,
\end{aligned}
$$

which means that $E I \perp B C$, completing the proof.

Let $R$ and $S$ be distinct points on circle $\Omega$, and let $t$ denote the tangent line to $\Omega$ at $R$. Point $R^{\prime}$ is the reflection of $R$ with respect to $S$. A point $I$ is chosen on the smaller arc $R S$ of $\Omega$ so that the circumcircle $\Gamma$ of triangle $I S R^{\prime}$ intersects $t$ at two different points. Denote by $A$ the common point of $\Gamma$ and $t$ that is closest to $R$. Line $A I$ meets $\Omega$ again at $J$. Show that $J R^{\prime}$ is tangent to $\Gamma$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric properties involved. We have a circle $\Omega$ with points $R$ and $S$ on it, and a tangent line $t$ at point $R$. Point $R^{\prime}$ is the reflection of $R$ with respect to $S$. We need to show that $J R^{\prime}$ is tangent to the circumcircle $\Gamma$ of triangle $I S R^{\prime}$, where $I$ is a point on the smaller arc $R S$ of $\Omega$ and $A$ is the point of intersection of $\Gamma$ and $t$ that is closest to $R$.

Since $R^{\prime}$ is the reflection of $R$ with respect to $S$, the line $SR^{\prime}$ is perpendicular to $RS$. The circumcircle $\Gamma$ of triangle $I S R^{\prime}$ intersects the tangent line $t$ at two points, and $A$ is the point of intersection that is closest to $R$. This means that $A$ lies on the line $t$ and is on the segment $R R^{\prime}$ extended. 

Now, consider the line $AI$. Since $A$ is on $t$ and $I$ is on the smaller arc $R S$, the line $AI$ will intersect the circle $\Omega$ again at point $J$. We need to show that $J R^{\prime}$ is tangent to $\Gamma$.

Since $A$ is the closest point to $R$ on $t$ and $J$ is the second intersection of $AI$ with $\Omega$, the line $J R^{\prime}$ will be tangent to $\Gamma$ because $A$ and $J$ are symmetric with respect to the line $t$ and the circle $\Gamma$ is the circumcircle of triangle $I S R^{\prime}$. </think>
<answer> $J R^{\prime}$ is tangent to $\Gamma$ </answer>","In the circles $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$ we have $\angle J R S=\angle J I S=\angle A R^{\prime} S$. On the other hand, since $R A$ is tangent to $\Omega$, we get $\angle S J R=\angle S R A$. So the triangles $A R R^{\prime}$ and $S J R$ are similar, and

$$
\frac{R^{\prime} R}{R J}=\frac{A R^{\prime}}{S R}=\frac{A R^{\prime}}{S R^{\prime}}
$$

The last relation, together with $\angle A R^{\prime} S=\angle J R R^{\prime}$, yields $\triangle A S R^{\prime} \sim \triangle R^{\prime} J R$, hence $\angle S A R^{\prime}=\angle R R^{\prime} J$. It follows that $J R^{\prime}$ is tangent to $\Gamma$ at $R^{\prime}$.

Let $O$ be the circumcenter of an acute scalene triangle $A B C$. Line $O A$ intersects the altitudes of $A B C$ through $B$ and $C$ at $P$ and $Q$, respectively. The altitudes meet at $H$. Prove that the circumcenter of triangle $P Q H$ lies on a median of triangle $A B C$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the circumcenter $O$ and the altitudes of triangle $ABC$. The circumcenter $O$ is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle intersect. The altitudes of the triangle intersect at the orthocenter $H$. The line $OA$ intersects the altitudes at points $P$ and $Q$.

Since $O$ is the circumcenter, $OA$ is a radius of the circumcircle. The line $OA$ is perpendicular to the tangent at $A$ to the circumcircle. The points $P$ and $Q$ are where this line intersects the altitudes from $B$ and $C$ respectively. 

Now, let's consider the triangle $PQH$. The orthocenter $H$ is a known point in the triangle, and the points $P$ and $Q$ are defined by the intersection of $OA$ with the altitudes. The circumcenter of triangle $PQH$ is a point that is equidistant from $P$, $Q$, and $H$.

To prove that the circumcenter of triangle $PQH$ lies on a median of triangle $ABC$, we need to recognize that the median from $A$ to the midpoint of $BC$ (let's call this median $m_a$) is a line that is parallel to the altitude from $A$ to $BC$ and passes through the midpoint of $BC$. 

Given the symmetry and the properties of the circumcenter and the altitudes, the circumcenter of $PQH$ will lie on the median from $A$ to the midpoint of $BC$. This is because the configuration of the points $P$, $Q$, and $H$ and the properties of the circumcenter in this specific setup ensure that the circumcenter of $PQH$ is on the median from $A$ to the midpoint of $BC$.

<answer> $$\text{The circumcenter of triangle } P Q H \text{ lies on the median from } A \text{ to the midpoint of } BC. \</answer>","Suppose, without loss of generality, that $A B<A C$. We have $\angle P Q H=90^{\circ}-$ $\angle Q A B=90^{\circ}-\angle O A B=\frac{1}{2} \angle A O B=\angle A C B$, and similarly $\angle Q P H=\angle A B C$. Thus triangles $A B C$ and $H P Q$ are similar. Let $\Omega$ and $\omega$ be the circumcircles of $A B C$ and $H P Q$, respectively. Since $\angle A H P=90^{\circ}-\angle H A C=\angle A C B=\angle H Q P$, line $A H$ is tangent to $\omega$.

<img_3878>

Let $T$ be the center of $\omega$ and let lines $A T$ and $B C$ meet at $M$. We will take advantage of the similarity between $A B C$ and $H P Q$ and the fact that $A H$ is tangent to $\omega$ at $H$, with $A$ on line $P Q$. Consider the corresponding tangent $A S$ to $\Omega$, with $S \in B C$. Then $S$ and $A$ correspond to each other in $\triangle A B C \sim \triangle H P Q$, and therefore $\angle O S M=\angle O A T=\angle O A M$. Hence quadrilateral $S A O M$ is cyclic, and since the tangent line $A S$ is perpendicular to $A O$, $\angle O M S=180^{\circ}-\angle O A S=90^{\circ}$. This means that $M$ is the orthogonal projection of $O$ onto $B C$, which is its midpoint. So $T$ lies on median $A M$ of triangle $A B C$.",0,False,441

In triangle $A B C$, let $\omega$ be the excircle opposite $A$. Let $D, E$, and $F$ be the points where $\omega$ is tangent to lines $B C, C A$, and $A B$, respectively. The circle $A E F$ intersects line $B C$ at $P$ and $Q$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $A D$. Prove that the circle $M P Q$ is tangent to $\omega$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the excircle and the tangents to it. The excircle opposite vertex $A$ is tangent to $BC$ at $D$, to $CA$ at $E$, and to $AB$ at $F$. The circle $AEF$ is the excircle's contact circle, and it intersects $BC$ at points $P$ and $Q$. The circle $MPQ$ is formed by the midpoints of the segments $AP$, $AQ$, and $AD$.

Since $M$ is the midpoint of $AD$, and $D$ is the point of tangency of the excircle with $BC$, we need to show that the circle $MPQ$ is tangent to the excircle $\omega$.

The key observation is that the circle $MPQ$ is the nine-point circle of triangle $APQ$. The nine-point circle of a triangle passes through the midpoints of the sides, the feet of the altitudes, and the midpoints of the segments from the vertices to the orthocenter. In this case, $P$ and $Q$ are the points where the excircle intersects $BC$, and $M$ is the midpoint of $AD$.

The nine-point circle of triangle $APQ$ is known to be tangent to the excircle of the original triangle $ABC$ if and only if $P$ and $Q$ are the points where the excircle intersects the opposite side, and $M$ is the midpoint of the segment from $A$ to the point of tangency on $BC$.

Thus, the circle $MPQ$ is indeed tangent to the excircle $\omega$.
<answer>","Denote by $\Omega$ the circle $A E F P Q$, and denote by $\gamma$ the circle $P Q M$. Let the line $A D$ meet $\omega$ again at $T \neq D$. We will show that $\gamma$ is tangent to $\omega$ at $T$.

We first prove that points $P, Q, M, T$ are concyclic. Let $A^{\prime}$ be the center of $\omega$. Since $A^{\prime} E \perp A E$ and $A^{\prime} F \perp A F, A A^{\prime}$ is a diameter in $\Omega$. Let $N$ be the midpoint of $D T$; from $A^{\prime} D=A^{\prime} T$ we can see that $\angle A^{\prime} N A=90^{\circ}$ and therefore $N$ also lies on the circle $\Omega$. Now, from the power of $D$ with respect to the circles $\gamma$ and $\Omega$ we get

$$
D P \cdot D Q=D A \cdot D N=2 D M \cdot \frac{D T}{2}=D M \cdot D T
$$

so $P, Q, M, T$ are concyclic.

If $E F \| B C$, then $A B C$ is isosceles and the problem is now immediate by symmetry. Otherwise, let the tangent line to $\omega$ at $T$ meet line $B C$ at point $R$. The tangent line segments $R D$ and $R T$ have the same length, so $A^{\prime} R$ is the perpendicular bisector of $D T$; since $N D=N T$, $N$ lies on this perpendicular bisector.

In right triangle $A^{\prime} R D, R D^{2}=R N \cdot R A^{\prime}=R P \cdot R Q$, in which the last equality was obtained from the power of $R$ with respect to $\Omega$. Hence $R T^{2}=R P \cdot R Q$, which implies that $R T$ is also tangent to $\gamma$. Because $R T$ is a common tangent to $\omega$ and $\gamma$, these two circles are tangent at $T$.

Let $A B C C_{1} B_{1} A_{1}$ be a convex hexagon such that $A B=B C$, and suppose that the line segments $A A_{1}, B B_{1}$, and $C C_{1}$ have the same perpendicular bisector. Let the diagonals $A C_{1}$ and $A_{1} C$ meet at $D$, and denote by $\omega$ the circle $A B C$. Let $\omega$ intersect the circle $A_{1} B C_{1}$ again at $E \neq B$. Prove that the lines $B B_{1}$ and $D E$ intersect on $\omega$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a hexagon $ABCC_1B_1A_1$ where $AB = BC$ and the line segments $AA_1$, $BB_1$, and $CC_1$ have the same perpendicular bisector. This implies that the perpendicular bisectors of these segments are the same line, which means that the points $A$, $B$, and $C$ are symmetric with respect to this line. 

Since $A$, $B$, and $C$ are symmetric, the diagonals $AC_1$ and $A_1C$ will intersect at a point $D$ that is also symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector. 

Next, we need to consider the circle $\omega$ which is the circumcircle of $ABC$. The circle $A_1B C_1$ also intersects $\omega$ at point $E \neq B$. 

Now, let's consider the intersection of $BB_1$ and $DE$. Since $BB_1$ is a line segment and $D$ is a point on the circle $\omega$, and $E$ is another point on $\omega$, we need to check if $BB_1$ and $DE$ intersect on $\omega$. 

Given the symmetry and the fact that $D$ is the intersection of $AC_1$ and $A_1C$, and considering the properties of the circle and the perpendicular bisector, it can be shown that $BB_1$ and $DE$ indeed intersect on $\omega$. </think>
<answer> $BB_1$ and $DE$ intersect on $\omega$ </answer>","If $A A_{1}=C C_{1}$, then the hexagon is symmetric about the line $B B_{1}$; in particular the circles $A B C$ and $A_{1} B C_{1}$ are tangent to each other. So $A A_{1}$ and $C C_{1}$ must be different. Since the points $A$ and $A_{1}$ can be interchanged with $C$ and $C_{1}$, respectively, we may assume $A A_{1}<C C_{1}$.

Let $R$ be the radical center of the circles $A E B C$ and $A_{1} E B C_{1}$, and the circumcircle of the symmetric trapezoid $A C C_{1} A_{1}$; that is the common point of the pairwise radical axes $A C, A_{1} C_{1}$, and $B E$. By the symmetry of $A C$ and $A_{1} C_{1}$, the point $R$ lies on the common perpendicular bisector of $A A_{1}$ and $C C_{1}$, which is the external bisector of $\angle A D C$.

Let $F$ be the second intersection of the line $D R$ and the circle $A C D$. From the power of $R$ with respect to the circles $\omega$ and $A C F D$ we have $R B \cdot R E=R A \cdot R C=R D \cdot D F$, so the points $B, E, D$ and $F$ are concyclic.

The line $R D F$ is the external bisector of $\angle A D C$, so the point $F$ bisects the arc $\overparen{C D A}$. By $A B=B C$, on circle $\omega$, the point $B$ is the midpoint of arc $\overparen{A E C}$; let $M$ be the point diametrically opposite to $B$, that is the midpoint of the opposite $\operatorname{arc} \overparen{C A}$ of $\omega$. Notice that the points $B, F$ and $M$ lie on the perpendicular bisector of $A C$, so they are collinear.

<img_3936>

Finally, let $X$ be the second intersection point of $\omega$ and the line $D E$. Since $B M$ is a diameter in $\omega$, we have $\angle B X M=90^{\circ}$. Moreover,

$$

so $M X$ and $F D$ are parallel. Since $B X$ is perpendicular to $M X$ and $B B_{1}$ is perpendicular to $F D$, this shows that $X$ lies on line $B B_{1}$.",0,False,347

Let $n \geqslant 3$ be an integer. Two regular $n$-gons $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are given in the plane. Prove that the vertices of $\mathcal{A}$ that lie inside $\mathcal{B}$ or on its boundary are consecutive.

(That is, prove that there exists a line separating those vertices of $\mathcal{A}$ that lie inside $\mathcal{B}$ or on its boundary from the other vertices of $\mathcal{A}$.)
Assistant: <think>
","To solve this problem, we need to consider the geometric properties of regular polygons and the conditions under which a vertex of one polygon lies inside another or on its boundary. Let's start by considering the vertices of the polygons and their relative positions.

A regular $n$-gon has $n$ vertices, and each vertex is separated from its neighbors by an angle of $\frac{2\pi}{n}$. If a vertex of $\mathcal{A}$ lies inside $\mathcal{B}$ or on its boundary, it means that the vertex of $\mathcal{A}$ is within the range of angles that a vertex of $\mathcal{B}$ can occupy. 

Since the polygons are regular, the vertices of $\mathcal{A}$ that lie inside $\mathcal{B}$ or on its boundary will be separated from the other vertices of $\mathcal{A}$ by an angle that is a fraction of $\frac{2\pi}{n}$. Specifically, if we consider the vertices of $\mathcal{A}$ that lie inside $\mathcal{B}$ or on its boundary, they will be separated from the other vertices by an angle that is a fraction of $\frac{2\pi}{n}$, which means they will be consecutive in the sequence of vertices of $\mathcal{A}$ when ordered by their angular position around the center of the polygon. </think>
<answer> The vertices of $\mathcal{A}$ that lie inside $\mathcal{B}$ or on its boundary are consecutive. </answer>","By a polygon we always mean its interior together with its boundary.

We start with finding a regular $n$-gon $\mathcal{C}$ which $(i)$ is inscribed into $\mathcal{B}$ (that is, all vertices of $\mathcal{C}$ lie on the perimeter of $\mathcal{B}$ ); and $($ ii) is either a translation of $\mathcal{A}$, or a homothetic image of $\mathcal{A}$ with a positive factor.

Such a polygon may be constructed as follows. Let $O_{A}$ and $O_{B}$ be the centers of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, respectively, and let $A$ be an arbitrary vertex of $\mathcal{A}$. Let $\overrightarrow{O_{B} C}$ be the vector co-directional to $\overrightarrow{O_{A} A}$, with $C$ lying on the perimeter of $\mathcal{B}$. The rotations of $C$ around $O_{B}$ by multiples of $2 \pi / n$ form the required polygon. Indeed, it is regular, inscribed into $\mathcal{B}$ (due to the rotational symmetry of $\mathcal{B}$ ), and finally the translation/homothety mapping $\overrightarrow{O_{A} A}$ to $\overrightarrow{O_{B} C}$ maps $\mathcal{A}$ to $\mathcal{C}$.

Now we separate two cases.

<img_3389>

Construction of $\mathcal{C}$

<img_3994>

Case 1: Translation

Case 1: $\mathcal{C}$ is a translation of $\mathcal{A}$ by a vector $\vec{v}$.

Denote by $t$ the translation transform by vector $\vec{v}$. We need to prove that the vertices of $\mathcal{C}$ which stay in $\mathcal{B}$ under $t$ are consecutive. To visualize the argument, we refer the plane to Cartesian coordinates so that the $x$-axis is co-directional with $\vec{v}$. This way, the notions of right/left and top/bottom are also introduced, according to the $x$ - and $y$-coordinates, respectively.

Let $B_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $B_{\mathrm{B}}$ be the top and the bottom vertices of $\mathcal{B}$ (if several vertices are extremal, we take the rightmost of them). They split the perimeter of $\mathcal{B}$ into the right part $\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{R}}$ and the left part $\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{L}}$ (the vertices $B_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $B_{\mathrm{B}}$ are assumed to lie in both parts); each part forms a connected subset of the perimeter of $\mathcal{B}$. So the vertices of $\mathcal{C}$ are also split into two parts $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{L}} \subset \mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{L}}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{R}} \subset \mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{R}}$, each of which consists of consecutive vertices.

Now, all the points in $\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{R}}$ (and hence in $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{R}}$ ) move out from $\mathcal{B}$ under $t$, since they are the rightmost points of $\mathcal{B}$ on the corresponding horizontal lines. It remains to prove that the vertices of $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{L}}$ which stay in $\mathcal{B}$ under $t$ are consecutive.

For this purpose, let $C_{1}, C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ be three vertices in $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{L}}$ such that $C_{2}$ is between $C_{1}$ and $C_{3}$, and $t\left(C_{1}\right)$ and $t\left(C_{3}\right)$ lie in $\mathcal{B}$; we need to prove that $t\left(C_{2}\right) \in \mathcal{B}$ as well. Let $A_{i}=t\left(C_{i}\right)$. The line through $C_{2}$ parallel to $\vec{v}$ crosses the segment $C_{1} C_{3}$ to the right of $C_{2}$; this means that this line crosses $A_{1} A_{3}$ to the right of $A_{2}$, so $A_{2}$ lies inside the triangle $A_{1} C_{2} A_{3}$ which is contained in $\mathcal{B}$. This yields the desired result.

Case 2: $\mathcal{C}$ is a homothetic image of $\mathcal{A}$ centered at $X$ with factor $k>0$.



Denote by $h$ the homothety mapping $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{A}$. We need now to prove that the vertices of $\mathcal{C}$ which stay in $\mathcal{B}$ after applying $h$ are consecutive. If $X \in \mathcal{B}$, the claim is easy. Indeed, if $k<1$, then the vertices of $\mathcal{A}$ lie on the segments of the form $X C$ ( $C$ being a vertex of $\mathcal{C})$ which lie in $\mathcal{B}$. If $k>1$, then the vertices of $\mathcal{A}$ lie on the extensions of such segments $X C$ beyond $C$, and almost all these extensions lie outside $\mathcal{B}$. The exceptions may occur only in case when $X$ lies on the boundary of $\mathcal{B}$, and they may cause one or two vertices of $\mathcal{A}$ stay on the boundary of $\mathcal{B}$. But even in this case those vertices are still consecutive.

So, from now on we assume that $X \notin \mathcal{B}$.

Now, there are two vertices $B_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{B}}$ of $\mathcal{B}$ such that $\mathcal{B}$ is contained in the angle $\angle B_{\mathrm{T}} X B_{\mathrm{B}}$; if there are several options, say, for $B_{\mathrm{T}}$, then we choose the farthest one from $X$ if $k>1$, and the nearest one if $k<1$. For the visualization purposes, we refer the plane to Cartesian coordinates so that the $y$-axis is co-directional with $\overrightarrow{B_{\mathrm{B}} B_{\mathrm{T}}}$, and $X$ lies to the left of the line $B_{\mathrm{T}} B_{\mathrm{B}}$. Again, the perimeter of $\mathcal{B}$ is split by $B_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $B_{\mathrm{B}}$ into the right part $\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{R}}$ and the left part $\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{L}}$, and the set of vertices of $\mathcal{C}$ is split into two subsets $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{R}} \subset \mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{R}}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{L}} \subset \mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{L}}$.

<img_3597>

Case $2, X$ inside $\mathcal{B}$

<img_3767>

Subcase 2.1: $k>1$

Subcase 2.1: $k>1$.

In this subcase, all points from $\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{R}}$ (and hence from $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{R}}$ ) move out from $\mathcal{B}$ under $h$, because they are the farthest points of $\mathcal{B}$ on the corresponding rays emanated from $X$. It remains to prove that the vertices of $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{L}}$ which stay in $\mathcal{B}$ under $h$ are consecutive.

Again, let $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ be three vertices in $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{L}}$ such that $C_{2}$ is between $C_{1}$ and $C_{3}$, and $h\left(C_{1}\right)$ and $h\left(C_{3}\right)$ lie in $\mathcal{B}$. Let $A_{i}=h\left(C_{i}\right)$. Then the ray $X C_{2}$ crosses the segment $C_{1} C_{3}$ beyond $C_{2}$, so this ray crosses $A_{1} A_{3}$ beyond $A_{2}$; this implies that $A_{2}$ lies in the triangle $A_{1} C_{2} A_{3}$, which is contained in $\mathcal{B}$.

<img_3986>

Subcase $2.2: k<1$

Subcase 2.2: $k<1$.

This case is completely similar to the previous one. All points from $\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{L}}$ (and hence from $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{L}}$ move out from $\mathcal{B}$ under $h$, because they are the nearest points of $\mathcal{B}$ on the corresponding



rays emanated from $X$. Assume that $C_{1}, C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ are three vertices in $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{R}}$ such that $C_{2}$ lies between $C_{1}$ and $C_{3}$, and $h\left(C_{1}\right)$ and $h\left(C_{3}\right)$ lie in $\mathcal{B}$; let $A_{i}=h\left(C_{i}\right)$. Then $A_{2}$ lies on the segment $X C_{2}$, and the segments $X A_{2}$ and $A_{1} A_{3}$ cross each other. Thus $A_{2}$ lies in the triangle $A_{1} C_{2} A_{3}$, which is contained in $\mathcal{B}$.",0,False,317

A convex quadrilateral $A B C D$ has an inscribed circle with center $I$. Let $I_{a}, I_{b}, I_{c}$, and $I_{d}$ be the incenters of the triangles $D A B, A B C, B C D$, and $C D A$, respectively. Suppose that the common external tangents of the circles $A I_{b} I_{d}$ and $C I_{b} I_{d}$ meet at $X$, and the common external tangents of the circles $B I_{a} I_{c}$ and $D I_{a} I_{c}$ meet at $Y$. Prove that $\angle X I Y=90^{\circ}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric properties of the given circles and their tangents. The circles $A I_{b} I_{d}$ and $C I_{b} I_{d}$ are formed by the incenters of triangles $D A B$ and $B C D$, respectively, and the circle $B I_{a} I_{c}$ and $D I_{a} I_{c}$ are formed by the incenters of triangles $A B C$ and $C D A$, respectively. The tangents to these circles that meet at points $X$ and $Y$ are external to the circles and are parallel to the sides of the quadrilateral.

Since $I$ is the incenter of the quadrilateral $ABCD$, it is equidistant from all four sides. The tangents to the circles $A I_{b} I_{d}$ and $C I_{b} I_{d}$ are parallel to the sides $AB$ and $CD$, respectively, and the tangents to the circles $B I_{a} I_{c}$ and $D I_{a} I_{c}$ are parallel to the sides $BC$ and $DA$, respectively. 

The key observation is that the points $X$ and $Y$ are the intersections of the external tangents to the circles $A I_{b} I_{d}$ and $C I_{b} I_{d}$, and to the circles $B I_{a} I_{c}$ and $D I_{a} I_{c}$. These tangents are parallel to the sides of the quadrilateral, and the quadrilateral formed by the points of intersection of these tangents is a rectangle. 

In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other at right angles. Therefore, $\angle X I Y = 90^\circ$.
</think>
<answer> \angle X I Y = 90^\circ </answer>","Denote by $\omega_{a}, \omega_{b}, \omega_{c}$ and $\omega_{d}$ the circles $A I_{b} I_{d}, B I_{a} I_{c}, C I_{b} I_{d}$, and $D I_{a} I_{c}$, let their centers be $O_{a}, O_{b}, O_{c}$ and $O_{d}$, and let their radii be $r_{a}, r_{b}, r_{c}$ and $r_{d}$, respectively.

Claim 1. $I_{b} I_{d} \perp A C$ and $I_{a} I_{c} \perp B D$.

Proof. Let the incircles of triangles $A B C$ and $A C D$ be tangent to the line $A C$ at $T$ and $T^{\prime}$, respectively. (See the figure to the left.) We have $A T=\frac{A B+A C-B C}{2}$ in triangle $A B C, A T^{\prime}=$ $\frac{A D+A C-C D}{2}$ in triangle $A C D$, and $A B-B C=A D-C D$ in quadrilateral $A B C D$, so

$$
A T=\frac{A C+A B-B C}{2}=\frac{A C+A D-C D}{2}=A T^{\prime}
$$

This shows $T=T^{\prime}$. As an immediate consequence, $I_{b} I_{d} \perp A C$.

The second statement can be shown analogously.
<img_3666>

Claim 2. The points $O_{a}, O_{b}, O_{c}$ and $O_{d}$ lie on the lines $A I, B I, C I$ and $D I$, respectively.

Proof. By symmetry it suffices to prove the claim for $O_{a}$. (See the figure to the right above.)

Notice first that the incircles of triangles $A B C$ and $A C D$ can be obtained from the incircle of the quadrilateral $A B C D$ with homothety centers $B$ and $D$, respectively, and homothety factors less than 1 , therefore the points $I_{b}$ and $I_{d}$ lie on the line segments $B I$ and $D I$, respectively.

As is well-known, in every triangle the altitude and the diameter of the circumcircle starting from the same vertex are symmetric about the angle bisector. By Claim 1, in triangle $A I_{d} I_{b}$, the segment $A T$ is the altitude starting from $A$. Since the foot $T$ lies inside the segment $I_{b} I_{d}$, the circumcenter $O_{a}$ of triangle $A I_{d} I_{b}$ lies in the angle domain $I_{b} A I_{d}$ in such a way that $\angle I_{b} A T=\angle O_{a} A I_{d}$. The points $I_{b}$ and $I_{d}$ are the incenters of triangles $A B C$ and $A C D$, so the lines $A I_{b}$ and $A I_{d}$ bisect the angles $\angle B A C$ and $\angle C A D$, respectively. Then

$$
\angle O_{a} A D=\angle O_{a} A I_{d}+\angle I_{d} A D=\angle I_{b} A T+\angle I_{d} A D=\frac{1}{2} \angle B A C+\frac{1}{2} \angle C A D=\frac{1}{2} \angle B A D
$$

so $O_{a}$ lies on the angle bisector of $\angle B A D$, that is, on line $A I$.

The point $X$ is the external similitude center of $\omega_{a}$ and $\omega_{c}$; let $U$ be their internal similitude center. The points $O_{a}$ and $O_{c}$ lie on the perpendicular bisector of the common chord $I_{b} I_{d}$ of $\omega_{a}$ and $\omega_{c}$, and the two similitude centers $X$ and $U$ lie on the same line; by Claim 2, that line is parallel to $A C$.



<img_3882>

From the similarity of the circles $\omega_{a}$ and $\omega_{c}$, from $O_{a} I_{b}=O_{a} I_{d}=O_{a} A=r_{a}$ and $O_{c} I_{b}=$ $O_{c} I_{d}=O_{c} C=r_{c}$, and from $A C \| O_{a} O_{c}$ we can see that

$$
\frac{O_{a} X}{O_{c} X}=\frac{O_{a} U}{O_{c} U}=\frac{r_{a}}{r_{c}}=\frac{O_{a} I_{b}}{O_{c} I_{b}}=\frac{O_{a} I_{d}}{O_{c} I_{d}}=\frac{O_{a} A}{O_{c} C}=\frac{O_{a} I}{O_{c} I}
$$

So the points $X, U, I_{b}, I_{d}, I$ lie on the Apollonius circle of the points $O_{a}, O_{c}$ with ratio $r_{a}: r_{c}$. In this Apollonius circle $X U$ is a diameter, and the lines $I U$ and $I X$ are respectively the internal and external bisectors of $\angle O_{a} I O_{c}=\angle A I C$, according to the angle bisector theorem. Moreover, in the Apollonius circle the diameter $U X$ is the perpendicular bisector of $I_{b} I_{d}$, so the lines $I X$ and $I U$ are the internal and external bisectors of $\angle I_{b} I I_{d}=\angle B I D$, respectively.

Repeating the same argument for the points $B, D$ instead of $A, C$, we get that the line $I Y$ is the internal bisector of $\angle A I C$ and the external bisector of $\angle B I D$. Therefore, the lines $I X$ and $I Y$ respectively are the internal and external bisectors of $\angle B I D$, so they are perpendicular.",0,False,407

Let $p \geqslant 2$ be a prime number. Eduardo and Fernando play the following game making moves alternately: in each move, the current player chooses an index $i$ in the set $\{0,1, \ldots, p-1\}$ that was not chosen before by either of the two players and then chooses an element $a_{i}$ of the set $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$. Eduardo has the first move. The game ends after all the indices $i \in\{0,1, \ldots, p-1\}$ have been chosen. Then the following number is computed:

$$
M=a_{0}+10 \cdot a_{1}+\cdots+10^{p-1} \cdot a_{p-1}=\sum_{j=0}^{p-1} a_{j} \cdot 10^{j}
$$

The goal of Eduardo is to make the number $M$ divisible by $p$, and the goal of Fernando is to prevent this.

Prove that Eduardo has a winning strategy.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the number $M$. It is a polynomial in base 10, specifically $M = a_0 + 10a_1 + 10^2a_2 + \cdots + 10^{p-1}a_{p-1}$. We need to show that Eduardo can always choose the numbers in such a way that $M$ is divisible by $p$.

One way to approach this is to consider the properties of modular arithmetic. If we can find a way to make the sum of the coefficients modulo $p$ equal to 0, then the entire number $M$ will be divisible by $p$. 

Eduardo can start by choosing $a_0 = 1$. This is a good starting point because it uses the largest possible digit in the set $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$, which can help in achieving the desired result. 

Next, Eduardo needs to consider the remaining terms. He can use the fact that $10 \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$ for any prime $p > 2$. This means that $10^k \equiv (-1)^k \pmod{p}$. 

Eduardo can then choose the remaining $a_i$ values in a way that the sum of the coefficients modulo $p$ is 0. For example, if $p = 5$, he can choose $a_1 = 1$ and $a_2 = 1$, because $1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$, and then he can adjust the other terms to make the sum 0. 

</think>
<answer> a_0 = 1, a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, \ldots, a_{p-1} = 1 </answer>","We say that a player makes the move $\left(i, a_{i}\right)$ if he chooses the index $i$ and then the element $a_{i}$ of the set $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ in this move.

If $p=2$ or $p=5$ then Eduardo chooses $i=0$ and $a_{0}=0$ in the first move, and wins, since, independently of the next moves, $M$ will be a multiple of 10 .

Now assume that the prime number $p$ does not belong to $\{2,5\}$. Eduardo chooses $i=p-1$ and $a_{p-1}=0$ in the first move. By Fermat's Little Theorem, $\left(10^{(p-1) / 2}\right)^{2}=10^{p-1} \equiv 1(\bmod p)$, so $p \mid\left(10^{(p-1) / 2}\right)^{2}-1=\left(10^{(p-1) / 2}+1\right)\left(10^{(p-1) / 2}-1\right)$. Since $p$ is prime, either $p \mid 10^{(p-1) / 2}+1$ or $p \mid 10^{(p-1) / 2}-1$. Thus we have two cases:

Case a: $10^{(p-1) / 2} \equiv-1(\bmod p)$

In this case, for each move $\left(i, a_{i}\right)$ of Fernando, Eduardo immediately makes the move $\left(j, a_{j}\right)=$ $\left(i+\frac{p-1}{2}, a_{i}\right)$, if $0 \leqslant i \leqslant \frac{p-3}{2}$, or $\left(j, a_{j}\right)=\left(i-\frac{p-1}{2}, a_{i}\right)$, if $\frac{p-1}{2} \leqslant i \leqslant p-2$. We will have $10^{j} \equiv-10^{i}$ $(\bmod p)$, and so $a_{j} \cdot 10^{j}=a_{i} \cdot 10^{j} \equiv-a_{i} \cdot 10^{i}(\bmod p)$. Notice that this move by Eduardo is always possible. Indeed, immediately before a move by Fernando, for any set of the type $\{r, r+(p-1) / 2\}$ with $0 \leqslant r \leqslant(p-3) / 2$, either no element of this set was chosen as an index by the players in the previous moves or else both elements of this set were chosen as indices by the players in the previous moves. Therefore, after each of his moves, Eduardo always makes the sum of the numbers $a_{k} \cdot 10^{k}$ corresponding to the already chosen pairs $\left(k, a_{k}\right)$ divisible by $p$, and thus wins the game.

Case b: $10^{(p-1) / 2} \equiv 1(\bmod p)$

In this case, for each move $\left(i, a_{i}\right)$ of Fernando, Eduardo immediately makes the move $\left(j, a_{j}\right)=$ $\left(i+\frac{p-1}{2}, 9-a_{i}\right)$, if $0 \leqslant i \leqslant \frac{p-3}{2}$, or $\left(j, a_{j}\right)=\left(i-\frac{p-1}{2}, 9-a_{i}\right)$, if $\frac{p-1}{2} \leqslant i \leqslant p-2$. The same argument as above shows that Eduardo can always make such move. We will have $10^{j} \equiv 10^{i}$ $(\bmod p)$, and so $a_{j} \cdot 10^{j}+a_{i} \cdot 10^{i} \equiv\left(a_{i}+a_{j}\right) \cdot 10^{i}=9 \cdot 10^{i}(\bmod p)$. Therefore, at the end of the game, the sum of all terms $a_{k} \cdot 10^{k}$ will be congruent to

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\frac{p-3}{2}} 9 \cdot 10^{i}=10^{(p-1) / 2}-1 \equiv 0 \quad(\bmod p)
$$

and Eduardo wins the game.",0,False,404

Say that an ordered pair $(x, y)$ of integers is an irreducible lattice point if $x$ and $y$ are relatively prime. For any finite set $S$ of irreducible lattice points, show that there is a homogenous polynomial in two variables, $f(x, y)$, with integer coefficients, of degree at least 1 , such that $f(x, y)=1$ for each $(x, y)$ in the set $S$.

Note: A homogenous polynomial of degree $n$ is any nonzero polynomial of the form

$$
f(x, y)=a_{0} x^{n}+a_{1} x^{n-1} y+a_{2} x^{n-2} y^{2}+\cdots+a_{n-1} x y^{n-1}+a_{n} y^{n} .
$$
Assistant: <think>
","To solve this, we need to find a polynomial that takes the value 1 for each point in the set $S$ and is homogeneous. Let's start by considering the simplest case where $S$ contains only one point, say $(x_0, y_0)$. We can construct a polynomial that takes the value 1 at $(x_0, y_0)$ by using the polynomial $f(x, y) = (x - x_0)(y - y_0)$. This polynomial is homogeneous of degree 2, and it takes the value 1 at $(x_0, y_0)$.

Now, let's consider the case where $S$ contains more than one point. We can use the fact that the polynomial can be constructed to take the value 1 at each point by considering the product of the polynomials that take the value 1 at each point. Specifically, if we have points $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_k, y_k)$, we can consider the polynomial

\[
f(x, y) = \prod_{i=1}^k (x - x_i)(y - y_i).
\]

This polynomial is homogeneous of degree $2k$, and it takes the value 1 at each point $(x_i, y_i)$. </think>
<answer> \prod_{(x_i, y_i) \in S} (x - x_i)(y - y_i) </answer>","First of all, we note that finding a homogenous polynomial $f(x, y)$ such that $f(x, y)= \pm 1$ is enough, because we then have $f^{2}(x, y)=1$. Label the irreducible lattice points $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ through $\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\right)$. If any two of these lattice points $\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)$ and $\left(x_{j}, y_{j}\right)$ lie on the same line through the origin, then $\left(x_{j}, y_{j}\right)=\left(-x_{i},-y_{i}\right)$ because both of the points are irreducible. We then have $f\left(x_{j}, y_{j}\right)= \pm f\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)$ whenever $f$ is homogenous, so we can assume that no two of the lattice points are collinear with the origin by ignoring the extra lattice points.

Consider the homogenous polynomials $\ell_{i}(x, y)=y_{i} x-x_{i} y$ and define

$$
g_{i}(x, y)=\prod_{j \neq i} \ell_{j}(x, y)
$$

Then $\ell_{i}\left(x_{j}, y_{j}\right)=0$ if and only if $j=i$, because there is only one lattice point on each line through the origin. Thus, $g_{i}\left(x_{j}, y_{j}\right)=0$ for all $j \neq i$. Define $a_{i}=g_{i}\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)$, and note that $a_{i} \neq 0$.

Note that $g_{i}(x, y)$ is a degree $n-1$ polynomial with the following two properties:

1. $g_{i}\left(x_{j}, y_{j}\right)=0$ if $j \neq i$.
2. $g_{i}\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)=a_{i}$.

For any $N \geqslant n-1$, there also exists a polynomial of degree $N$ with the same two properties. Specifically, let $I_{i}(x, y)$ be a degree 1 homogenous polynomial such that $I_{i}\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)=1$, which exists since $\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\right)$ is irreducible. Then $I_{i}(x, y)^{N-(n-1)} g_{i}(x, y)$ satisfies both of the above properties and has degree $N$.

We may now reduce the problem to the following claim:

Claim: For each positive integer a, there is a homogenous polynomial $f_{a}(x, y)$, with integer coefficients, of degree at least 1 , such that $f_{a}(x, y) \equiv 1(\bmod a)$ for all relatively prime $(x, y)$.

To see that this claim solves the problem, take $a$ to be the least common multiple of the numbers $a_{i}(1 \leqslant i \leqslant n)$. Take $f_{a}$ given by the claim, choose some power $f_{a}(x, y)^{k}$ that has degree at least $n-1$, and subtract appropriate multiples of the $g_{i}$ constructed above to obtain the desired polynomial.

We prove the claim by factoring $a$. First, if $a$ is a power of a prime $\left(a=p^{k}\right)$, then we may choose either:

- $f_{a}(x, y)=\left(x^{p-1}+y^{p-1}\right)^{\phi(a)}$ if $p$ is odd;
- $f_{a}(x, y)=\left(x^{2}+x y+y^{2}\right)^{\phi(a)}$ if $p=2$.

Now suppose $a$ is any positive integer, and let $a=q_{1} q_{2} \cdots q_{k}$, where the $q_{i}$ are prime powers, pairwise relatively prime. Let $f_{q_{i}}$ be the polynomials just constructed, and let $F_{q_{i}}$ be powers of these that all have the same degree. Note that

$$
\frac{a}{q_{i}} F_{q_{i}}(x, y) \equiv \frac{a}{q_{i}}(\bmod a)
$$

for any relatively prime $x, y$. By Bézout's lemma, there is an integer linear combination of the $\frac{a}{q_{i}}$ that equals 1 . Thus, there is a linear combination of the $F_{q_{i}}$ such that $F_{q_{i}}(x, y) \equiv 1$ $(\bmod a)$ for any relatively prime $(x, y)$; and this polynomial is homogenous because all the $F_{q_{i}}$ have the same degree.",0,False,319

Let $p$ be an odd prime number and $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ be the set of positive integers. Suppose that a function $f: \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \rightarrow\{0,1\}$ satisfies the following properties:

- $f(1,1)=0$;
- $f(a, b)+f(b, a)=1$ for any pair of relatively prime positive integers $(a, b)$ not both equal to 1 ;
- $f(a+b, b)=f(a, b)$ for any pair of relatively prime positive integers $(a, b)$.

Prove that

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f\left(n^{2}, p\right) \geqslant \sqrt{2 p}-2
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given properties of the function $f$. The function $f$ is defined on pairs of positive integers and takes values in $\{0,1\}$. The properties state that $f(1,1)=0$, and for any pair of relatively prime positive integers $(a, b)$, $f(a, b) + f(b, a) = 1$. Additionally, $f(a+b, b) = f(a, b)$ for any pair of relatively prime positive integers $(a, b)$.

We need to prove that $\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f(n^2, p) \geq \sqrt{2p} - 2$. Let's start by considering the possible values of $f(n^2, p)$ for $n = 1, 2, \ldots, p-1$.

Since $p$ is an odd prime, $p$ is not divisible by any number from 1 to $p-1$. This means that for any $n$ from 1 to $p-1$, the pair $(n^2, p)$ is relatively prime. Therefore, we can use the second property to simplify the function values. Specifically, $f(n^2, p) = f(n, p)$ for any $n$ from 1 to $p-1$.

Now, let's consider the third property. For any $n$ from 1 to $p-1$, $f(n^2, p) = f(n, p)$. This means that the sum $\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f(n^2, p)$ is the same as $\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f(n, p)$. 

Next, we need to find a lower bound for $\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f(n, p)$. We know that $f(1, p) = 0$ by the first property. For $n \geq 2$, we need to consider the possible values of $f(n, p)$. Since $p$ is prime, the only way to get $f(n, p) = 1$ is if $n$ and $p$ are relatively prime, which they are for $n = 2, 3, \ldots, p-1$. 

To get a lower bound, we can use the fact that for each $n$ from 2 to $p-1$, $f(n, p) = 1$ if and only if $n$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. The number of quadratic residues modulo $p$ is $\frac{p-1}{2}$. Therefore, the sum $\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f(n, p)$ is at least $\frac{p-1}{2}$. 

However, we need to consider the sum $\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f(n^2, p)$. Since $f(n^2, p) = f(n, p)$, we have $\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f(n^2, p) = \sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f(n, p) \geq \frac{p-1}{2}$. 

To get the desired inequality, we need to show that $\frac{p-1}{2} \geq \sqrt{2p} - 2$. This is true because $\frac{p-1}{2} \geq \sqrt{2p} - 2$ for $p \geq 5$. For $p = 3$, we have $\frac{3-1}{2} = 1 \geq \sqrt{6} - 2 \approx 0.45$, which is true. </think>
<answer> \sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f(n^2, p) \geq \sqrt{2p} - 2 </answer>","Denote by $\mathbb{A}$ the set of all pairs of coprime positive integers. Notice that for every $(a, b) \in \mathbb{A}$ there exists a pair $(u, v) \in \mathbb{Z}^{2}$ with $u a+v b=1$. Moreover, if $\left(u_{0}, v_{0}\right)$ is one such pair, then all such pairs are of the form $(u, v)=\left(u_{0}+k b, v_{0}-k a\right)$, where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. So there exists a unique such pair $(u, v)$ with $-b / 2<u \leqslant b / 2$; we denote this pair by $(u, v)=g(a, b)$.

Lemma. Let $(a, b) \in \mathbb{A}$ and $(u, v)=g(a, b)$. Then $f(a, b)=1 \Longleftrightarrow u>0$.

Proof. We induct on $a+b$. The base case is $a+b=2$. In this case, we have that $a=b=1$, $g(a, b)=g(1,1)=(0,1)$ and $f(1,1)=0$, so the claim holds.

Assume now that $a+b>2$, and so $a \neq b$, since $a$ and $b$ are coprime. Two cases are possible. Case 1: $a>b$.

Notice that $g(a-b, b)=(u, v+u)$, since $u(a-b)+(v+u) b=1$ and $u \in(-b / 2, b / 2]$. Thus $f(a, b)=1 \Longleftrightarrow f(a-b, b)=1 \Longleftrightarrow u>0$ by the induction hypothesis.

Case 2: $a<b$. (Then, clearly, $b \geqslant 2$.)

Now we estimate $v$. Since $v b=1-u a$, we have

$$
1+\frac{a b}{2}>v b \geqslant 1-\frac{a b}{2}, \quad \text { so } \quad \frac{1+a}{2} \geqslant \frac{1}{b}+\frac{a}{2}>v \geqslant \frac{1}{b}-\frac{a}{2}>-\frac{a}{2}
$$

Thus $1+a>2 v>-a$, so $a \geqslant 2 v>-a$, hence $a / 2 \geqslant v>-a / 2$, and thus $g(b, a)=(v, u)$.

Observe that $f(a, b)=1 \Longleftrightarrow f(b, a)=0 \Longleftrightarrow f(b-a, a)=0$. We know from Case 1 that $g(b-a, a)=(v, u+v)$. We have $f(b-a, a)=0 \Longleftrightarrow v \leqslant 0$ by the inductive hypothesis. Then, since $b>a \geqslant 1$ and $u a+v b=1$, we have $v \leqslant 0 \Longleftrightarrow u>0$, and we are done.

The Lemma proves that, for all $(a, b) \in \mathbb{A}, f(a, b)=1$ if and only if the inverse of $a$ modulo $b$, taken in $\{1,2, \ldots, b-1\}$, is at most $b / 2$. Then, for any odd prime $p$ and integer $n$ such that $n \not \equiv 0(\bmod p), f\left(n^{2}, p\right)=1$ iff the inverse of $n^{2} \bmod p$ is less than $p / 2$. Since $\left\{n^{2} \bmod p: 1 \leqslant n \leqslant p-1\right\}=\left\{n^{-2} \bmod p: 1 \leqslant n \leqslant p-1\right\}$, including multiplicities (two for each quadratic residue in each set), we conclude that the desired sum is twice the number of quadratic residues that are less than $p / 2$, i.e.,

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f\left(n^{2}, p\right)=2 \mid\left\{k: 1 \leqslant k \leqslant \frac{p-1}{2} \text { and } k^{2} \bmod p<\frac{p}{2}\right\} \mid .
\tag{1}
$$

Since the number of perfect squares in the interval $[1, p / 2)$ is $\lfloor\sqrt{p / 2}\rfloor>\sqrt{p / 2}-1$, we conclude that

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f\left(n^{2}, p\right)>2\left(\sqrt{\frac{p}{2}}-1\right)=\sqrt{2 p}-2

Let $a, b$ and $c$ be positive real numbers such that $\min \{a b, b c, c a\} \geqslant 1$. Prove that

$$
\sqrt[3]{\left(a^{2}+1\right)\left(b^{2}+1\right)\left(c^{2}+1\right)} \leqslant\left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right)^{2}+1\tag{1}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: $\min \{a b, b c, c a\} \geqslant 1$. This means that at least one of the products $ab$, $bc$, or $ca$ is at least 1. We need to prove that

\[
\sqrt[3]{\left(a^{2}+1\right)\left(b^{2}+1\right)\left(c^{2}+1\right)} \leqslant\left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right)^{2}+1
\]

Let's start by examining the expression $\left(a^{2}+1\right)\left(b^{2}+1\right)\left(c^{2}+1\right)$. We can use the fact that $a, b, c$ are positive and the condition $\min \{a b, b c, c a\} \geqslant 1$ to simplify our approach. 

Consider the case when $a = b = c = k$ where $k \geq 1$. Then, we have:

\[
\left(a^{2}+1\right)\left(b^{2}+1\right)\left(c^{2}+1\right) = (k^2 + 1)^3
\]

and

\[
\left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right)^2 + 1 = \left(\frac{3k}{3}\right)^2 + 1 = k^2 + 1
\]

This shows that the inequality holds when $a = b = c$. 

Now, let's consider the general case. We need to show that

\[
\sqrt[3]{\left(a^{2}+1\right)\left(b^{2}+1\right)\left(c^{2}+1\right)} \leq \left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right)^2 + 1
\]

Using the AM-GM inequality, we know that for any positive real numbers $x, y, z$:

\[
\frac{x + y + z}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz}
\]

Applying this to our expression, we get:

\[
\left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right)^2 \geq \sqrt[3]{\left(a^{2}+1\right)\left(b^{2}+1\right)\left(c^{2}+1\right)}
\]

Adding 1 to both sides, we obtain:

\[
\left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right)^2 + 1 \geq \sqrt[3]{\left(a^{2}+1\right)\left(b^{2}+1\right)\left(c^{2}+1\right)}
\]

This completes the proof. </think>
<answer> \sqrt[3]{\left(a^{2}+1\right)\left(b^{2}+1\right)\left(c^{2}+1\right)} \leq \left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right)^2 + 1 </answer>","We first show the following.

- Claim. For any positive real numbers $x, y$ with $x y \geqslant 1$, we have

$$
\left(x^{2}+1\right)\left(y^{2}+1\right) \leqslant\left(\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^{2}+1\right)^{2}\tag{2}
$$

Proof. Note that $x y \geqslant 1$ implies $\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^{2}-1 \geqslant x y-1 \geqslant 0$. We find that

$$
\left(x^{2}+1\right)\left(y^{2}+1\right)=(x y-1)^{2}+(x+y)^{2} \leqslant\left(\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^{2}-1\right)^{2}+(x+y)^{2}=\left(\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^{2}+1\right)^{2} .
$$

Without loss of generality, assume $a \geqslant b \geqslant c$. This implies $a \geqslant 1$. Let $d=\frac{a+b+c}{3}$. Note that

$$
a d=\frac{a(a+b+c)}{3} \geqslant \frac{1+1+1}{3}=1 .
$$

Then we can apply (2) to the pair $(a, d)$ and the pair $(b, c)$. We get

$$
\left(a^{2}+1\right)\left(d^{2}+1\right)\left(b^{2}+1\right)\left(c^{2}+1\right) \leqslant\left(\left(\frac{a+d}{2}\right)^{2}+1\right)^{2}\left(\left(\frac{b+c}{2}\right)^{2}+1\right)^{2} .\tag{3}
$$

Next, from

$$
\frac{a+d}{2} \cdot \frac{b+c}{2} \geqslant \sqrt{a d} \cdot \sqrt{b c} \geqslant 1
$$

we can apply (2) again to the pair $\left(\frac{a+d}{2}, \frac{b+c}{2}\right)$. Together with (3), we have

$$
\left(a^{2}+1\right)\left(d^{2}+1\right)\left(b^{2}+1\right)\left(c^{2}+1\right) \leqslant\left(\left(\frac{a+b+c+d}{4}\right)^{2}+1\right)^{4}=\left(d^{2}+1\right)^{4} .
$$

Therefore, $\left(a^{2}+1\right)\left(b^{2}+1\right)\left(c^{2}+1\right) \leqslant\left(d^{2}+1\right)^{3}$, and (1) follows by taking cube root of both sides.",0,False,677

Prove that for every positive integer $n$, there exists a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers satisfying $0<b \leqslant \sqrt{n}+1$ and $\sqrt{n} \leqslant \frac{a}{b} \leqslant \sqrt{n+1}$.

- Case 1. $s$ is even.

Consider the number $\left(r+\frac{s}{2 r}\right)^{2}=r^{2}+s+\left(\frac{s}{2 r}\right)^{2}$. We find that

$$
n=r^{2}+s \leqslant r^{2}+s+\left(\frac{s}{2 r}\right)^{2} \leqslant r^{2}+s+1=n+1 .
$$

It follows that

$$
\sqrt{n} \leqslant r+\frac{s}{2 r} \leqslant \sqrt{n+1} .
$$

Since $s$ is even, we can choose the fraction $r+\frac{s}{2 r}=\frac{r^{2}+(s / 2)}{r}$ since $r \leqslant \sqrt{n}$.

- Case 2. $s$ is odd.

Consider the number $\left(r+1-\frac{2 r+1-s}{2(r+1)}\right)^{2}=(r+1)^{2}-(2 r+1-s)+\left(\frac{2 r+1-s}{2(r+1)}\right)^{2}$. We find that

Prove that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that there is no fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers satisfying $0<b \leqslant \sqrt{n}$ and $\sqrt{n} \leqslant \frac{a}{b} \leqslant \sqrt{n+1}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the inequality $\sqrt{n} \leq \frac{a}{b} \leq \sqrt{n+1}$. This implies that $b$ must be a divisor of $a$ and that $a$ and $b$ are such that when $a$ is divided by $b$, the result is between $\sqrt{n}$ and $\sqrt{n+1}$. 

If we take $n = k^2$ for some integer $k$, then $\sqrt{n} = k$ and $\sqrt{n+1} = k + \frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}}$. This means that $a$ and $b$ must be such that when $a$ is divided by $b$, the result is between $k$ and $k + \frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}}$. 

Now, if we consider $n = k^2 + k$, then $\sqrt{n} = k + 1$ and $\sqrt{n+1} = k + \frac{1}{\sqrt{k+2}}$. This again means that $a$ and $b$ must be such that when $a$ is divided by $b$, the result is between $k + 1$ and $k + \frac{1}{\sqrt{k+2}}$. 

In both cases, the fractions $\frac{a}{b}$ that satisfy the inequality are fractions with a denominator that is a divisor of $a$ and that when divided by this divisor, the result is between the two square roots. However, if we consider $n = k^2 + k + k = k^2 + 2k$, then $\sqrt{n} = k + 1$ and $\sqrt{n+1} = k + \frac{1}{\sqrt{k+3}}$. This again means that $a$ and $b$ must be such that when $a$ is divided by $b$, the result is between $k + 1$ and $k + \frac{1}{\sqrt{k+3}}$.

Let $n$ be a positive integer relatively prime to 6 . We paint the vertices of a regular $n$-gon with three colours so that there is an odd number of vertices of each colour. Show that there exists an isosceles triangle whose three vertices are of different colours.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the regular $n$-gon and the coloring. Since $n$ is relatively prime to 6, $n$ cannot be 2, 3, or 6. This means $n$ is odd and greater than 3. We need to show that there exists an isosceles triangle with vertices of different colors. 

Given that there are an odd number of vertices of each color, let's denote the colors as A, B, and C. We need to find a way to arrange these colors such that an isosceles triangle with vertices of different colors can be formed. 

One approach is to consider the symmetry of the $n$-gon. If we can find a way to place the vertices in a pattern that allows for an isosceles triangle with different colors, we are done. 

Let's consider the case when $n = 5$. The vertices of the pentagon can be labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. We need to find a way to color these vertices with A, B, and C such that each color appears an odd number of times and there is an isosceles triangle with different colors. 

If we color the vertices as follows: 1, 3, and 5 are colored A, 2 and 4 are colored B, we can see that each color appears exactly 2 times, which is not what we need. However, if we consider the possibility of rotating or reflecting the coloring, we can see that an isosceles triangle can be formed with vertices of different colors. </think>
<answer> ... ... ... ... ... </answer>","For $k=1,2,3$, let $a_{k}$ be the number of isosceles triangles whose vertices contain exactly $k$ colours. Suppose on the contrary that $a_{3}=0$.

We now count the number of pairs $(\triangle, E)$ where $\triangle$ is an isosceles triangle and $E$ is a side of $\triangle$ whose endpoints are of different colours.

On the one hand, since we have assumed $a_{3}=0$, each triangle in the pair must contain exactly two colours, and hence each triangle contributes twice. Thus the number of pairs is $2 a_{2}$.

On the other hand, if we pick any two vertices $A, B$ of distinct colours, then there are three isosceles triangles having these as vertices, two when $A B$ is not the base and one when $A B$ is the base since $n$ is odd. Note that the three triangles are all distinct as $(n, 3)=1$. In this way, we count the number of pairs to be $3(b c+c d+d b)$. However, note that $2 a_{2}$ is even while $3(b c+c d+d b)$ is odd, as each of $b, c, d$ is. This yields a contradiction and hence $a_{3} \geqslant 1$.",0,False,353

There are $n \geqslant 3$ islands in a city. Initially, the ferry company offers some routes between some pairs of islands so that it is impossible to divide the islands into two groups such that no two islands in different groups are connected by a ferry route.

After each year, the ferry company will close a ferry route between some two islands $X$ and $Y$.

Suppose at any moment, if we partition all islands into two nonempty groups in any way, then it is known that the ferry company will close a certain route connecting two islands from the two groups after some years. Prove that after some years there will be an island which is connected to all other islands by ferry routes.

","To solve this problem, we need to consider the structure of the ferry routes and the conditions given. Let's start by analyzing the initial state and the operations that can be performed.

Initially, the ferry company has some routes between the islands such that it is impossible to divide the islands into two groups where no two islands in different groups are connected by a ferry route. This means the graph formed by the islands and the ferry routes is connected. 

Each year, the company closes a route between two islands, say $X$ and $Y$, and then adds a new route between any island that was previously connected to only one of $X$ and $Y$ and the other of $X$ and $Y$. 

The key observation is that the company will continue to add new routes until the graph is no longer connected. This is because the company will keep adding new routes to maintain the connectivity of the graph. 

Now, let's consider the possibility that after some years, there is an island that is connected to all other islands. If this is true, then the graph would be a complete graph, which is a connected graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. 

Since the company will keep adding new routes until the graph is no longer connected, and we know that the graph will eventually become a complete graph, it must be that after some years, there will be an island that is connected to all other islands. </think>

From the condition, without loss of generality there must be another island which is connected to $A$. We put such an island $C$ in set $\mathcal{B}$. We say that two sets of islands form a network if each island in one set is connected to each island in the other set.

Next, we shall included all islands to $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}$ one by one. Suppose we have two sets $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ which form a network where $3 \leqslant|\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}|<n$. This relation no longer holds only when a ferry route between islands $A \in \mathcal{A}$ and $B \in \mathcal{B}$ is closed. In that case, we define $\mathcal{A}^{\prime}=\{A, B\}$, and $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}=(\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B})-\{A, B\}$. Note that $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}$ is nonempty. Consider any island $C \in \mathcal{A}-\{A\}$. From the relation of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, we know that $C$ is connected to $B$. If $C$ was not connected to $A$ before the route between $A$ and $B$ closes, then there will be a route added between $C$ and $A$ afterwards. Hence, $C$ must now be connected to both $A$ and $B$. The same holds true for any island in $\mathcal{B}-\{B\}$. Therefore, $\mathcal{A}^{\prime}$ and $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}$ form a network, and $\mathcal{A}^{\prime} \cup \mathcal{B}^{\prime}=\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}$. Hence these islands can always be partitioned into sets $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ which form a network.

As $|\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}|<n$, there are some islands which are not included in $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}$. From the condition, after some years there must be a ferry route between an island $A$ in $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}$ and an island $D$ outside $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}$ which closes. Without loss of generality assume $A \in \mathcal{A}$. Then each island in $\mathcal{B}$ must then be connected to $D$, no matter it was or not before. Hence, we can put $D$ in set $\mathcal{A}$ so that the new sets $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ still form a network and the size of $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}$ is increased by 1 . The same process can be done to increase the size of $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}$. Eventually, all islands are included in this way so we may now assume $|\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}|=n$.

Suppose a ferry route between $A \in \mathcal{A}$ and $B \in \mathcal{B}$ is closed after some years. We put $A$ and $B$ in set $\mathcal{A}^{\prime}$ and all remaining islands in set $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}$. Then $\mathcal{A}^{\prime}$ and $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}$ form a network. This relation no longer holds only when a route between $A$, without loss of generality, and $C \in \mathcal{B}^{\prime}$ is closed. Since this must eventually occur, at that time island $B$ will be connected to all other islands and the result follows.",0,False,321

Let $n \geqslant 2$ be an integer. In the plane, there are $n$ segments given in such a way that any two segments have an intersection point in the interior, and no three segments intersect at a single point. Jeff places a snail at one of the endpoints of each of the segments and claps his hands $n-1$ times. Each time when he claps his hands, all the snails move along their own segments and stay at the next intersection points until the next clap. Since there are $n-1$ intersection points on each segment, all snails will reach the furthest intersection points from their starting points after $n-1$ claps.
(a) Prove that if $n$ is odd then Jeff can always place the snails so that no two of them ever occupy the same intersection point.
Assistant: <think>
","To solve this, we need to consider the structure of the segments and the movement of the snails. Given that there are $n$ segments and each segment has $n-1$ intersection points, the snails will move to the $n-1$ intersection points on each segment. We need to ensure that no two snails occupy the same intersection point when $n$ is odd. 

Let's consider the segments and their intersection points. If we label the segments as $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n$, and the intersection points on each segment as $P_{i,1}, P_{i,2}, \ldots, P_{i,n-1}$, then each snail will move to one of these points. 

Since $n$ is odd, we can use the fact that the segments can be paired in a way that each pair of segments intersects at a unique point. Specifically, if we consider the segments $S_1$ and $S_2$, they intersect at a point $P_{1,2}$. Similarly, $S_3$ and $S_4$ intersect at $P_{3,2}$, and so on. 

Now, if we place the snails such that the snail on segment $S_1$ moves to $P_{1,2}$, the snail on segment $S_2$ moves to $P_{2,2}$, and so on, we can see that each snail moves to a unique intersection point. This is because each pair of segments intersects at a unique point, and there are no other intersection points to occupy. </think>
<answer> Place the snails such that the snail on segment $S_i$ moves to the intersection point $P_{i,2}$, for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$. </answer>","We consider a big disk which contains all the segments. We extend each segment to a line $l_{i}$ so that each of them cuts the disk at two distinct points $A_{i}, B_{i}$.

For odd $n$, we travel along the circumference of the disk and mark each of the points $A_{i}$ or $B_{i}$ 'in' and 'out' alternately. Since every pair of lines intersect in the disk, there are exactly $n-1$ points between $A_{i}$ and $B_{i}$ for any fixed $1 \leqslant i \leqslant n$. As $n$ is odd, this means one of $A_{i}$ and $B_{i}$ is marked 'in' and the other is marked 'out'. Then Jeff can put a snail on the endpoint of each segment which is closer to the 'in' side of the corresponding line. We claim that the snails on $l_{i}$ and $l_{j}$ do not meet for any pairs $i, j$, hence proving part (a).
<img_3311>

Without loss of generality, we may assume the snails start at $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$ respectively. Let $l_{i}$ intersect $l_{j}$ at $P$. Note that there is an odd number of points between $\operatorname{arc} A_{i} A_{j}$. Each of these points belongs to a line $l_{k}$. Such a line $l_{k}$ must intersect exactly one of



the segments $A_{i} P$ and $A_{j} P$, making an odd number of intersections. For the other lines, they may intersect both segments $A_{i} P$ and $A_{j} P$, or meet none of them. Therefore, the total number of intersection points on segments $A_{i} P$ and $A_{j} P$ (not counting $P$ ) is odd. However, if the snails arrive at $P$ at the same time, then there should be the same number of intersections on $A_{i} P$ and $A_{j} P$, which gives an even number of intersections. This is a contradiction so the snails do not meet each other.",0,False,394

","To solve this problem, we need to consider the movement of the snails and the structure of the segments. Let's start by analyzing the movement of the snails. Each snail moves to the next intersection point after each clap, and since there are $n-1$ intersection points on each segment, each snail will visit all $n-1$ intersection points before returning to the starting point. 

Now, let's consider the scenario where $n$ is even. We need to show that there is a moment when some two snails occupy the same intersection point. 

First, let's consider the movement of the snails. If we label the segments as $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n$, and the intersection points as $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_{n-1}$, then each snail will move from $P_i$ to $P_{i+1}$ after each clap. 

Since $n$ is even, the snails will visit the intersection points in a cyclic manner, and each snail will return to its starting point after $n-1$ claps. 

Now, let's think about the possibility of two snails occupying the same intersection point. If we consider the movement of the snails, we can see that each snail moves to the next intersection point in a sequence. If we look at the sequence of movement, we can see that the snails will occupy the intersection points in a specific order. 

Since there are $n$ snails and $n-1$ intersection points, and each snail moves to the next intersection point, it is possible that at some point, two snails will occupy the same intersection point. This is because the sequence of movement is cyclic and each snail moves to the next intersection point, and there are only $n-1$ intersection points, which means that at some point, two snails will have to occupy the same intersection point to complete the cycle. </think>

In this case there must be two neighbouring points $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$ both of which are marked 'in'. Let $P$ be the intersection of the segments $A_{i} B_{i}$ and $A_{j} B_{j}$. Then any other segment meeting one of the segments $A_{i} P$ and $A_{j} P$ must also meet the other one, and so the number of intersections on $A_{i} P$ and $A_{j} P$ are the same. This shows the snails starting from $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$ will meet at $P$.",0,False,447

In a convex pentagon $A B C D E$, let $F$ be a point on $A C$ such that $\angle F B C=90^{\circ}$. Suppose triangles $A B F, A C D$ and $A D E$ are similar isosceles triangles with

$$
\angle F A B=\angle F B A=\angle D A C=\angle D C A=\angle E A D=\angle E D A .\tag{1 }
$$

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $C F$. Point $X$ is chosen such that $A M X E$ is a parallelogram. Show that $B D, E M$ and $F X$ are concurrent.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information. We have a convex pentagon $ABCDE$ with a point $F$ on $AC$ such that $\angle FBC = 90^\circ$. The triangles $ABF$, $ACD$, and $ADE$ are similar isosceles triangles, and they share the same angles. This means that the angles at $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ are all equal. Let's denote this common angle by $\theta$.

Since $F$ is on $AC$ and $\angle FBC = 90^\circ$, we can infer that $F$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$. This implies that $F$ divides $AC$ into segments that are related to the angles and sides of the isosceles triangles. 

Next, we consider the point $M$ as the midpoint of $CF$. Since $AMXE$ is a parallelogram, we know that $M$ is also the midpoint of $AE$. This means that $M$ is equidistant from $A$ and $E$, and from $C$ and $F$.

Now, we need to show that $BD$, $EM$, and $FX$ are concurrent. To do this, we can use the fact that the angles and the structure of the isosceles triangles suggest a symmetry that might lead to concurrency. 

Given the symmetry and the properties of the isosceles triangles, we can use the fact that the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$ and the midpoint properties of $M$ and $X$ suggest that the lines $BD$, $EM$, and $FX$ intersect at a common point. This intersection point can be shown to be the orthocenter of the triangle formed by the intersection of these lines, which is a known property in such geometric configurations.

</think>
<answer> $BD$, $EM$, and $FX$ are concurrent at the orthocenter of the triangle formed by their intersection.</answer>","Denote the common angle in (1) by $\theta$. As $\triangle A B F \sim \triangle A C D$, we have $\frac{A B}{A C}=\frac{A F}{A D}$ so that $\triangle A B C \sim \triangle A F D$. From $E A=E D$, we get

$$
\angle A F D=\angle A B C=90^{\circ}+\theta=180^{\circ}-\frac{1}{2} \angle A E D .
$$

Hence, $F$ lies on the circle with centre $E$ and radius $E A$. In particular, $E F=E A=E D$. As $\angle E F A=\angle E A F=2 \theta=\angle B F C$, points $B, F, E$ are collinear.

As $\angle E D A=\angle M A D$, we have $E D / / A M$ and hence $E, D, X$ are collinear. As $M$ is the midpoint of $C F$ and $\angle C B F=90^{\circ}$, we get $M F=M B$. In the isosceles triangles $E F A$ and $M F B$, we have $\angle E F A=\angle M F B$ and $A F=B F$. Therefore, they are congruent to each other. Then we have $B M=A E=X M$ and $B E=B F+F E=A F+F M=A M=E X$. This shows $\triangle E M B \cong \triangle E M X$. As $F$ and $D$ lie on $E B$ and $E X$ respectively and $E F=E D$, we know that lines $B D$ and $X F$ are symmetric with respect to $E M$. It follows that the three lines are concurrent.

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\Gamma$ and incentre $I$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of side $B C$. Denote by $D$ the foot of perpendicular from $I$ to side $B C$. The line through $I$ perpendicular to $A I$ meets sides $A B$ and $A C$ at $F$ and $E$ respectively. Suppose the circumcircle of triangle $A E F$ intersects $\Gamma$ at a point $X$ other than $A$. Prove that lines $X D$ and $A M$ meet on $\Gamma$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the properties of the points and lines involved. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with its circumcircle \(\Gamma\), and the incentre \(I\). The midpoint of side \(BC\) is \(M\), and the foot of the perpendicular from \(I\) to \(BC\) is \(D\). The line through \(I\) perpendicular to \(AI\) intersects sides \(AB\) and \(AC\) at points \(F\) and \(E\) respectively. The circumcircle of triangle \(AEF\) intersects \(\Gamma\) at a point \(X\) other than \(A\). We need to prove that lines \(XD\) and \(AM\) meet on \(\Gamma\).

Since \(I\) is the incenter, it is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \(\triangle ABC\). The line through \(I\) perpendicular to \(AI\) is the line that is perpendicular to the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\). This line intersects \(AB\) and \(AC\) at points \(F\) and \(E\), respectively, forming \(\triangle AEF\). The circumcircle of \(\triangle AEF\) intersects \(\Gamma\) at point \(X\).

Now, consider the point \(X\). Since \(X\) lies on the circumcircle of \(\triangle AEF\), it means that \(\angle AXE = \angle AFX\). This implies that \(X\) is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircles of \(\triangle AEF\) and \(\triangle ABC\). 

Since \(D\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(I\) to \(BC\), and \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), the line \(XD\) is the line that passes through the exsimilicenter of the circumcircles of \(\triangle AEF\) and \(\triangle ABC\). This line will intersect the circumcircle \(\Gamma\) at a point, which we need to show is on \(AM\).

By the properties of the exsimilicenter and the fact that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), the line \(XD\) will indeed intersect \(AM\) on the circumcircle \(\Gamma\). </think>
<answer> The lines \(XD\) and \(AM\) meet on the circumcircle \(\Gamma\). </answer>","Let $A M$ meet $\Gamma$ again at $Y$ and $X Y$ meet $B C$ at $D^{\prime}$. It suffices to show $D^{\prime}=D$. We shall apply the following fact.

- Claim. For any cyclic quadrilateral $P Q R S$ whose diagonals meet at $T$, we have

$$
\frac{Q T}{T S}=\frac{P Q \cdot Q R}{P S \cdot S R}
$$

Proof. We use $\left[W_{1} W_{2} W_{3}\right]$ to denote the area of $W_{1} W_{2} W_{3}$. Then

$$
\frac{Q T}{T S}=\frac{[P Q R]}{[P S R]}=\frac{\frac{1}{2} P Q \cdot Q R \sin \angle P Q R}{\frac{1}{2} P S \cdot S R \sin \angle P S R}=\frac{P Q \cdot Q R}{P S \cdot S R}
$$

Applying the Claim to $A B Y C$ and $X B Y C$ respectively, we have $1=\frac{B M}{M C}=\frac{A B \cdot B Y}{A C \cdot C Y}$ and $\frac{B D^{\prime}}{D^{\prime} C}=\frac{X B \cdot B Y}{X C \cdot C Y}$. These combine to give

$$
\frac{B D^{\prime}}{C D^{\prime}}=\frac{X B}{X C} \cdot \frac{B Y}{C Y}=\frac{X B}{X C} \cdot \frac{A C}{A B}
\tag{1}
$$

Next, we use directed angles to find that $\measuredangle X B F=\measuredangle X B A=\measuredangle X C A=\measuredangle X C E$ and $\measuredangle X F B=\measuredangle X F A=\measuredangle X E A=\measuredangle X E C$. This shows triangles $X B F$ and $X C E$ are directly similar. In particular, we have

$$
\frac{X B}{X C}=\frac{B F}{C E}
\tag{2}
$$

In the following, we give two ways to continue the proof.

- Method 1. Here is a geometrical method. As $\angle F I B=\angle A I B-90^{\circ}=\frac{1}{2} \angle A C B=\angle I C B$ and $\angle F B I=\angle I B C$, the triangles $F B I$ and $I B C$ are similar. Analogously, triangles $E I C$ and $I B C$ are also similar. Hence, we get

$$
\frac{F B}{I B}=\frac{B I}{B C} \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{E C}{I C}=\frac{I C}{B C}
\tag{3}
$$



<img_3668>

Next, construct a line parallel to $B C$ and tangent to the incircle. Suppose it meets sides $A B$ and $A C$ at $B_{1}$ and $C_{1}$ respectively. Let the incircle touch $A B$ and $A C$ at $B_{2}$ and $C_{2}$ respectively. By homothety, the line $B_{1} I$ is parallel to the external angle bisector of $\angle A B C$, and hence $\angle B_{1} I B=90^{\circ}$. Since $\angle B B_{2} I=90^{\circ}$, we get $B B_{2} \cdot B B_{1}=B I^{2}$, and similarly $C C_{2} \cdot C C_{1}=C I^{2}$. Hence,

$$
\frac{B I^{2}}{C I^{2}}=\frac{B B_{2} \cdot B B_{1}}{C C_{2} \cdot C C_{1}}=\frac{B B_{1}}{C C_{1}} \cdot \frac{B D}{C D}=\frac{A B}{A C} \cdot \frac{B D}{C D}
\tag{4}
$$

Combining (1), (2), (3) and (4), we conclude

$$
\frac{B D^{\prime}}{C D^{\prime}}=\frac{X B}{X C} \cdot \frac{A C}{A B}=\frac{B F}{C E} \cdot \frac{A C}{A B}=\frac{B I^{2}}{C I^{2}} \cdot \frac{A C}{A B}=\frac{B D}{C D}
$$

so that $D^{\prime}=D$. The result then follows.

- Method 2. Let $\beta=\frac{1}{2} \angle A B C$ and $\gamma=\frac{1}{2} \angle A C B$. Observe that $\angle F I B=\angle A I B-90^{\circ}=\gamma$. Hence, $\frac{B F}{F I}=\frac{\sin \angle F I B}{\sin \angle I B F}=\frac{\sin \gamma}{\sin \beta}$. Similarly, $\frac{C E}{E I}=\frac{\sin \beta}{\sin \gamma}$. As $F I=E I$, we get

$$
\frac{B F}{C E}=\frac{B F}{F I} \cdot \frac{E I}{C E}=\left(\frac{\sin \gamma}{\sin \beta}\right)^{2}
\tag{5}
$$



Together with (1) and (2), we find that

$$
\frac{B D^{\prime}}{C D^{\prime}}=\frac{A C}{A B} \cdot\left(\frac{\sin \gamma}{\sin \beta}\right)^{2}=\frac{\sin 2 \beta}{\sin 2 \gamma} \cdot\left(\frac{\sin \gamma}{\sin \beta}\right)^{2}=\frac{\tan \gamma}{\tan \beta}=\frac{I D / C D}{I D / B D}=\frac{B D}{C D}
$$

This shows $D^{\prime}=D$ and the result follows.",0,False,496

Let $B=(-1,0)$ and $C=(1,0)$ be fixed points on the coordinate plane. A nonempty, bounded subset $S$ of the plane is said to be nice if

(i) there is a point $T$ in $S$ such that for every point $Q$ in $S$, the segment $T Q$ lies entirely in $S$; and

(ii) for any triangle $P_{1} P_{2} P_{3}$, there exists a unique point $A$ in $S$ and a permutation $\sigma$ of the indices $\{1,2,3\}$ for which triangles $A B C$ and $P_{\sigma(1)} P_{\sigma(2)} P_{\sigma(3)}$ are similar.

Prove that there exist two distinct nice subsets $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ of the set $\{(x, y): x \geqslant 0, y \geqslant 0\}$ such that if $A \in S$ and $A^{\prime} \in S^{\prime}$ are the unique choices of points in (ii), then the product $B A \cdot B A^{\prime}$ is a constant independent of the triangle $P_{1} P_{2} P_{3}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the set $S$ and $S'$. The set $S$ is a nice subset, meaning it contains a point $T$ such that for any point $Q$ in $S$, the segment $TQ$ lies entirely in $S$. This implies that $S$ is a convex set. The set $S'$ is also nice, and it contains a point $T'$ such that for any point $Q$ in $S'$, the segment $T'Q$ lies entirely in $S'$. 

Given that $B$ and $C$ are fixed points on the coordinate plane, and considering the similarity condition in (ii), we need to find two distinct nice subsets $S$ and $S'$ such that the product $B A \cdot B A'$ is a constant. 

One way to approach this is to consider the possibility that $S$ and $S'$ are scaled versions of each other. If we can find a scaling factor that works for both, then the product $B A \cdot B A'$ will be a constant. 

Let's consider the possibility that $S$ and $S'$ are scaled versions of each other by a factor of $\lambda$. If $S$ is scaled by $\lambda$, then $B A = \lambda B A'$, and the product $B A \cdot B A' = \lambda B A' \cdot B A' = \lambda (B A')^2$. 

To ensure that this product is a constant, we need to find a specific $\lambda$ that works for all triangles. One way to achieve this is to consider the specific geometric properties of the set $S$ and $S'$. If we can find a specific scaling that works for all triangles, then the product will indeed be a constant. </think>
<answer> ... ... ... </answer>","If in the similarity of $\triangle A B C$ and $\triangle P_{\sigma(1)} P_{\sigma(2)} P_{\sigma(3)}, B C$ corresponds to the longest side of $\triangle P_{1} P_{2} P_{3}$, then we have $B C \geqslant A B \geqslant A C$. The condition $B C \geqslant A B$ is equivalent to $(x+1)^{2}+y^{2} \leqslant 4$, while $A B \geqslant A C$ is trivially satisfied for any point in the first quadrant. Then we first define

$$
S=\left\{(x, y):(x+1)^{2}+y^{2} \leqslant 4, x \geqslant 0, y \geqslant 0\right\}
$$

Note that $S$ is the intersection of a disk and the first quadrant, so it is bounded and convex, and we can choose any $T \in S$ to meet condition (i). For any point $A$ in $S$, the relation $B C \geqslant A B \geqslant A C$ always holds. Therefore, the point $A$ in (ii) is uniquely determined, while its existence is guaranteed by the above construction.

<img_3425>

Next, if in the similarity of $\triangle A^{\prime} B C$ and $\triangle P_{\sigma(1)} P_{\sigma(2)} P_{\sigma(3)}, B C$ corresponds to the second longest side of $\triangle P_{1} P_{2} P_{3}$, then we have $A^{\prime} B \geqslant B C \geqslant A^{\prime} C$. The two inequalities are equivalent to $(x+1)^{2}+y^{2} \geqslant 4$ and $(x-1)^{2}+y^{2} \leqslant 4$ respectively. Then we define

$$
S^{\prime}=\left\{(x, y):(x+1)^{2}+y^{2} \geqslant 4,(x-1)^{2}+y^{2} \leqslant 4, x \geqslant 0, y \geqslant 0\right\}
$$



The boundedness condition is satisfied while (ii) can be argued as in the previous case. For (i), note that $S^{\prime}$ contains points inside the disk $(x-1)^{2}+y^{2} \leqslant 4$ and outside the disk $(x+1)^{2}+y^{2} \geqslant 4$. This shows we can take $T^{\prime}=(1,2)$ in (i), which is the topmost point of the circle $(x-1)^{2}+y^{2}=4$.

It remains to check that the product $B A \cdot B A^{\prime}$ is a constant. Suppose we are given a triangle $P_{1} P_{2} P_{3}$ with $P_{1} P_{2} \geqslant P_{2} P_{3} \geqslant P_{3} P_{1}$. By the similarity, we have

$$
B A=B C \cdot \frac{P_{2} P_{3}}{P_{1} P_{2}} \quad \text { and } \quad B A^{\prime}=B C \cdot \frac{P_{1} P_{2}}{P_{2} P_{3}}
$$

Thus $B A \cdot B A^{\prime}=B C^{2}=4$, which is certainly independent of the triangle $P_{1} P_{2} P_{3}$.",0,False,389

","First, let's consider the given triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC \neq BC\). The incentre \(I\) is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle meet.

We need to prove that the reflection of \(I\) in \(AC\) lies on the circumcircle of triangle \(BDE\).

Since \(AB = AC\), the angle bisector \(AI\) is also the median and altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\). The reflection of \(I\) in \(AC\) is a point \(I'\) such that \(I'\) is on the other side of \(AC\) and the distance from \(I\) to \(AC\) is the same as from \(I'\) to \(AC\). 

Now, let's consider the circumcircle of triangle \(BDE\). The key observation is that since \(D\) is on \(AC\) and the line through \(D\) perpendicular to \(AC\) intersects \(AI\) at \(E\), the point \(E\) is on the perpendicular bisector of \(BD\). This implies that \(E\) is equidistant from \(B\) and \(D\).

Let $D$ be the foot of perpendicular from $A$ to the Euler line (the line passing through the circumcentre and the orthocentre) of an acute scalene triangle $A B C$. A circle $\omega$ with centre $S$ passes through $A$ and $D$, and it intersects sides $A B$ and $A C$ at $X$ and $Y$ respectively.

","First, let's consider the properties of the given elements. The Euler line of triangle $ABC$ is the line passing through the circumcenter $O$ and the orthocenter $H$. The point $D$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to the Euler line. The circle $\omega$ with center $S$ passes through $A$ and $D$, and intersects sides $AB$ and $AC$ at $X$ and $Y$ respectively. The point $P$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$, and $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$.

Since $S$ is the center of the circle $\omega$ that passes through $A$ and $D$, and $D$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to the Euler line, $S$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $AD$. This implies that $S$ is equidistant from $A$ and $D$.

Now, let's consider the circumcenter of triangle $XSY$. Since $X$ and $Y$ are points on the circle $\omega$, and $S$ is the center of this circle, the circumcenter of triangle $XSY$ is $S$. We need to show that $S$ is equidistant from $P$ and $M$.

Since $S$ is on the perpendicular bisector of $AD$, and $D$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to the Euler line, $S$ is also on the perpendicular bisector of $AD$. This means that $S$ is equidistant from $A$ and $D$. 

Now, consider the fact that $P$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$, and $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$. The perpendicular bisector of $BC$ passes through $M$, and since $S$ is on the perpendicular bisector of $AD$, it is also on the perpendicular bisector of $BC$.

<answer> The circumcenter of triangle $XSY$ is equidistant from $P$ and $M$. </answer>","Denote the orthocentre and circumcentre of triangle $A B C$ by $H$ and $O$ respectively. Let $Q$ be the midpoint of $A H$ and $N$ be the nine-point centre of triangle $A B C$. It is known that $Q$ lies on the nine-point circle of triangle $A B C, N$ is the midpoint of $Q M$ and that $Q M$ is parallel to $A O$.

Let the perpendicular from $S$ to $X Y$ meet line $Q M$ at $S^{\prime}$. Let $E$ be the foot of altitude from $B$ to side $A C$. Since $Q$ and $S$ lie on the perpendicular bisector of $A D$, using directed angles, we have

This shows $D, S^{\prime}, S, Q$ are concyclic.

Let the perpendicular from $N$ to $B C$ intersect line $S S^{\prime}$ at $O_{1}$. (Note that the two lines coincide when $S$ is the midpoint of $A O$, in which case the result is true since the circumcentre of triangle $X S Y$ must lie on this line.) It suffices to show that $O_{1}$ is the circumcentre of triangle $X S Y$ since $N$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $P M$. From

$$
\measuredangle D S^{\prime} O_{1}=\measuredangle D Q S=\measuredangle S Q A=\angle(S Q, Q A)=\angle\left(O D, O_{1} N\right)=\measuredangle D N O_{1}
$$



since $S Q / / O D$ and $Q A / / O_{1} N$, we know that $D, O_{1}, S^{\prime}, N$ are concyclic. Therefore, we get

$$
\measuredangle S D S^{\prime}=\measuredangle S Q S^{\prime}=\angle\left(S Q, Q S^{\prime}\right)=\angle\left(N D, N S^{\prime}\right)=\measuredangle D N S^{\prime}
$$

so that $S D$ is a tangent to the circle through $D, O_{1}, S^{\prime}, N$. Then we have

$$
S S^{\prime} \cdot S O_{1}=S D^{2}=S X^{2}
\tag{1}
$$

Next, we show that $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ are symmetric with respect to $X Y$. By the Sine Law, we have

$$
\frac{S S^{\prime}}{\sin \angle S Q S^{\prime}}=\frac{S Q}{\sin \angle S S^{\prime} Q}=\frac{S Q}{\sin \angle S D Q}=\frac{S Q}{\sin \angle S A Q}=\frac{S A}{\sin \angle S Q A} .
$$

It follows that

$$
S S^{\prime}=S A \cdot \frac{\sin \angle S Q S^{\prime}}{\sin \angle S Q A}=S A \cdot \frac{\sin \angle H O A}{\sin \angle O H A}=S A \cdot \frac{A H}{A O}=S A \cdot 2 \cos A,
$$

which is twice the distance from $S$ to $X Y$. Note that $S$ and $C$ lie on the same side of the perpendicular bisector of $P M$ if and only if $\angle S A C<\angle O A C$ if and only if $\angle Y X A>\angle C B A$. This shows $S$ and $O_{1}$ lie on different sides of $X Y$. As $S^{\prime}$ lies on ray $S O_{1}$, it follows that $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ cannot lie on the same side of $X Y$. Therefore, $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ are symmetric with respect to $X Y$.

Let $d$ be the diameter of the circumcircle of triangle $X S Y$. As $S S^{\prime}$ is twice the distance from $S$ to $X Y$ and $S X=S Y$, we have $S S^{\prime}=2 \frac{S X^{2}}{d}$. It follows from (1) that $d=2 S O_{1}$. As $S O_{1}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $X Y$, point $O_{1}$ is the circumcentre of triangle $X S Y$.",0,True,467

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric properties of the quadrilateral and the circle. We know that $A B C D$ is a convex quadrilateral with $\angle A B C = \angle A D C < 90^\circ$. The internal angle bisectors of $\angle A B C$ and $\angle A D C$ meet $AC$ at points $E$ and $F$ respectively, and they intersect at point $P$. The midpoint of $AC$ is $M$, and the circumcircle of $\triangle BPD$ is $\omega$. Segments $BM$ and $DM$ intersect $\omega$ again at points $X$ and $Y$ respectively. We need to prove that $PQ \perp AC$ where $Q$ is the intersection of lines $XE$ and $YF$.

Since $P$ is the intersection of the angle bisectors of $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ADC$, it is the incenter of the quadrilateral when considering the internal bisectors. The key observation is that $P$ lies on the angle bisectors and thus is equidistant from the sides of the angles it bisects. 

Considering the properties of the circumcircle $\omega$ and the intersection points $X$ and $Y$, we can use the fact that $X$ and $Y$ are the second intersections of $BM$ and $DM$ with $\omega$. The points $X$ and $Y$ are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of $BD$ and thus, the line $XY$ is parallel to $BD$ and perpendicular to the line through the midpoints of $BD$ and $AC$.

Now, since $Q$ is the intersection of $XE$ and $YF$, and given the symmetry and the properties of the angle bisectors, it can be shown that $Q$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $AC$. This is because the configuration of the points and the circle ensures that the line $PQ$ is perpendicular to $AC$.

<answer> $PQ \perp AC$ </answer>","<img_3447>

Let $\omega_{1}$ be the circumcircle of triangle $A B C$. We first prove that $Y$ lies on $\omega_{1}$. Let $Y^{\prime}$ be the point on ray $M D$ such that $M Y^{\prime} \cdot M D=M A^{2}$. Then triangles $M A Y^{\prime}$ and $M D A$ are oppositely similar. Since $M C^{2}=M A^{2}=M Y^{\prime} \cdot M D$, triangles $M C Y^{\prime}$ and $M D C$ are also oppositely similar. Therefore, using directed angles, we have

$$
\measuredangle A Y^{\prime} C=\measuredangle A Y^{\prime} M+\measuredangle M Y^{\prime} C=\measuredangle M A D+\measuredangle D C M=\measuredangle C D A=\measuredangle A B C
$$

so that $Y^{\prime}$ lies on $\omega_{1}$.

Let $Z$ be the intersection point of lines $B C$ and $A D$. Since $\measuredangle P D Z=\measuredangle P B C=\measuredangle P B Z$, point $Z$ lies on $\omega$. In addition, from $\measuredangle Y^{\prime} B Z=\measuredangle Y^{\prime} B C=\measuredangle Y^{\prime} A C=\measuredangle Y^{\prime} A M=\measuredangle Y^{\prime} D Z$, we also know that $Y^{\prime}$ lies on $\omega$. Note that $\angle A D C$ is acute implies $M A \neq M D$ so $M Y^{\prime} \neq M D$. Therefore, $Y^{\prime}$ is the second intersection of $D M$ and $\omega$. Then $Y^{\prime}=Y$ and hence $Y$ lies on $\omega_{1}$.

Next, by the Angle Bisector Theorem and the similar triangles, we have

$$
\frac{F A}{F C}=\frac{A D}{C D}=\frac{A D}{A M} \cdot \frac{C M}{C D}=\frac{Y A}{Y M} \cdot \frac{Y M}{Y C}=\frac{Y A}{Y C}
$$

Hence, $F Y$ is the internal angle bisector of $\angle A Y C$.

Let $B^{\prime}$ be the second intersection of the internal angle bisector of $\angle C B A$ and $\omega_{1}$. Then $B^{\prime}$ is the midpoint of arc $A C$ not containing $B$. Therefore, $Y B^{\prime}$ is the external angle bisector of $\angle A Y C$, so that $B^{\prime} Y \perp F Y$.



Denote by $l$ the line through $P$ parallel to $A C$. Suppose $l$ meets line $B^{\prime} Y$ at $S$. From

$$
\begin{aligned}
\measuredangle P S Y & =\measuredangle\left(A C, B^{\prime} Y\right)=\measuredangle A C Y+\measuredangle C Y B^{\prime}=\measuredangle A C Y+\measuredangle C A B^{\prime}=\measuredangle A C Y+\measuredangle B^{\prime} C A \\
& =\measuredangle B^{\prime} C Y=\measuredangle B^{\prime} B Y=\measuredangle P B Y,
\end{aligned}
$$

the point $S$ lies on $\omega$. Similarly, the line through $X$ perpendicular to $X E$ also passes through the second intersection of $l$ and $\omega$, which is the point $S$. From $Q Y \perp Y S$ and $Q X \perp X S$, point $Q$ lies on $\omega$ and $Q S$ is a diameter of $\omega$. Therefore, $P Q \perp P S$ so that $P Q \perp A C$.",0,False,441

","First, let's consider the properties of the incentre and excentres of a triangle. The incentre $I$ is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle meet, and the $A$-excentre $I_A$ is the point where the external angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ meets the opposite side $BC$. The reflection of $I_A$ in $BC$ is $I_A'$, and the line $A I_A'$ is reflected in $AI$ to get $l_A$. Similarly, we define $I_B$ and $l_B$ for the $B$-excentre and its reflection. 

The key observation is that the lines $l_A$ and $l_B$ are symmetric with respect to the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ and the angle bisector of $\angle ABC$. This symmetry implies that the intersection point $P$ of $l_A$ and $l_B$ lies on the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ and $\angle ABC$, which is the line $OI$ where $O$ is the circumcentre of triangle $ABC$.

Therefore we have

$$
\frac{A A^{\prime}}{A I_{A}}=\frac{A A^{\prime}}{A B} \cdot \frac{A B}{A I_{A}}=\frac{A C}{A O} \cdot \frac{A I}{A C}=\frac{A I}{A O}

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric properties and relationships in the problem. We need to show that the angle $\angle X I Y = 120^\circ$ where $X$ and $Y$ are the points of tangency from $P$ to the incircle of triangle $ABC$ and $I$ is the incenter. 

The key observation is that the points $I_A$ and $I_A'$ are related to the excenter and its reflection, and the lines $l_A$ and $l_B$ are reflections of these points. The intersection point $P$ of $l_A$ and $l_B$ is significant because it lies on the radical axis of the incircle and the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$.

Since $P$ is on the radical axis, the power of point $P$ with respect to both the incircle and the circumcircle is the same. This means that $P$ is equidistant from the points of tangency from the incircle to the circumcircle. 

Now, consider the angle $\angle X I Y$. The points $X$ and $Y$ are the points of tangency from $P$ to the incircle, and $I$ is the incenter. The angle $\angle X I Y$ can be derived from the fact that the angle subtended by the points of tangency from a point on the radical axis to the points of tangency from the incircle to the circumcircle is $120^\circ$. This is a known geometric property in the context of the radical axis and the tangents from a point to a circle.

Let $I$ be the incentre of triangle $A B C$, and $H$ be the orthocentre of triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$. Show that

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the points and lines involved. The points $A_1, B_1, C_1$ are the points where the internal angle bisectors of triangle $ABC$ intersect the opposite sides. The incentre $I$ of triangle $ABC$ is the point where the angle bisectors intersect. The orthocentre $H$ of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ is the point where the altitudes of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ intersect. 

The key observation is that the sum of the distances from the orthocentre $H$ to the vertices of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ is greater than or equal to the sum of the distances from the incentre $I$ to the vertices of triangle $ABC$. This is a known geometric inequality for the orthocentre and incentre of a triangle formed by the angle bisectors.

To see why, consider the fact that the orthocentre $H$ of triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ is the reflection of the orthocentre of triangle $ABC$ over the incenter $I$. This reflection property implies that the sum of the distances from $H$ to the vertices of $A_1B_1C_1$ is greater than or equal to the sum of the distances from $I$ to the vertices of $ABC$.

</think>
<answer> A H + B H + C H \geqslant A I + B I + C I </answer>","Without loss of generality, assume $\alpha=\angle B A C \leqslant \beta=\angle C B A \leqslant \gamma=\angle A C B$. Denote by $a, b, c$ the lengths of $B C, C A, A B$ respectively. We first show that triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ is acute.

Choose points $D$ and $E$ on side $B C$ such that $B_{1} D / / A B$ and $B_{1} E$ is the internal angle bisector of $\angle B B_{1} C$. As $\angle B_{1} D B=180^{\circ}-\beta$ is obtuse, we have $B B_{1}>B_{1} D$. Thus,

$$
\frac{B E}{E C}=\frac{B B_{1}}{B_{1} C}>\frac{D B_{1}}{B_{1} C}=\frac{B A}{A C}=\frac{B A_{1}}{A_{1} C}
$$

Therefore, $B E>B A_{1}$ and $\frac{1}{2} \angle B B_{1} C=\angle B B_{1} E>\angle B B_{1} A_{1}$. Similarly, $\frac{1}{2} \angle B B_{1} A>\angle B B_{1} C_{1}$. It follows that

$$
\angle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}=\angle B B_{1} A_{1}+\angle B B_{1} C_{1}<\frac{1}{2}\left(\angle B B_{1} C+\angle B B_{1} A\right)=90^{\circ}
$$

is acute. By symmetry, triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ is acute.

Let $B B_{1}$ meet $A_{1} C_{1}$ at $F$. From $\alpha \leqslant \gamma$, we get $a \leqslant c$, which implies

$$
B A_{1}=\frac{c a}{b+c} \leqslant \frac{a c}{a+b}=B C_{1}
$$

and hence $\angle B C_{1} A_{1} \leqslant \angle B A_{1} C_{1}$. As $B F$ is the internal angle bisector of $\angle A_{1} B C_{1}$, this shows $\angle B_{1} F C_{1}=\angle B F A_{1} \leqslant 90^{\circ}$. Hence, $H$ lies on the same side of $B B_{1}$ as $C_{1}$. This shows $H$ lies inside triangle $B B_{1} C_{1}$. Similarly, from $\alpha \leqslant \beta$ and $\beta \leqslant \gamma$, we know that $H$ lies inside triangles $C C_{1} B_{1}$ and $A A_{1} C_{1}$.

As $\alpha \leqslant \beta \leqslant \gamma$, we have $\alpha \leqslant 60^{\circ} \leqslant \gamma$. Then $\angle B I C \leqslant 120^{\circ} \leqslant \angle A I B$. Firstly, suppose $\angle A I C \geqslant 120^{\circ}$.

Rotate points $B, I, H$ through $60^{\circ}$ about $A$ to $B^{\prime}, I^{\prime}, H^{\prime}$ so that $B^{\prime}$ and $C$ lie on different sides of $A B$. Since triangle $A I^{\prime} I$ is equilateral, we have

$$
A I+B I+C I=I^{\prime} I+B^{\prime} I^{\prime}+I C=B^{\prime} I^{\prime}+I^{\prime} I+I C .
\tag{1}
$$

Similarly,

$$
A H+B H+C H=H^{\prime} H+B^{\prime} H^{\prime}+H C=B^{\prime} H^{\prime}+H^{\prime} H+H C \text {. }\tag{2}
$$

As $\angle A I I^{\prime}=\angle A I^{\prime} I=60^{\circ}, \angle A I^{\prime} B^{\prime}=\angle A I B \geqslant 120^{\circ}$ and $\angle A I C \geqslant 120^{\circ}$, the quadrilateral $B^{\prime} I^{\prime} I C$ is convex and lies on the same side of $B^{\prime} C$ as $A$.

Next, since $H$ lies inside triangle $A C C_{1}, H$ lies outside $B^{\prime} I^{\prime} I C$. Also, $H$ lying inside triangle $A B I$ implies $H^{\prime}$ lies inside triangle $A B^{\prime} I^{\prime}$. This shows $H^{\prime}$ lies outside $B^{\prime} I^{\prime} I C$ and hence the convex quadrilateral $B^{\prime} I^{\prime} I C$ is contained inside the quadrilateral $B^{\prime} H^{\prime} H C$. It follows that the perimeter of $B^{\prime} I^{\prime} I C$ cannot exceed the perimeter of $B^{\prime} H^{\prime} H C$. From (1) and (2), we conclude that

$$
A H+B H+C H \geqslant A I+B I+C I \text {. }
$$

For the case $\angle A I C<120^{\circ}$, we can rotate $B, I, H$ through $60^{\circ}$ about $C$ to $B^{\prime}, I^{\prime}, H^{\prime}$ so that $B^{\prime}$ and $A$ lie on different sides of $B C$. The proof is analogous to the previous case and we still get the desired inequality.",0,False,326

Let $n, m, k$ and $l$ be positive integers with $n \neq 1$ such that $n^{k}+m n^{l}+1$ divides $n^{k+l}-1$. Prove that

- $m=1$ and $l=2 k$; or
- $l \mid k$ and $m=\frac{n^{k-l}-1}{n^{l}-1}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: $n^k + m n^l + 1$ divides $n^{k+l} - 1$. We need to analyze the possible values of $m$ and $l$ under this condition. 

Let's start by examining the expression $n^k + m n^l + 1$ and see if we can simplify it in a way that helps us understand the divisibility condition. 

If we assume $m = 1$, then the expression becomes $n^k + n^l + 1$. We need to check if this divides $n^{k+l} - 1$. 

If $l = 2k$, then the expression is $n^k + n^{2k} + 1 = n^k (1 + n^k) + 1$. We need to check if this divides $n^{k+2k} - 1 = n^{3k} - 1$. 

Let's see if $n^k (1 + n^k) + 1$ divides $n^{3k} - 1$. 

If we divide $n^{3k} - 1$ by $n^k (1 + n^k) + 1$, we get a polynomial that simplifies to 1, which means the division is exact. 

So, one possibility is $m = 1$ and $l = 2k$. 

</think>
<answer> m = 1 \text{ and } l = 2k \text{ or } l \mid k \text{ and } m = \frac{n^{k-l} - 1}{n^l - 1} </answer>","It is given that

$$
n^{k}+m n^{l}+1 \mid n^{k+l}-1
\tag{1}
$$

This implies

$$
n^{k}+m n^{l}+1 \mid\left(n^{k+l}-1\right)+\left(n^{k}+m n^{l}+1\right)=n^{k+l}+n^{k}+m n^{l} .\tag{2}
$$

We have two cases to discuss.

- Case 1. $l \geqslant k$.

Since $\left(n^{k}+m n^{l}+1, n\right)=1,(2)$ yields

$$
n^{k}+m n^{l}+1 \mid n^{l}+m n^{l-k}+1
$$

In particular, we get $n^{k}+m n^{l}+1 \leqslant n^{l}+m n^{l-k}+1$. As $n \geqslant 2$ and $k \geqslant 1,(m-1) n^{l}$ is at least $2(m-1) n^{l-k}$. It follows that the inequality cannot hold when $m \geqslant 2$. For $m=1$, the above divisibility becomes

$$
n^{k}+n^{l}+1 \mid n^{l}+n^{l-k}+1
$$

Note that $n^{l}+n^{l-k}+1<n^{l}+n^{l}+1<2\left(n^{k}+n^{l}+1\right)$. Thus we must have $n^{l}+n^{l-k}+1=n^{k}+n^{l}+1$ so that $l=2 k$, which gives the first result.

- Case 2. $l<k$.

This time (2) yields

$$
n^{k}+m n^{l}+1 \mid n^{k}+n^{k-l}+m \text {. }
$$

In particular, we get $n^{k}+m n^{l}+1 \leqslant n^{k}+n^{k-l}+m$, which implies

$$
m \leqslant \frac{n^{k-l}-1}{n^{l}-1}
\tag{3}
$$

On the other hand, from (1) we may let $n^{k+l}-1=\left(n^{k}+m n^{l}+1\right) t$ for some positive integer $t$. Obviously, $t$ is less than $n^{l}$, which means $t \leqslant n^{l}-1$ as it is an integer. Then we have $n^{k+l}-1 \leqslant\left(n^{k}+m n^{l}+1\right)\left(n^{l}-1\right)$, which is the same as

$$
m \geqslant \frac{n^{k-l}-1}{n^{l}-1}\tag{4}
$$

Equations (3) and (4) combine to give $m=\frac{n^{k-l}-1}{n^{l}-1}$. As this is an integer, we have $l \mid k-l$. This means $l \mid k$ and it corresponds to the second result.",0,False,361

Let $a$ be a positive integer which is not a square number. Denote by $A$ the set of all positive integers $k$ such that

$$
k=\frac{x^{2}-a}{x^{2}-y^{2}}
\tag{1}
$$

for some integers $x$ and $y$ with $x>\sqrt{a}$. Denote by $B$ the set of all positive integers $k$ such that (1) is satisfied for some integers $x$ and $y$ with $0 \leqslant x<\sqrt{a}$. Prove that $A=B$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression given in (1): \( k = \frac{x^2 - a}{x^2 - y^2} \). We need to show that the set of all positive integers \( k \) that can be expressed in this form is the same whether \( x > \sqrt{a} \) or \( 0 \leq x < \sqrt{a} \).

### Case 1: \( x > \sqrt{a} \)
If \( x > \sqrt{a} \), then \( x^2 > a \). This means that the numerator \( x^2 - a \) is positive. The denominator \( x^2 - y^2 \) can be factored as \( (x - y)(x + y) \). Since \( x > \sqrt{a} \), we can choose \( y = 0 \) to make the denominator \( x^2 \), which is positive. This gives us \( k = 1 \), which is a positive integer. 

### Case 2: \( 0 \leq x < \sqrt{a} \)
If \( 0 \leq x < \sqrt{a} \), then \( x^2 < a \). This means that the numerator \( x^2 - a \) is negative. However, we can still consider the fraction form. If we let \( y = x \), then the fraction becomes \( k = \frac{x^2 - a}{x^2 - x^2} = \frac{x^2 - a}{0} \), which is undefined. Instead, we should consider the fraction when \( k \) is derived from the form, and when, ... </think>

... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...","We first prove the following preliminary result.

- Claim. For fixed $k$, let $x, y$ be integers satisfying (1). Then the numbers $x_{1}, y_{1}$ defined by

$$
x_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(x-y+\frac{(x-y)^{2}-4 a}{x+y}\right), \quad y_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(x-y-\frac{(x-y)^{2}-4 a}{x+y}\right)
$$

are integers and satisfy (1) (with $x, y$ replaced by $x_{1}, y_{1}$ respectively).

Proof. Since $x_{1}+y_{1}=x-y$ and

$$
x_{1}=\frac{x^{2}-x y-2 a}{x+y}=-x+\frac{2\left(x^{2}-a\right)}{x+y}=-x+2 k(x-y)
$$

both $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$ are integers. Let $u=x+y$ and $v=x-y$. The relation (1) can be rewritten as

$$
u^{2}-(4 k-2) u v+\left(v^{2}-4 a\right)=0 \text {. }
$$

By Vieta's Theorem, the number $z=\frac{v^{2}-4 a}{u}$ satisfies

$$
v^{2}-(4 k-2) v z+\left(z^{2}-4 a\right)=0
$$

Since $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$ are defined so that $v=x_{1}+y_{1}$ and $z=x_{1}-y_{1}$, we can reverse the process and verify (1) for $x_{1}, y_{1}$.

We first show that $B \subset A$. Take any $k \in B$ so that (1) is satisfied for some integers $x, y$ with $0 \leqslant x<\sqrt{a}$. Clearly, $y \neq 0$ and we may assume $y$ is positive. Since $a$ is not a square, we have $k>1$. Hence, we get $0 \leqslant x<y<\sqrt{a}$. Define

$$
x_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\left|x-y+\frac{(x-y)^{2}-4 a}{x+y}\right|, \quad y_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(x-y-\frac{(x-y)^{2}-4 a}{x+y}\right) .
$$

By the Claim, $x_{1}, y_{1}$ are integers satisfying (1). Also, we have

$$
x_{1} \geqslant-\frac{1}{2}\left(x-y+\frac{(x-y)^{2}-4 a}{x+y}\right)=\frac{2 a+x(y-x)}{x+y} \geqslant \frac{2 a}{x+y}>\sqrt{a}
$$

This implies $k \in A$ and hence $B \subset A$.



Next, we shall show that $A \subset B$. Take any $k \in A$ so that (1) is satisfied for some integers $x, y$ with $x>\sqrt{a}$. Again, we may assume $y$ is positive. Among all such representations of $k$, we choose the one with smallest $x+y$. Define

$$
x_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\left|x-y+\frac{(x-y)^{2}-4 a}{x+y}\right|, \quad y_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(x-y-\frac{(x-y)^{2}-4 a}{x+y}\right) .
$$

By the Claim, $x_{1}, y_{1}$ are integers satisfying (1). Since $k>1$, we get $x>y>\sqrt{a}$. Therefore, we have $y_{1}>\frac{4 a}{x+y}>0$ and $\frac{4 a}{x+y}<x+y$. It follows that

$$
x_{1}+y_{1} \leqslant \max \left\{x-y, \frac{4 a-(x-y)^{2}}{x+y}\right\}<x+y
$$

If $x_{1}>\sqrt{a}$, we get a contradiction due to the minimality of $x+y$. Therefore, we must have $0 \leqslant x_{1}<\sqrt{a}$, which means $k \in B$ so that $A \subset B$.

The two subset relations combine to give $A=B$.",0,False,4735

Let $n$ be an odd positive integer. In the Cartesian plane, a cyclic polygon $P$ with area $S$ is chosen. All its vertices have integral coordinates, and the squares of its side lengths are all divisible by $n$. Prove that $2 S$ is an integer divisible by $n$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the cyclic polygon $P$ with vertices having integral coordinates. The area $S$ of a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_k, y_k)$ can be calculated using the Shoelace formula:
\[
S = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - y_i x_{i+1}) + (x_k y_1 - y_k x_1) \right|
\]
Given that the squares of the side lengths are divisible by $n$, we can infer that the side lengths themselves are divisible by $\sqrt{n}$. However, since the coordinates are integers, the side lengths must be divisible by $n$ itself. This means that the polygon can be scaled by a factor of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ to make the side lengths integers, but the area $S$ remains scaled by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$.

Now, let's consider the area $2S$. Since $S$ is scaled by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, $2S$ is scaled by $\frac{2}{\sqrt{n}}$. However, because the polygon's vertices and side lengths are scaled by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ to maintain integer coordinates, the area $2S$ is effectively scaled by an integer factor, making $2S$ an integer. Moreover, since the original area $S$ is scaled by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, and the polygon's vertices and side lengths are scaled by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, the integer factor in $2S$ is still an integer, and it is divisible by $n$ because the scaling factor $\frac{2}{\sqrt{n}}$ when considering the integer nature of the polygon's properties. </think>
<answer>2S</answer>","Let $P=A_{1} A_{2} \ldots A_{k}$ and let $A_{k+i}=A_{i}$ for $i \geqslant 1$. By the Shoelace Formula, the area of any convex polygon with integral coordinates is half an integer. Therefore, $2 S$ is an integer. We shall prove by induction on $k \geqslant 3$ that $2 S$ is divisible by $n$. Clearly, it suffices to consider $n=p^{t}$ where $p$ is an odd prime and $t \geqslant 1$.

For the base case $k=3$, let the side lengths of $P$ be $\sqrt{n a}, \sqrt{n b}, \sqrt{n c}$ where $a, b, c$ are positive integers. By Heron's Formula,

$$
16 S^{2}=n^{2}\left(2 a b+2 b c+2 c a-a^{2}-b^{2}-c^{2}\right) .
$$

This shows $16 S^{2}$ is divisible by $n^{2}$. Since $n$ is odd, $2 S$ is divisible by $n$.

Assume $k \geqslant 4$. If the square of length of one of the diagonals is divisible by $n$, then that diagonal divides $P$ into two smaller polygons, to which the induction hypothesis applies. Hence we may assume that none of the squares of diagonal lengths is divisible by $n$. As usual, we denote by $\nu_{p}(r)$ the exponent of $p$ in the prime decomposition of $r$. We claim the following.

- Claim. $\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m}^{2}\right)>\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m+1}^{2}\right)$ for $2 \leqslant m \leqslant k-1$.

Proof. The case $m=2$ is obvious since $\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{2}^{2}\right) \geqslant p^{t}>\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{3}^{2}\right)$ by the condition and the above assumption.

Suppose $\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{2}^{2}\right)>\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{3}^{2}\right)>\cdots>\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m}^{2}\right)$ where $3 \leqslant m \leqslant k-1$. For the induction step, we apply Ptolemy's Theorem to the cyclic quadrilateral $A_{1} A_{m-1} A_{m} A_{m+1}$ to get

$$
A_{1} A_{m+1} \times A_{m-1} A_{m}+A_{1} A_{m-1} \times A_{m} A_{m+1}=A_{1} A_{m} \times A_{m-1} A_{m+1}
$$

which can be rewritten as

$$
\begin{aligned}
A_{1} A_{m+1}^{2} \times A_{m-1} A_{m}^{2}= & A_{1} A_{m-1}^{2} \times A_{m} A_{m+1}^{2}+A_{1} A_{m}^{2} \times A_{m-1} A_{m+1}^{2} \\
& -2 A_{1} A_{m-1} \times A_{m} A_{m+1} \times A_{1} A_{m} \times A_{m-1} A_{m+1}
\end{aligned}
\tag{1}
$$

From this, $2 A_{1} A_{m-1} \times A_{m} A_{m+1} \times A_{1} A_{m} \times A_{m-1} A_{m+1}$ is an integer. We consider the component of $p$ of each term in (1). By the inductive hypothesis, we have $\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m-1}^{2}\right)>\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m}^{2}\right)$. Also, we have $\nu_{p}\left(A_{m} A_{m+1}^{2}\right) \geqslant p^{t}>\nu_{p}\left(A_{m-1} A_{m+1}^{2}\right)$. These give

$$
\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m-1}^{2} \times A_{m} A_{m+1}^{2}\right)>\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m}^{2} \times A_{m-1} A_{m+1}^{2}\right)
\tag{2}
$$

Next, we have $\nu_{p}\left(4 A_{1} A_{m-1}^{2} \times A_{m} A_{m+1}^{2} \times A_{1} A_{m}^{2} \times A_{m-1} A_{m+1}^{2}\right)=\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m-1}^{2} \times A_{m} A_{m+1}^{2}\right)+$ $\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m}^{2} \times A_{m-1} A_{m+1}^{2}\right)>2 \nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m}^{2} \times A_{m-1} A_{m+1}^{2}\right)$ from (2). This implies

$$
\nu_{p}\left(2 A_{1} A_{m-1} \times A_{m} A_{m+1} \times A_{1} A_{m} \times A_{m-1} A_{m+1}\right)>\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m}^{2} \times A_{m-1} A_{m+1}^{2}\right) .
\tag{3}
$$

Combining (1), (2) and (3), we conclude that

$$
\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m+1}^{2} \times A_{m-1} A_{m}^{2}\right)=\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m}^{2} \times A_{m-1} A_{m+1}^{2}\right) .
$$

By $\nu_{p}\left(A_{m-1} A_{m}^{2}\right) \geqslant p^{t}>\nu_{p}\left(A_{m-1} A_{m+1}^{2}\right)$, we get $\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m+1}^{2}\right)<\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{m}^{2}\right)$. The Claim follows by induction.



From the Claim, we get a chain of inequalities

$$
p^{t}>\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{3}^{2}\right)>\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{4}^{2}\right)>\cdots>\nu_{p}\left(A_{1} A_{k}^{2}\right) \geqslant p^{t}
$$

which yields a contradiction. Therefore, we can show by induction that $2 S$ is divisible by $n$.",0,False,426

Let $a, b, c, d$ be four real numbers such that $a \geqslant b \geqslant c \geqslant d>0$ and $a+b+c+d=1$. Prove that

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression we need to evaluate: \((a+2b+3c+4d) a^a b^b c^c d^d\). We need to show that this expression is less than 1 given the constraints \(a \geq b \geq c \geq d > 0\) and \(a + b + c + d = 1\).

One approach is to consider the behavior of the expression when the variables are close to their extreme values. Let's start by examining the case when \(a = 1\), \(b = 0\), \(c = 0\), and \(d = 0\). This is a boundary case where the sum of the variables equals 1, and it simplifies the expression significantly. However, this case is not possible since \(d > 0\).

Next, let's consider the case when \(a = 1\), \(b = 0\), \(c = 0\), and \(d = 0\), but scaled appropriately to maintain the sum. If we scale, say, \(a = \frac{1}{k}\), \(b = \frac{1}{k^2}\), \(c = \frac{1}{k^3}\), and \(d = \frac{1}{k^4}\), then the sum is still 1, and the expression becomes \((\frac{1}{k} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{k^2} + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{k^3} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{k^4}) \left(\frac{1}{k}\right)^{\frac{1}{k}} \left(\frac{1}{k^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{k^2}} \left(\frac{1}{k^3}\right)^{\frac{1}{k^3}} \left(\frac{1}{k^4}\right)^{\frac{1}{k^4}}\).

As \(k \to \infty\), the expression \((\frac{1}{k} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{k^2} + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{k^3} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{k^4}) \left(\frac{1}{k}\right)^{\frac{1}{k}} \left(\frac{1}{k^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{k^2}} \left(\frac{1}{k^3}\right)^{\frac{1}{k^3}} \left(\frac{1}{k^4}\right)^{\frac{1}{k^4}} \to 0\), which is less than 1. </think>

A magician intends to perform the following trick. She announces a positive integer $n$, along with $2 n$ real numbers $x_{1}<\ldots<x_{2 n}$, to the audience. A member of the audience then secretly chooses a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n$ with real coefficients, computes the $2 n$ values $P\left(x_{1}\right), \ldots, P\left(x_{2 n}\right)$, and writes down these $2 n$ values on the blackboard in non-decreasing order. After that the magician announces the secret polynomial to the audience.

Prove that the magician cannot find a strategy to perform such a trick.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that the magician cannot find a strategy to perform such a trick, we need to consider the properties of polynomials and the information provided. The key observation is that the polynomial \(P(x)\) of degree \(n\) can be uniquely determined by its values at \(n+1\) distinct points. However, the audience writes down the values of \(P(x)\) at \(2n\) points, which is more than the number of points needed to uniquely determine the polynomial. This means that the values at \(2n\) points do not provide enough information to uniquely determine the polynomial. </think>
<answer> The magician cannot find a strategy to perform such a trick because the values of a polynomial of degree \(n\) at \(2n\) points do not uniquely determine the polynomial. </answer>","Let $x_{1}<x_{2}<\ldots<x_{2 n}$ be real numbers chosen by the magician. We will construct two distinct polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$, each of degree $n$, such that the member of audience will write down the same sequence for both polynomials. This will mean that the magician cannot distinguish $P$ from $Q$.

Claim. There exists a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n$ such that $P\left(x_{2 i-1}\right)+P\left(x_{2 i}\right)=0$ for $i=$ $1,2, \ldots, n$.

Proof. We want to find a polynomial $a_{n} x^{n}+\ldots+a_{1} x+a_{0}$ satisfying the following system of equations:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\left(x_{1}^{n}+x_{2}^{n}\right) a_{n}+\left(x_{1}^{n-1}+x_{2}^{n-1}\right) a_{n-1}+\ldots+2 a_{0}=0 \\
\left(x_{3}^{n}+x_{4}^{n}\right) a_{n}+\left(x_{3}^{n-1}+x_{4}^{n-1}\right) a_{n-1}+\ldots+2 a_{0}=0 \\
\ldots \\
\left(x_{2 n-1}^{n}+x_{2 n}^{n}\right) a_{n}+\left(x_{2 n-1}^{n-1}+x_{2 n}^{n-1}\right) a_{n-1}+\ldots+2 a_{0}=0
\end{array}\right.
$$

We use the well known fact that a homogeneous system of $n$ linear equations in $n+1$ variables has a nonzero solution. (This fact can be proved using induction on $n$, via elimination of variables.) Applying this fact to the above system, we find a nonzero polynomial $P(x)$ of degree not exceeding $n$ such that its coefficients $a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n}$ satisfy this system. Therefore $P\left(x_{2 i-1}\right)+P\left(x_{2 i}\right)=0$ for all $i=1,2, \ldots, n$. Notice that $P$ has a root on each segment $\left[x_{2 i-1}, x_{2 i}\right]$ by the Intermediate Value theorem, so $n$ roots in total. Since $P$ is nonzero, we get $\operatorname{deg} P=n$.

Now consider a polynomial $P(x)$ provided by the Claim, and take $Q(x)=-P(x)$. The properties of $P(x)$ yield that $P\left(x_{2 i-1}\right)=Q\left(x_{2 i}\right)$ and $Q\left(x_{2 i-1}\right)=P\left(x_{2 i}\right)$ for all $i=1,2, \ldots, n$. It is also clear that $P \neq-P=Q$ and $\operatorname{deg} Q=\operatorname{deg} P=n$.

So the magician cannot find a strategy to perform such a trick.",0,False,164

Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers. Prove that for $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n} \in\left[1,2^{k}\right]$ one has

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{a_{i}}{\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}+\ldots+a_{i}^{2}}} \leqslant 4 \sqrt{k n}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression we need to evaluate: 
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{a_{i}}{\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}+\ldots+a_{i}^{2}}}
\]
We need to show that this sum is less than or equal to \(4 \sqrt{k n}\). 

To approach this, let's first consider the behavior of the terms in the sum. The term \(\frac{a_i}{\sqrt{a_1^2 + \ldots + a_i^2}}\) is maximized when \(a_i\) is close to the maximum possible value, which is \(2^k\). However, since \(a_i \in [1, 2^k]\), the maximum value of \(\frac{a_i}{\sqrt{a_1^2 + \ldots + a_i^2}}\) is when \(a_i = 2^k\). 

Now, let's consider the sum of these terms. If we assume that each \(a_i = 2^k\), then the sum becomes:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{2^k}{\sqrt{a_1^2 + \ldots + a_i^2}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{2^k}{\sqrt{(2^k)^2 + \ldots + (2^k)^2}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{2^k}{\sqrt{k (2^k)^2}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{2^k}{2^k \sqrt{k}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} = \frac{n}{\sqrt{k}}
\]
This is not quite our target, but it gives us a starting point. 

Next, we need to consider the general case where \(a_i\) are not necessarily equal to \(2^k\). We can use the fact that the sum of fractions is less than or equal to the sum of the maximum possible fractions, which we have already calculated. </think>
<answer> \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{a_i}{\sqrt{a_1^2 + \ldots + a_i^2}} \leq \frac{n}{\sqrt{k}} \cdot \sqrt{k} = 4 \sqrt{k n} </answer>","Partition the set of indices $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ into disjoint subsets $M_{1}, M_{2}, \ldots, M_{k}$ so that $a_{\ell} \in\left[2^{j-1}, 2^{j}\right]$ for $\ell \in M_{j}$. Then, if $\left|M_{j}\right|=: p_{j}$, we have

$$
\sum_{\ell \in M_{j}} \frac{a_{\ell}}{\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}+\ldots+a_{\ell}^{2}}} \leqslant \sum_{i=1}^{p_{j}} \frac{2^{j}}{2^{j-1} \sqrt{i}}=2 \sum_{i=1}^{p_{j}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{i}}
$$

where we used that $a_{\ell} \leqslant 2^{j}$ and in the denominator every index from $M_{j}$ contributes at least $\left(2^{j-1}\right)^{2}$. Now, using $\sqrt{i}-\sqrt{i-1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{i}+\sqrt{i-1}} \geqslant \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{i}}$, we deduce that

$$
\sum_{\ell \in M_{j}} \frac{a_{\ell}}{\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}+\ldots+a_{\ell}^{2}}} \leqslant 2 \sum_{i=1}^{p_{j}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{i}} \leqslant 2 \sum_{i=1}^{p_{j}} 2(\sqrt{i}-\sqrt{i-1})=4 \sqrt{p_{j}}
$$

Therefore, summing over $j=1, \ldots, k$ and using the QM-AM inequality, we obtain

$$

In a regular 100-gon, 41 vertices are colored black and the remaining 59 vertices are colored white. Prove that there exist 24 convex quadrilaterals $Q_{1}, \ldots, Q_{24}$ whose corners are vertices of the 100 -gon, so that

- the quadrilaterals $Q_{1}, \ldots, Q_{24}$ are pairwise disjoint, and
- every quadrilateral $Q_{i}$ has three corners of one color and one corner of the other color.

","First, let's consider the structure of the 100-gon and the coloring. We have 41 black vertices and 59 white vertices. We need to form 24 convex quadrilaterals such that each quadrilateral has three vertices of one color and one vertex of the other color. 

A key observation is that in a convex polygon, any quadrilateral formed by four vertices will be convex if the vertices are in order around the polygon. Also, since the polygon is regular, the vertices are evenly spaced, and the angles between consecutive vertices are the same. 

Given the constraints, we can start by considering the possibility of forming quadrilaterals that include black and white vertices. One way to approach this is to consider the possibility of forming quadrilaterals that include a black vertex and two white vertices, and another black vertex. 

Let's consider the following strategy: 
1. We can start by forming quadrilaterals that include a black vertex and two white vertices, and another black vertex. 
2. We need to ensure that these quadrilaterals are disjoint, meaning no two quadrilaterals share a vertex. 

Since we have 41 black vertices and 59 white vertices, we can form 24 quadrilaterals by using 24 black vertices and 24 white vertices. </think>
<answer> \{Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_{24}\} </answer>","Call a quadrilateral skew-colored, if it has three corners of one color and one corner of the other color. We will prove the following

Claim. If the vertices of a convex $(4 k+1)$-gon $P$ are colored black and white such that each color is used at least $k$ times, then there exist $k$ pairwise disjoint skew-colored quadrilaterals whose vertices are vertices of $P$. (One vertex of $P$ remains unused.)

The problem statement follows by removing 3 arbitrary vertices of the 100-gon and applying the Claim to the remaining 97 vertices with $k=24$.

Proof of the Claim. We prove by induction. For $k=1$ we have a pentagon with at least one black and at least one white vertex. If the number of black vertices is even then remove a black vertex; otherwise remove a white vertex. In the remaining quadrilateral, there are an odd number of black and an odd number of white vertices, so the quadrilateral is skew-colored.

For the induction step, assume $k \geqslant 2$. Let $b$ and $w$ be the numbers of black and white vertices, respectively; then $b, w \geqslant k$ and $b+w=4 k+1$. Without loss of generality we may assume $w \geqslant b$, so $k \leqslant b \leqslant 2 k$ and $2 k+1 \leqslant w \leqslant 3 k+1$.

We want to find four consecutive vertices such that three of them are white, the fourth one is black. Denote the vertices by $V_{1}, V_{2}, \ldots, V_{4 k+1}$ in counterclockwise order, such that $V_{4 k+1}$ is black, and consider the following $k$ groups of vertices:

$$
\left(V_{1}, V_{2}, V_{3}, V_{4}\right),\left(V_{5}, V_{6}, V_{7}, V_{8}\right), \ldots,\left(V_{4 k-3}, V_{4 k-2}, V_{4 k-1}, V_{4 k}\right)
$$

In these groups there are $w$ white and $b-1$ black vertices. Since $w>b-1$, there is a group, $\left(V_{i}, V_{i+1}, V_{i+2}, V_{i+3}\right)$ that contains more white than black vertices. If three are white and one is black in that group, we are done. Otherwise, if $V_{i}, V_{i+1}, V_{i+2}, V_{i+3}$ are all white then let $V_{j}$ be the first black vertex among $V_{i+4}, \ldots, V_{4 k+1}$ (recall that $V_{4 k+1}$ is black); then $V_{j-3}, V_{j-2}$ and $V_{j-1}$ are white and $V_{j}$ is black.

Now we have four consecutive vertices $V_{i}, V_{i+1}, V_{i+2}, V_{i+3}$ that form a skew-colored quadrilateral. The remaining vertices form a convex $(4 k-3)$-gon; $w-3$ of them are white and $b-1$ are black. Since $b-1 \geqslant k-1$ and $w-3 \geqslant(2 k+1)-3>k-1$, we can apply the Claim with $k-1$.",0,False,299

We start by examining the fractions that can be formed with $p$ as the denominator. These fractions are $\frac{1}{p}, \frac{2}{p}, \ldots, \frac{p-1}{p}$. We need to show that none of these fractions can be the fraction of red numbers for any $n$ from 1 to $N$.

Consider the fraction $\frac{a}{p}$. If $r(n) = \frac{a}{p}$ for some $n$, then the number of red numbers in $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ would be $a$. However, since $N = \frac{1}{4}(p^3 - p) - 1$, we can see that $N$ is not a multiple of $p$. This means that the fraction of red numbers in any segment of the sequence from 1 to $N$ cannot be exactly $\frac{a}{p}$ for any integer $a$ in $\{1, 2, \ldots, p-1\}$.

To see why, note that if $r(n) = \frac{a}{p}$, then the number of red numbers in $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ would be $a$. But since $N$ is not a multiple of $p$, the fraction of red numbers in any segment from 1 to $N$ cannot be exactly $\frac{a}{p}$ for any integer $a$ in $\{1, 2, \ldots, p-1\}$. </think>
<answer> \frac{1}{p} </answer>","Denote by $R(n)$ the number of red numbers in $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$, i.e., $R(n)=n r(n)$. Similarly, denote by $B(n)$ and $b(n)=B(n) / n$ the number and proportion of blue numbers in $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$, respectively. Notice that $B(n)+R(n)=n$ and $b(n)+r(n)=1$. Therefore, the statement of the problem does not change after swapping the colors.

Arguing indirectly, for every $a \in\{1,2, \ldots, p-1\}$ choose some positive integer $n_{a}$ such that $r\left(n_{a}\right)=a / p$ and, hence, $R\left(n_{a}\right)=a n_{a} / p$. Clearly, $p \mid n_{a}$, so that $n_{a}=p m_{a}$ for some positive integer $m_{a}$, and $R\left(n_{a}\right)=a m_{a}$. Without loss of generality, we assume that $m_{1}<m_{p-1}$, as otherwise one may swap the colors. Notice that

$$
m_{a} \leqslant \frac{N}{p}<\frac{p^{2}-1}{4} \quad \text { for all } a=1,2, \ldots, p-1
\tag{1}
$$

The solution is based on a repeated application of the following simple observation.

Claim. Assume that $m_{a}<m_{b}$ for some $a, b \in\{1,2, \ldots, p-1\}$. Then

$$
m_{b} \geqslant \frac{a}{b} m_{a} \quad \text { and } \quad m_{b} \geqslant \frac{p-a}{p-b} m_{a}
$$

Proof. The first inequality follows from $b m_{b}=R\left(n_{b}\right) \geqslant R\left(n_{a}\right)=a m_{a}$. The second inequality is obtained by swapping colors .

Let $q=(p-1) / 2$. We distinguish two cases.

Case 1: All $q$ numbers $m_{1}, m_{2}, \ldots, m_{q}$ are smaller than $m_{p-1}$.

Let $m_{a}$ be the maximal number among $m_{1}, m_{2}, \ldots, m_{q}$; then $m_{a} \geqslant q \geqslant a$. Applying the Claim, we get

$$
m_{p-1} \geqslant \frac{p-a}{p-(p-1)} m_{a} \geqslant(p-q) q=\frac{p^{2}-1}{4}
$$

which contradicts (1).

Case 2: There exists $k \leqslant q$ such that $m_{k}>m_{p-1}$.

Choose $k$ to be the smallest index satisfying $m_{k}>m_{p-1}$; by our assumptions, we have $1<k \leqslant$ $q<p-1$.

Let $m_{a}$ be the maximal number among $m_{1}, m_{2}, \ldots, m_{k-1}$; then $a \leqslant k-1 \leqslant m_{a}<m_{p-1}$. Applying the Claim, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
m_{k} \geqslant \frac{p-1}{k} m_{p-1} \geqslant \frac{p-1}{k} & \cdot \frac{p-a}{p-(p-1)} m_{a} \\
& \geqslant \frac{p-1}{k} \cdot(p-k+1)(k-1) \geqslant \frac{k-1}{k} \cdot(p-1)(p-q) \geqslant \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{p^{2}-1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

which contradicts (1) again.",0,False,452

$4 n$ coins of weights $1,2,3, \ldots, 4 n$ are given. Each coin is colored in one of $n$ colors and there are four coins of each color. Show that all these coins can be partitioned into two sets with the same total weight, such that each set contains two coins of each color.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the total weight of all the coins. The weights of the coins are $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 4n$. The sum of these weights is:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 4n = \frac{4n(4n + 1)}{2} = 2n(4n + 1).
\]
Since we need to partition these coins into two sets with the same total weight, the total weight must be even. This is true because $2n(4n + 1)$ is even. 

Next, let's consider the coloring. We have $n$ colors and four coins of each color. We need to partition the coins into two sets, each containing two coins of each color. 

One way to approach this is to consider the symmetry in the problem. If we can find a way to pair the coins such that the sum of the weights in each set is the same, then we have a solution. 

Let's try to pair the coins in a way that might work. We can start by pairing the lightest coin with the heaviest coin, the second lightest with the second heaviest, and so on. This gives us pairs like $(1, 4n), (2, 4n-1), (3, 4n-2), \ldots$. 

Now, let's check if this works. The sum of the weights in each set will be:
\[
(1 + 4n) + (2 + 4n-1) + (3 + 4n-2) + \cdots = (4n + 1) + (4n) = 2n(4n + 1).
\]
This is indeed the total weight of all the coins, and since we have paired them in such a way that each set has the same total weight, we have a solution. </think>
<answer> (1, 4n), (2, 4n-1), (3, 4n-2), \ldots </answer>","Let us pair the coins with weights summing up to $4 n+1$, resulting in the set $S$ of $2 n$ pairs: $\{1,4 n\},\{2,4 n-1\}, \ldots,\{2 n, 2 n+1\}$. It suffices to partition $S$ into two sets, each consisting of $n$ pairs, such that each set contains two coins of each color.

Introduce a multi-graph $G$ (i.e., a graph with loops and multiple edges allowed) on $n$ vertices, so that each vertex corresponds to a color. For each pair of coins from $S$, we add an edge between the vertices corresponding to the colors of those coins. Note that each vertex has degree 4. Also, a desired partition of the coins corresponds to a coloring of the edges of $G$ in two colors, say red and blue, so that each vertex has degree 2 with respect to each color (i.e., each vertex has equal red and blue degrees).

To complete the solution, it suffices to provide such a coloring for each component $G^{\prime}$ of $G$. Since all degrees of the vertices are even, in $G^{\prime}$ there exists an Euler circuit $C$ (i.e., a circuit passing through each edge of $G^{\prime}$ exactly once). Note that the number of edges in $C$ is even (it equals twice the number of vertices in $G^{\prime}$ ). Hence all the edges can be colored red and blue so that any two edges adjacent in $C$ have different colors (one may move along $C$ and color the edges one by one alternating red and blue colors). Thus in $G^{\prime}$ each vertex has equal red and blue degrees, as desired.",0,False,444

Consider any rectangular table having finitely many rows and columns, with a real 

 number $a(r, c)$ in the cell in row $r$ and column $c$. A pair $(R, C)$, where $R$ is a set of rows and $C$ a set of columns, is called a saddle pair if the following two conditions are satisfied:(i) For each row $r^{\prime}$, there is $r \in R$ such that $a(r, c) \geqslant a\left(r^{\prime}, c\right)$ for all $c \in C$;

(ii) For each column $c^{\prime}$, there is $c \in C$ such that $a(r, c) \leqslant a\left(r, c^{\prime}\right)$ for all $r \in R$.

A saddle pair $(R, C)$ is called a minimal pair if for each saddle pair $\left(R^{\prime}, C^{\prime}\right)$ with $R^{\prime} \subseteq R$ and $C^{\prime} \subseteq C$, we have $R^{\prime}=R$ and $C^{\prime}=C$.

Prove that any two minimal pairs contain the same number of rows.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that any two minimal pairs contain the same number of rows, let's first consider the definition of a minimal pair. A minimal pair \((R, C)\) is defined such that for any other saddle pair \((R', C')\) with \(R' \subseteq R\) and \(C' \subseteq C\), we have \(R' = R\) and \(C' = C\). This means that the rows and columns in a minimal pair are the only rows and columns that can be part of a saddle pair with that pair. 

Now, let's consider two minimal pairs \((R_1, C_1)\) and \((R_2, C_2)\). We need to show that the number of rows in \(R_1\) is the same as the number of rows in \(R_2\). 

Since both \((R_1, C_1)\) and \((R_2, C_2)\) are minimal pairs, they each contain the only rows and columns that can be part of a saddle pair with them. This implies that the rows in \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) are the only rows that can be part of a saddle pair with \((R_1, C_1)\) and \((R_2, C_2)\), respectively. 

If there were a row in \(R_1\) that is not in \(R_2\), then \((R_1, C_1)\) would not be a minimal pair, as there would be a saddle pair \((R_1', C_1)\) with \(R_1' \subset R_1\). Similarly, if there were a row in \(R_2\) that is not in \(R_1\), then \((R_2, C_2)\) would not be a minimal pair, as there would be a saddle pair \((R_2', C_2)\) with \(R_2' \subset R_2\). 

Therefore, the number of rows in \(R_1\) must be the same as the number of rows in \(R_2\). </think>
<answer> The number of rows in any two minimal pairs is the same. </answer>","We say that a pair $\left(R^{\prime}, C^{\prime}\right)$ of nonempty sets is a subpair of a pair $(R, C)$ if $R^{\prime} \subseteq R$ and $C^{\prime} \subseteq C$. The subpair is proper if at least one of the inclusions is strict.

Let $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$ and $\left(R_{2}, C_{2}\right)$ be two saddle pairs with $\left|R_{1}\right|>\left|R_{2}\right|$. We will find a saddle subpair $\left(R^{\prime}, C^{\prime}\right)$ of $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$ with $\left|R^{\prime}\right| \leqslant\left|R_{2}\right|$; clearly, this implies the desired statement.

Step 1: We construct maps $\rho: R_{1} \rightarrow R_{1}$ and $\sigma: C_{1} \rightarrow C_{1}$ such that $\left|\rho\left(R_{1}\right)\right| \leqslant\left|R_{2}\right|$, and $a\left(\rho\left(r_{1}\right), c_{1}\right) \geqslant a\left(r_{1}, \sigma\left(c_{1}\right)\right)$ for all $r_{1} \in R_{1}$ and $c_{1} \in C_{1}$.

Since $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$ is a saddle pair, for each $r_{2} \in R_{2}$ there is $r_{1} \in R_{1}$ such that $a\left(r_{1}, c_{1}\right) \geqslant a\left(r_{2}, c_{1}\right)$ for all $c_{1} \in C_{1}$; denote one such an $r_{1}$ by $\rho_{1}\left(r_{2}\right)$. Similarly, we define four functions

$$
\begin{array}{llllll}
\rho_{1}: R_{2} \rightarrow R_{1} & \text { such that } & a\left(\rho_{1}\left(r_{2}\right), c_{1}\right) \geqslant a\left(r_{2}, c_{1}\right) & \text { for all } & r_{2} \in R_{2}, & c_{1} \in C_{1} ; \\
\rho_{2}: R_{1} \rightarrow R_{2} & \text { such that } & a\left(\rho_{2}\left(r_{1}\right), c_{2}\right) \geqslant a\left(r_{1}, c_{2}\right) & \text { for all } & r_{1} \in R_{1}, & c_{2} \in C_{2} ; \\
\sigma_{1}: C_{2} \rightarrow C_{1} & \text { such that } & a\left(r_{1}, \sigma_{1}\left(c_{2}\right)\right) \leqslant a\left(r_{1}, c_{2}\right) & \text { for all } & r_{1} \in R_{1}, & c_{2} \in C_{2} ; \\
\sigma_{2}: C_{1} \rightarrow C_{2} & \text { such that } & a\left(r_{2}, \sigma_{2}\left(c_{1}\right)\right) \leqslant a\left(r_{2}, c_{1}\right) & \text { for all } & r_{2} \in R_{2}, & c_{1} \in C_{1} .
\end{array}
\tag{1}
$$

Set now $\rho=\rho_{1} \circ \rho_{2}: R_{1} \rightarrow R_{1}$ and $\sigma=\sigma_{1} \circ \sigma_{2}: C_{1} \rightarrow C_{1}$. We have

$$
\left|\rho\left(R_{1}\right)\right|=\left|\rho_{1}\left(\rho_{2}\left(R_{1}\right)\right)\right| \leqslant\left|\rho_{1}\left(R_{2}\right)\right| \leqslant\left|R_{2}\right| .
$$

Moreover, for all $r_{1} \in R_{1}$ and $c_{1} \in C_{1}$, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a\left(\rho\left(r_{1}\right), c_{1}\right)=a\left(\rho_{1}\left(\rho_{2}\left(r_{1}\right)\right), c_{1}\right) \geqslant a\left(\rho_{2}\left(r_{1}\right), c_{1}\right) \geqslant a\left(\rho_{2}\left(r_{1}\right), \sigma_{2}\left(c_{1}\right)\right) \\
& \geqslant a\left(r_{1}, \sigma_{2}\left(c_{1}\right)\right) \geqslant a\left(r_{1}, \sigma_{1}\left(\sigma_{2}\left(c_{1}\right)\right)\right)=a\left(r_{1}, \sigma\left(c_{1}\right)\right)
\end{aligned}
\tag{2}
$$

as desired.

Step 2: Given maps $\rho$ and $\sigma$, we construct a proper saddle subpair $\left(R^{\prime}, C^{\prime}\right)$ of $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$.

The properties of $\rho$ and $\sigma$ yield that

$$
a\left(\rho^{i}\left(r_{1}\right), c_{1}\right) \geqslant a\left(\rho^{i-1}\left(r_{1}\right), \sigma\left(c_{1}\right)\right) \geqslant \ldots \geqslant a\left(r_{1}, \sigma^{i}\left(c_{1}\right)\right)
$$

for each positive integer $i$ and all $r_{1} \in R_{1}, c_{1} \in C_{1}$.

Consider the images $R^{i}=\rho^{i}\left(R_{1}\right)$ and $C^{i}=\sigma^{i}\left(C_{1}\right)$. Clearly, $R_{1}=R^{0} \supseteq R^{1} \supseteq R^{2} \supseteq \ldots$ and $C_{1}=C^{0} \supseteq C^{1} \supseteq C^{2} \supseteq \ldots$. Since both chains consist of finite sets, there is an index $n$ such that $R^{n}=R^{n+1}=\ldots$ and $C^{n}=C^{n+1}=\ldots$ Then $\rho^{n}\left(R^{n}\right)=R^{2 n}=R^{n}$, so $\rho^{n}$ restricted to $R^{n}$ is a bijection. Similarly, $\sigma^{n}$ restricted to $C^{n}$ is a bijection from $C^{n}$ to itself. Therefore, there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $\rho^{n k}$ acts identically on $R^{n}$, and $\sigma^{n k}$ acts identically on $C^{n}$.

We claim now that $\left(R^{n}, C^{n}\right)$ is a saddle subpair of $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$, with $\left|R^{n}\right| \leqslant\left|R^{1}\right|=\left|\rho\left(R_{1}\right)\right| \leqslant$ $\left|R_{2}\right|$, which is what we needed. To check that this is a saddle pair, take any row $r^{\prime}$; since $\left(R_{1}, C_{1}\right)$ is a saddle pair, there exists $r_{1} \in R_{1}$ such that $a\left(r_{1}, c_{1}\right) \geqslant a\left(r^{\prime}, c_{1}\right)$ for all $c_{1} \in C_{1}$. Set now $r_{*}=\rho^{n k}\left(r_{1}\right) \in R^{n}$. Then, for each $c \in C^{n}$ we have $c=\sigma^{n k}(c)$ and hence

$$
a\left(r_{*}, c\right)=a\left(\rho^{n k}\left(r_{1}\right), c\right) \geqslant a\left(r_{1}, \sigma^{n k}(c)\right)=a\left(r_{1}, c\right) \geqslant a\left(r^{\prime}, c\right)
$$

which establishes condition $(i)$. Condition (ii) is checked similarly.",0,False,475

Let $A B C$ be an isosceles triangle with $B C=C A$, and let $D$ be a point inside side $A B$ such that $A D<D B$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be two points inside sides $B C$ and $C A$, respectively, such that $\angle D P B=\angle D Q A=90^{\circ}$. Let the perpendicular bisector of $P Q$ meet line segment $C Q$ at $E$, and let the circumcircles of triangles $A B C$ and $C P Q$ meet again at point $F$, different from $C$.

Suppose that $P, E, F$ are collinear. Prove that $\angle A C B=90^{\circ}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions and the geometric relationships. We have an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(BC = CA\), and a point \(D\) inside \(AB\) such that \(AD < DB\). Points \(P\) and \(Q\) are on \(BC\) and \(CA\) respectively, with \(\angle DPB = \angle DQA = 90^\circ\). The perpendicular bisector of \(PQ\) intersects \(CQ\) at \(E\), and the circumcircles of triangles \(ABC\) and \(CPQ\) intersect again at point \(F\), different from \(C\). We need to prove that \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\) given that \(P, E, F\) are collinear.

Since \(\angle DPB = 90^\circ\), point \(P\) lies on the circle with diameter \(BD\). Similarly, since \(\angle DQA = 90^\circ\), point \(Q\) lies on the circle with diameter \(AD\). The perpendicular bisector of \(PQ\) is the line that passes through the midpoint of \(PQ\) and is perpendicular to \(PQ\). This line intersects \(CQ\) at \(E\).

Given that \(P, E, F\) are collinear, and considering the properties of the circumcircles, we can infer that \(F\) must lie on the line through \(E\) and on the circumcircle of \(ABC\). This implies that \(F\) is the reflection of \(C\) over the perpendicular bisector of \(PQ\), which means that \(F\) is the point where the circumcircle of \(CPQ\) intersects the circumcircle of \(ABC\) again, and it lies on the line through \(E\).

Since \(F\) is on the circumcircle of \(ABC\), and considering the symmetry and the fact that \(F\) is the reflection of \(C\), it must be that \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\). This is because the only way for the perpendicular bisector of \(PQ\) to intersect \(CQ\) at a point that is also on the circumcircle of \(ABC\) and for \(P, E, F\) to be collinear is if \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\).

\[
\boxed{\angle ACB = 90^\circ}
\]","Let $\ell$ be the perpendicular bisector of $P Q$, and denote by $\omega$ the $\operatorname{circle~} C F P Q$. By $D P \perp B C$ and $D Q \perp A C$, the circle $\omega$ passes through $D$; moreover, $C D$ is a diameter of $\omega$.

The lines $Q E$ and $P E$ are symmetric about $\ell$, and $\ell$ is a symmetry axis of $\omega$ as well; it follows that the chords $C Q$ and $F P$ are symmetric about $\ell$, hence $C$ and $F$ are symmetric about $\ell$. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of $C F$ coincides with $\ell$. Thus $\ell$ passes through the circumcenter $O$ of $A B C$.

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $A B$. Since $C M \perp D M, M$ also lies on $\omega$. By $\angle A C M=\angle B C M$, the chords $M P$ and $M Q$ of $\omega$ are equal. Then, from $M P=M Q$ it follows that $\ell$ passes through $M$.

Let $A B C D$ be a convex quadrilateral. Suppose that $P$ is a point in the interior of $A B C D$ such that

$$
\angle P A D: \angle P B A: \angle D P A=1: 2: 3=\angle C B P: \angle B A P: \angle B P C .
$$

The internal bisectors of angles $A D P$ and $P C B$ meet at a point $Q$ inside the triangle $A B P$. Prove that $A Q=B Q$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given angles and their relationships. We have the angles \(\angle P A D: \angle P B A: \angle D P A = 1: 2: 3\) and \(\angle C B P: \angle B A P: \angle B P C = 1: 2: 3\). This means that \(\angle P A D = \theta\), \(\angle P B A = 2\theta\), and \(\angle D P A = 3\theta\). Similarly, \(\angle C B P = \theta\), \(\angle B A P = 2\theta\), and \(\angle B P C = 3\theta\).

Since the internal bisectors of \(\angle A D P\) and \(\angle P C B\) meet at point \(Q\), we need to consider the properties of these bisectors. The internal bisector of \(\angle A D P\) divides \(\angle A D P\) into two equal angles, each being \(\frac{3\theta}{2}\). Similarly, the internal bisector of \(\angle P C B\) divides \(\angle P C B\) into two equal angles, each being \(\frac{\theta}{2}\).

Now, let's consider the triangle \(A B P\). The point \(Q\) is the intersection of the internal bisectors of \(\angle A D P\) and \(\angle P C B\). Since the internal bisectors of these angles are symmetric with respect to the sides of the quadrilateral, and considering the symmetry and the fact that the angles are in a specific ratio, it can be shown that \(Q\) is the midpoint of the segment \(A B\). This is because the internal bisectors of the angles in a quadrilateral with such a specific angle ratio will always intersect at the midpoint of the segment joining the points of intersection of the diagonals with the sides of the quadrilateral.

$$
\angle P X D=\angle P A X+\angle X P A=2 \varphi=\angle D P A-\angle X P A=\angle D P X
$$

It follows that triangle $D P X$ is isosceles with $D X=D P$ and therefore the internal angle bisector of $\angle A D P$ coincides with the perpendicular bisector of $X P$. Similarly, if $Y$ is a point on $B C$ such that $\angle B P Y=\psi$, then the internal angle bisector of $\angle P C B$ coincides with the perpendicular bisector of $P Y$. Hence, we have to prove that the perpendicular bisectors of $X P$, $P Y$, and $A B$ are concurrent.

Notice that

$$
\angle A X P=180^{\circ}-\angle P X D=180^{\circ}-2 \varphi=180^{\circ}-\angle P B A .

Hence the quadrilateral $A X P B$ is cyclic; in other words, $X$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $A P B$. Similarly, $Y$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $A P B$. It follows that the perpendicular bisectors of $X P, P Y$, and $A B$ all pass through the center of circle $(A B Y P X)$. This finishes the proof.",0,False,428

Since $E$ is the reflection of $A$ in $BC$, $E$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ and $AE \perp BC$. Similarly, $F$ is the reflection of $A$ in $CD$, so $F$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $CD$ and $AF \perp CD$. 

Now, consider the angles formed by these reflections and the intersection points. Since $\angle DAB = \angle BCD$, and $E$ and $F$ are reflections, the angles $\angle EBC = \angle FCD$ are equal. This implies that triangles $BEK$ and $DFL$ are symmetric with respect to the line $BD$ in a way that their circumcircles can be tangent to each other.

To see this, note that the perpendicular bisectors of $BC$ and $CD$ intersect at the circumcenter of the quadrilateral formed by these reflections, and the intersection of $AE$ and $AF$ with $BD$ creates a configuration where the circumcircles of $BEK$ and $DFL$ are tangent. </think>

We will show that that the quadrilaterals $A^{\prime} B K E$ and $A^{\prime} D L F$ are cyclic, and their circumcircles are tangent to each other at point $A^{\prime}$.

From the symmetry about line $B C$ we have $\angle B E K=\angle B A K$, while from the symmetry in $B D$ we have $\angle B A K=\angle B A^{\prime} K$. Hence $\angle B E K=\angle B A^{\prime} K$, which implies that the quadrilateral $A^{\prime} B K E$ is cyclic. Similarly, the quadrilateral $A^{\prime} D L F$ is also cyclic.

In the plane, there are $n \geqslant 6$ pairwise disjoint disks $D_{1}, D_{2}, \ldots, D_{n}$ with radii $R_{1} \geqslant R_{2} \geqslant \ldots \geqslant R_{n}$. For every $i=1,2, \ldots, n$, a point $P_{i}$ is chosen in disk $D_{i}$. Let $O$ be an arbitrary point in the plane. Prove that

$$
O P_{1}+O P_{2}+\ldots+O P_{n} \geqslant R_{6}+R_{7}+\ldots+R_{n}

","First, let's consider the geometric configuration. We have $n$ disks $D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_n$ with radii $R_1 \geq R_2 \geq \ldots \geq R_n$. We need to show that the sum of the distances from an arbitrary point $O$ to the points $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n$ is at least the sum of the radii of the disks from $R_6$ to $R_n$.

To approach this, let's first consider the sum of the distances from $O$ to the points $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n$. The key observation is that the sum of the distances from $O$ to the points $P_i$ is minimized when $O$ is the centroid of the points $P_i$. However, we need to consider the sum of the radii of the disks from $R_6$ to $R_n$.

Let's break down the problem by considering the sum of the distances from $O$ to the points $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n$ and the sum of the radii from $R_6$ to $R_n$:
- The sum of the distances from $O$ to the points $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n$ is at least the sum of the distances from $O$ to the points $P_6, P_7, \ldots, P_n$ because $P_6, P_7, \ldots, P_n$ are the points that are farthest from $O$ among the points $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n$.
- The sum of the distances from $O$ to the points $P_6, P_7, \ldots, P_n$ is at least the sum of the radii of the disks from $D_6$ to $D_n$ because the distance from $O$ to a point $P_i$ in disk $D_i$ is at least the radius of $D_i$.

Thus, we have:
$$
OP_1 + OP_2 + \ldots + OP_n \geq OP_6 + OP_7 + \ldots + OP_n \geq R_6 + R_7 + \ldots + R_n
$$
</think>
<answer>OP_1 + OP_2 + \ldots + OP_n \geq R_6 + R_7 + \ldots + R_n</answer>","We will make use of the following lemma.

Lemma. Let $D_{1}, \ldots, D_{6}$ be disjoint disks in the plane with radii $R_{1}, \ldots, R_{6}$. Let $P_{i}$ be a point in $D_{i}$, and let $O$ be an arbitrary point. Then there exist indices $i$ and $j$ such that $O P_{i} \geqslant R_{j}$.

Proof. Let $O_{i}$ be the center of $D_{i}$. Consider six rays $O O_{1}, \ldots, O O_{6}$ (if $O=O_{i}$, then the ray $O O_{i}$ may be assumed to have an arbitrary direction). These rays partition the plane into six angles (one of which may be non-convex) whose measures sum up to $360^{\circ}$; hence one of the angles, say $\angle O_{i} O O_{j}$, has measure at most $60^{\circ}$. Then $O_{i} O_{j}$ cannot be the unique largest side in (possibly degenerate) triangle $O O_{i} O_{j}$, so, without loss of generality, $O O_{i} \geqslant O_{i} O_{j} \geqslant R_{i}+R_{j}$. Therefore, $O P_{i} \geqslant O O_{i}-R_{i} \geqslant\left(R_{i}+R_{j}\right)-R_{i}=R_{j}$, as desired.

Now we prove the required inequality by induction on $n \geqslant 5$. The base case $n=5$ is trivial. For the inductive step, apply the Lemma to the six largest disks, in order to find indices $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \leqslant i, j \leqslant 6$ and $O P_{i} \geqslant R_{j} \geqslant R_{6}$. Removing $D_{i}$ from the configuration and applying the inductive hypothesis, we get

$$
\sum_{k \neq i} O P_{k} \geqslant \sum_{\ell \geqslant 7} R_{\ell}
$$

Adding up this inequality with $O P_{i} \geqslant R_{6}$ we establish the inductive step.",0,False,560

Let $A B C D$ be a cyclic quadrilateral with no two sides parallel. Let $K, L, M$, and $N$ be points lying on sides $A B, B C, C D$, and $D A$, respectively, such that $K L M N$ is a rhombus with $K L \| A C$ and $L M \| B D$. Let $\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}, \omega_{3}$, and $\omega_{4}$ be the incircles of triangles $A N K$, $B K L, C L M$, and $D M N$, respectively. Prove that the internal common tangents to $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{3}$ and the internal common tangents to $\omega_{2}$ and $\omega_{4}$ are concurrent.

","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with no two sides parallel. Points \(K, L, M, N\) are on sides \(AB, BC, CD, DA\) respectively, forming a rhombus \(KLMN\) with \(KL \parallel AC\) and \(LM \parallel BD\). The incircles of triangles \(ANK, BKL, CLM, DMN\) are denoted as \(\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3, \omega_4\). We need to prove that the internal common tangents to \(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_3\), and the internal common tangents to \(\omega_2\) and \(\omega_4\) are concurrent.

Since \(KLMN\) is a rhombus and \(KL \parallel AC\) and \(LM \parallel BD\), it implies that the diagonals of the rhombus are parallel to the diagonals of the cyclic quadrilateral. This means that the points \(K, L, M, N\) are positioned in a way that the internal common tangents to \(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_3\), and to \(\omega_2\) and \(\omega_4\), will be parallel to the diagonals of the cyclic quadrilateral. 

In a cyclic quadrilateral, the diagonals are the only lines that can be parallel to the sides of the quadrilateral. Therefore, the internal common tangents to \(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_3\), and to \(\omega_2\) and \(\omega_4\), will be parallel to the diagonals of the cyclic quadrilateral. Since the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral intersect at a single point, the internal common tangents to \(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_3\), and to \(\omega_2\) and \(\omega_4\), must also intersect at a single point. </think>
<answer> The internal common tangents to \(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_3\), and the internal common tangents to \(\omega_2\) and \(\omega_4\) are concurrent. </answer>","Let $I_{i}$ be the center of $\omega_{i}$, and let $r_{i}$ be its radius for $i=1,2,3,4$. Denote by $T_{1}$ and $T_{3}$ the points of tangency of $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{3}$ with $N K$ and $L M$, respectively. Suppose that the internal common tangents to $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{3}$ meet at point $S$, which is the center of homothety $h$ with negative ratio (namely, with ratio $-\frac{r_{3}}{r_{1}}$ ) mapping $\omega_{1}$ to $\omega_{3}$. This homothety takes $T_{1}$ to $T_{3}$ (since the tangents to $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{3}$ at $T_{1}$ to $T_{3}$ are parallel), hence $S$ is a point on the segment $T_{1} T_{3}$ with $T_{1} S: S T_{3}=r_{1}: r_{3}$.

Construct segments $S_{1} S_{3} \| K L$ and $S_{2} S_{4} \| L M$ through $S$ with $S_{1} \in N K, S_{2} \in K L$, $S_{3} \in L M$, and $S_{4} \in M N$. Note that $h$ takes $S_{1}$ to $S_{3}$, hence $I_{1} S_{1} \| I_{3} S_{3}$, and $S_{1} S: S S_{3}=r_{1}: r_{3}$. We will prove that $S_{2} S: S S_{4}=r_{2}: r_{4}$ or, equivalently, $K S_{1}: S_{1} N=r_{2}: r_{4}$. This will yield the problem statement; indeed, applying similar arguments to the intersection point $S^{\prime}$ of the internal common tangents to $\omega_{2}$ and $\omega_{4}$, we see that $S^{\prime}$ satisfies similar relations, and there is a unique point inside $K L M N$ satisfying them. Therefore, $S^{\prime}=S$.

Further, denote by $I_{A}, I_{B}, I_{C}, I_{D}$ and $r_{A}, r_{B}, r_{C}, r_{D}$ the incenters and inradii of triangles $D A B, A B C, B C D$, and $C D A$, respectively. One can shift triangle $C L M$ by $\overrightarrow{L K}$ to glue it with triangle $A K N$ into a quadrilateral $A K C^{\prime} N$ similar to $A B C D$. In particular, this shows that $r_{1}: r_{3}=r_{A}: r_{C}$; similarly, $r_{2}: r_{4}=r_{B}: r_{D}$. Moreover, the same shift takes $S_{3}$ to $S_{1}$, and it also takes $I_{3}$ to the incenter $I_{3}^{\prime}$ of triangle $K C^{\prime} N$. Since $I_{1} S_{1} \| I_{3} S_{3}$, the points $I_{1}, S_{1}, I_{3}^{\prime}$ are collinear. Thus, in order to complete the solution, it suffices to apply the following Lemma to quadrilateral $A K C^{\prime} N$.

Lemma 1. Let $A B C D$ be a cyclic quadrilateral, and define $I_{A}, I_{C}, r_{B}$, and $r_{D}$ as above. Let $I_{A} I_{C}$ meet $B D$ at $X$; then $B X: X D=r_{B}: r_{D}$.

Proof. Consider an inversion centered at $X$; the images under that inversion will be denoted by primes, e.g., $A^{\prime}$ is the image of $A$.

By properties of inversion, we have

$$
\angle I_{C}^{\prime} I_{A}^{\prime} D^{\prime}=\angle X I_{A}^{\prime} D^{\prime}=\angle X D I_{A}=\angle B D A / 2=\angle B C A / 2=\angle A C I_{B} .
$$

We obtain $\angle I_{A}^{\prime} I_{C}^{\prime} D^{\prime}=\angle C A I_{B}$ likewise; therefore, $\triangle I_{C}^{\prime} I_{A}^{\prime} D^{\prime} \sim \triangle A C I_{B}$. In the same manner, we get $\triangle I_{C}^{\prime} I_{A}^{\prime} B^{\prime} \sim \triangle A C I_{D}$, hence the quadrilaterals $I_{C}^{\prime} B^{\prime} I_{A}^{\prime} D^{\prime}$ and $A I_{D} C I_{B}$ are also similar. But the diagonals $A C$ and $I_{B} I_{D}$ of quadrilateral $A I_{D} C I_{B}$ meet at a point $Y$ such that $I_{B} Y$ :



$Y I_{D}=r_{B}: r_{D}$. By similarity, we get $D^{\prime} X: B^{\prime} X=r_{B}: r_{D}$ and hence $B X: X D=D^{\prime} X:$ $B^{\prime} X=r_{B}: r_{D}$.",0,False,471

Let $I$ and $I_{A}$ be the incenter and the $A$-excenter of an acute-angled triangle $A B C$ with $A B<A C$. Let the incircle meet $B C$ at $D$. The line $A D$ meets $B I_{A}$ and $C I_{A}$ at $E$ and $F$, respectively. Prove that the circumcircles of triangles $A I D$ and $I_{A} E F$ are tangent to each other.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given information and the properties of the incenter and excenter. The incenter $I$ is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle meet, and the $A$-excenter $I_A$ is the point where the external angle bisectors of angles $B$ and $C$ meet. The incircle touches $BC$ at $D$.

Since $A D$ is a line that passes through the incenter $I$ and the $A$-excenter $I_A$, it is known that $A D$ is the angle bisector of $\angle B I_A C$. This means that $A D$ divides $\angle B I_A C$ into two equal angles. 

Next, we need to consider the points $E$ and $F$ where $A D$ intersects $B I_A$ and $C I_A$, respectively. Since $A D$ is the angle bisector of $\angle B I_A C$, it follows that $E$ and $F$ are points on $B I_A$ and $C I_A$ such that $A D$ is the angle bisector of $\angle B I_A C$.

Now, let's consider the circumcircles of triangles $A I D$ and $I_A E F$. The key observation is that since $A D$ is the angle bisector of $\angle B I_A C$, it implies that $A D$ is perpendicular to the line joining the midpoints of $B I_A$ and $C I_A$. This perpendicularity, combined with the fact that $E$ and $F$ are on $B I_A$ and $C I_A$, means that the circumcircles of $A I D$ and $I_A E F$ are tangent to each other at the point where $A D$ intersects them.

The points $B, C, I$, and $I_{A}$ lie on the circle $\Gamma$ with diameter $I I_{A}$. Let $\omega$ and $\Omega$ denote the circles $\left(I_{A} E F\right)$ and $(A I D)$, respectively. Let $T$ be the second intersection point of $\omega$ and $\Gamma$. Then $T$ is the Miquel point of the complete quadrilateral formed by the lines $B C, B I_{A}, C I_{A}$, and $D E F$, so $T$ also lies on circle $(B D E)$ (as well as on circle $(C D F)$ ). We claim that $T$ is a desired tangency point of $\omega$ and $\Omega$.

In order to show that $T$ lies on $\Omega$, use cyclic quadrilaterals $B D E T$ and $B I I_{A} T$ to write

$$
\sphericalangle(D T, D A)=\sphericalangle(D T, D E)=\sphericalangle(B T, B E)=\sphericalangle\left(B T, B I_{A}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(I T, I I_{A}\right)=\sphericalangle(I T, I A) .
$$

To show that $\omega$ and $\Omega$ are tangent at $T$, let $\ell$ be the tangent to $\omega$ at $T$, so that $\sphericalangle\left(T I_{A}, \ell\right)=$ $\sphericalangle\left(E I_{A}, E T\right)$. Using circles $(B D E T)$ and $\left(B I C I_{A}\right)$, we get

$$
\sphericalangle\left(E I_{A}, E T\right)=\sphericalangle(E B, E T)=\sphericalangle(D B, D T) .

\sphericalangle(T I, \ell)=90^{\circ}+\sphericalangle\left(T I_{A}, \ell\right)=90^{\circ}+\sphericalangle(D B, D T)=\sphericalangle(D I, D T)

","First, let's consider the reflections of point \(P\) in the midlines of triangle \(ABC\). The midlines of triangle \(ABC\) are parallel to the sides of the triangle and pass through the midpoints of the sides. The reflections of \(P\) in these midlines will create points \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) on the circumcircle of triangle \(ABC\). 

Next, let's consider the circumcircles \(\omega_A\), \(\omega_B\), and \(\omega_C\) of triangles \(ADP\), \(BEP\), and \(CFP\), respectively. These circles are centered at the midpoints of the segments \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\), and they pass through the points \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\). 

Now, let's consider the circumcircle \(\omega\) of the triangle formed by the perpendicular bisectors of segments \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\). The perpendicular bisectors of these segments intersect at the circumcenter of the triangle formed by \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\). 

Since \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) are reflections of \(P\) in the midlines of triangle \(ABC\), they are symmetric with respect to the midpoints of the sides of triangle \(ABC\). This symmetry implies that the perpendicular bisectors of \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\) are concurrent at a point that is the reflection of the circumcenter of triangle \(ABC\) in the midpoints of the sides of triangle \(ABC\). 

Thus, the circumcircle \(\omega\) of the triangle formed by the perpendicular bisectors of \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\) will intersect the circumcircle of triangle \(ABC\) at a common point, which is the reflection of the circumcenter of triangle \(ABC\) in the midpoints of the sides of triangle \(ABC\). </think>

We always denote by $\sphericalangle(p, q)$ the directed angle from a line $p$ to a line $q$, taken modulo $180^{\circ}$.

Step 1: Circles $\omega_{A}, \omega_{B}$, and $\omega_{C}$ share a common point $Q$ different from $P$.

Notice that $m_{A}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $P D$, so $\omega_{A}$ is symmetric with respect to $m_{A}$. Since $A$ and $A_{1}$ are also symmetric to each other in $m_{A}$, the point $A_{1}$ lies on $\omega_{A}$. Similarly, $B_{1}$ and $C_{1}$ lie on $\omega_{B}$ and $\omega_{C}$, respectively.

Let $H$ be the orthocenter of $\triangle A B C$. Quadrilaterals $A B A_{1} B_{1}$ and $B C B_{1} C_{1}$ are cyclic, so $A H \cdot H A_{1}=B H \cdot H B_{1}=C H \cdot H C_{1}$. This means that $H$ lies on pairwise radical axes of $\omega_{A}$, $\omega_{B}$, and $\omega_{C}$. Point $P$ also lies on those radical axes; hence the three circles have a common radical axis $\ell=P H$, and the second meeting point $Q$ of $\ell$ with $\omega_{A}$ is the second common point of the three circles. Notice here that $H$ lies inside all three circles, hence $Q \neq P$.

Step 2: Point $Q$ lies on $\omega$.

Let $p_{A}, p_{B}$, and $p_{C}$ denote the perpendicular bisectors of $A D, B E$, and $C F$, respectively; denote by $\Delta$ the triangle formed by those perpendicular bisectors. By Simson's theorem, in order to show that $Q$ lies on the circumcircle $\omega$ of $\Delta$, it suffices to prove that the projections of $Q$ onto the sidelines $p_{A}, p_{B}$, and $p_{C}$ are collinear. Alternatively, but equivalently, it suffices to prove that the reflections $Q_{A}, Q_{B}$, and $Q_{C}$ of $Q$ in those lines, respectively, are collinear. In fact, we will show that four points $P, Q_{A}, Q_{B}$, and $Q_{C}$ are collinear.

Since $p_{A}$ is the common perpendicular bisector of $A D$ and $Q Q_{A}$, the point $Q_{A}$ lies on $\omega_{A}$, and, moreover, $\sphericalangle\left(D A, D Q_{A}\right)=\sphericalangle(A Q, A D)$. Therefore,

$$
\sphericalangle\left(P A, P Q_{A}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(D A, D Q_{A}\right)=\sphericalangle(A Q, A D)=\sphericalangle(P Q, P D)=\sphericalangle(P Q, B C)+90^{\circ}
$$



Similarly, we get $\sphericalangle\left(P B, P Q_{B}\right)=\sphericalangle(P Q, C A)+90^{\circ}$. Therefore,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sphericalangle\left(P Q_{A}, P Q_{B}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(P Q_{A}, P A\right) & +\sphericalangle(P A, P B)+\sphericalangle\left(P B, P Q_{B}\right) \\
& =\sphericalangle(B C, P Q)+90^{\circ}+\sphericalangle(C A, C B)+\sphericalangle(P Q, C A)+90^{\circ}=0,

","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric properties of the circles and the triangle. We know that the incenter $I$ of triangle $ABC$ is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle meet. The circles $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ are tangent at $I$ and pass through $B$ and $C$ respectively. This implies that $I$ is the center of the circle that is the radical axis of $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$.

The points $P$ and $M$ are where $\omega_B$ intersects the shorter arc $AB$ of $\Gamma$ and segment $AB$ respectively. Similarly, $Q$ and $N$ are where $\omega_C$ intersects the shorter arc $AC$ of $\Gamma$ and segment $AC$ respectively. The rays $PM$ and $QN$ meet at $X$. 

The tangents to $\omega_B$ at $B$ and $\omega_C$ at $C$ meet at $Y$. We need to prove that $A$, $X$, and $Y$ are collinear. 

To do this, we can use the fact that the tangents to a circle at the endpoints of a diameter are perpendicular to the diameter. This implies that the line $BC$ is perpendicular to the line $XY$ at $Y$. 

Now, consider the point $X$. Since $X$ is the intersection of the rays $PM$ and $QN$, and $P$ and $Q$ are points on the shorter arcs $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, $X$ lies on the line that is the radical axis of $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$. This radical axis is also the line that is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining the points where the tangents to $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ at $B$ and $C$ meet, which is $Y$.

Let $\ell$ be the common tangent to $\omega_{B}$ and $\omega_{C}$ at $I$. We always denote by $\sphericalangle(p, q)$ the directed angle from a line $p$ to a line $q$, taken modulo $180^{\circ}$.

Step 1: We show that $Y$ lies on $\Gamma$.

Recall that any chord of a circle makes complementary directed angles with the tangents to the circle at its endpoints. Hence,

$$
\sphericalangle(B Y, B I)+\sphericalangle(C I, C Y)=\sphericalangle(I B, \ell)+\sphericalangle(\ell, I C)=\sphericalangle(I B, I C) .
$$

Therefore,

$$
\begin{array}{r}
\sphericalangle(B Y, B A)+\sphericalangle(C A, C Y)=\sphericalangle(B I, B A)+\sphericalangle(B Y, B I)+\sphericalangle(C I, C Y)+\sphericalangle(C A, C I) \\
=\sphericalangle(B C, B I)+\sphericalangle(I B, I C)+\sphericalangle(C I, C B)=0,
\end{array}
$$

which yields $Y \in \Gamma$.

Step 2: We show that $X=\ell \cap E F$.

Let $X_{*}=\ell \cap E F$. To prove our claim, it suffices to show that $X_{*}$ lies on both $P M$ and $Q N$; this will yield $X_{*}=X$. Due to symmetry, it suffices to show $X_{*} \in Q N$.

Notice that

$$
\sphericalangle\left(I X_{*}, I Q\right)=\sphericalangle(C I, C Q)=\sphericalangle(C F, C Q)=\sphericalangle(E F, E Q)=\sphericalangle\left(E X_{*}, E Q\right) ;
$$



therefore, the points $X_{*}, I, Q$, and $E$ are concyclic (if $Q=E$, then the direction of $E Q$ is supposed to be the direction of a tangent to $\Gamma$ at $Q$; in this case, the equality means that the circle $\left(X_{*} I Q\right)$ is tangent to $\Gamma$ at $\left.Q\right)$. Then we have

$$
\sphericalangle\left(Q X_{*}, Q I\right)=\sphericalangle\left(E X_{*}, E I\right)=\sphericalangle(E F, E B)=\sphericalangle(C A, C F)=\sphericalangle(C N, C I)=\sphericalangle(Q N, Q I) \text {, }
$$

which shows that $X_{*} \in Q N$.

Step 3: We finally show that $A, X$, and $Y$ are collinear.

Recall that $I$ is the orthocenter of triangle $D E F$, and $A$ is symmetric to $I$ with respect to $E F$. Therefore,

$$
\sphericalangle(A X, A E)=\sphericalangle(I E, I X)=\sphericalangle(B I, \ell)=\sphericalangle(B Y, B I)=\sphericalangle(B Y, B E)=\sphericalangle(A Y, A E) \text {, }

Prove that there exists a positive constant $c$ such that the following statement is true:

Assume that $n$ is an integer with $n \geqslant 2$, and let $\mathcal{S}$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane such that the distance between any two distinct points in $\mathcal{S}$ is at least 1 . Then there is a line $\ell$ separating $\mathcal{S}$ such that the distance from any point of $\mathcal{S}$ to $\ell$ is at least $c n^{-1 / 3}$.

(A line $\ell$ separates a point set $\mathcal{S}$ if some segment joining two points in $\mathcal{S}$ crosses $\ell$.)
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric configuration of the points in the set $\mathcal{S}$. Given that the distance between any two points is at least 1, we can think about how to separate the points using a line. One way to approach this is to consider the convex hull of the points, which is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points. If the convex hull is a triangle, we can use the line that is the perpendicular bisector of the longest side of the triangle to separate the points. However, if the convex hull is not a triangle, we need to consider other lines that can separate the points.

A key observation is that if we have a set of points that are not too spread out, we can use a line that is not too far from the points. Specifically, if we have a set of points that are all within a certain distance from each other, we can use a line that is at least a fraction of the distance between the points. 

To formalize this, let's consider the points in a way that helps us to separate them. If we have a set of points that are all within a distance of $d$ from each other, we can use a line that is at least $d/n^{1/3}$ away from each point. This is because if we have $n$ points, and they are all within a distance of $d$ from each other, then the average distance between any two points is at most $d$. If we divide this average distance by $n^{1/3}$, we get a fraction that is at least $d/n^{1/3}$, which is the minimum distance from any point to the line that separates the points. </think>
<answer> c = 1 </answer>","We prove that the desired statement is true with $c=\frac{1}{8}$. Set $\delta=\frac{1}{8} n^{-1 / 3}$. For any line $\ell$ and any point $X$, let $X_{\ell}$ denote the projection of $X$ to $\ell$; a similar notation applies to sets of points.

Suppose that, for some line $\ell$, the set $\mathcal{S}_{\ell}$ contains two adjacent points $X$ and $Y$ with $X Y=2 d$. Then the line perpendicular to $\ell$ and passing through the midpoint of segment $X Y$ separates $\mathcal{S}$, and all points in $\mathcal{S}$ are at least $d$ apart from $\ell$. Thus, if $d \geqslant \delta$, then a desired line has been found. For the sake of contradiction, we assume that no such points exist, in any projection.

Choose two points $A$ and $B$ in $\mathcal{S}$ with the maximal distance $M=A B$ (i.e., $A B$ is a diameter of $\mathcal{S})$; by the problem condition, $M \geqslant 1$. Denote by $\ell$ the line $A B$. The set $\mathcal{S}$ is contained in the intersection of two disks $D_{A}$ and $D_{B}$ of radius $M$ centered at $A$ and $B$, respectively. Hence, the projection $\mathcal{S}_{\ell}$ is contained in the segment $A B$. Moreover, the points in $\mathcal{S}_{\ell}$ divide that segment into at most $n-1$ parts, each of length less than $2 \delta$. Therefore,

$$
M<n \cdot 2 \delta .
\tag{1}
$$

<img_3244>

Choose a point $H$ on segment $A B$ with $A H=\frac{1}{2}$. Let $P$ be a strip between the lines $a$ and $h$ perpendicular to $A B$ and passing through $A$ and $H$, respectively; we assume that $P$ contains its boundary, which consists of lines $a$ and $h$. Set $\mathcal{T}=P \cap \mathcal{S}$ and let $t=|\mathcal{T}|$. By our assumption, segment $A H$ contains at least $\left\lceil\frac{1}{2}:(2 \delta)\right\rceil$ points of $S_{\ell}$, which yields

$$
t \geqslant \frac{1}{4 \delta}\tag{2}
$$

Notice that $\mathcal{T}$ is contained in $Q=P \cap D_{B}$. The set $Q$ is a circular segment, and its projection $Q_{a}$ is a line segment of length

$$
2 \sqrt{M^{2}-\left(M-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}}<2 \sqrt{M}
$$

On the other hand, for any two points $X, Y \in \mathcal{T}$, we have $X Y \geqslant 1$ and $X_{\ell} Y_{\ell} \leqslant \frac{1}{2}$, so $X_{a} Y_{a}=$ $\sqrt{X Y^{2}-X_{\ell} Y_{\ell}^{2}} \geqslant \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. To summarize, $t$ points constituting $\mathcal{T}_{a}$ lie on the segment of length less than $2 \sqrt{M}$, and are at least $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ apart from each other. This yields $2 \sqrt{M}>(t-1) \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, or

$$
t<1+\frac{4 \sqrt{M}}{\sqrt{3}}<4 \sqrt{M}\tag{3}
$$



as $M \geqslant 1$.

Combining the estimates (1), (2), and (3), we finally obtain

$$
\frac{1}{4 \delta} \leqslant t<4 \sqrt{M}<4 \sqrt{2 n \delta}, \quad \text { or } \quad 512 n \delta^{3}>1
$$

which does not hold for the chosen value of $\delta$.",0,False,365

Given a positive integer $k$, show that there exists a prime $p$ such that one can choose distinct integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{k+3} \in\{1,2, \ldots, p-1\}$ such that $p$ divides $a_{i} a_{i+1} a_{i+2} a_{i+3}-i$ for all $i=1,2, \ldots, k$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression we need to satisfy: \( p \mid a_i a_{i+1} a_{i+2} a_{i+3} - i \). We need to find a prime \( p \) and distinct integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{k+3} \) in the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, p-1\}\) that make this true for all \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, k \).

A good strategy is to start with a small prime and see if we can find a suitable set of integers. Let's try with \( p = 5 \). We need to find five distinct integers from \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\) that can be used in the expression. </think>
<answer> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 </answer>","First we choose distinct positive rational numbers $r_{1}, \ldots, r_{k+3}$ such that

$$
r_{i} r_{i+1} r_{i+2} r_{i+3}=i \text { for } 1 \leqslant i \leqslant k .
$$

Let $r_{1}=x, r_{2}=y, r_{3}=z$ be some distinct primes greater than $k$; the remaining terms satisfy $r_{4}=\frac{1}{r_{1} r_{2} r_{3}}$ and $r_{i+4}=\frac{i+1}{i} r_{i}$. It follows that if $r_{i}$ are represented as irreducible fractions, the numerators are divisible by $x$ for $i \equiv 1(\bmod 4)$, by $y$ for $i \equiv 2(\bmod 4)$, by $z$ for $i \equiv 3(\bmod 4)$ and by none for $i \equiv 0(\bmod 4)$. Notice that $r_{i}<r_{i+4}$; thus the sequences $r_{1}<r_{5}<r_{9}<\ldots$, $r_{2}<r_{6}<r_{10}<\ldots, r_{3}<r_{7}<r_{11}<\ldots, r_{4}<r_{8}<r_{12}<\ldots$ are increasing and have no common terms, that is, all $r_{i}$ are distinct.

If each $r_{i}$ is represented by an irreducible fraction $\frac{u_{i}}{v_{i}}$, choose a prime $p$ which divides neither $v_{i}, 1 \leqslant i \leqslant k+1$, nor $v_{i} v_{j}\left(r_{i}-r_{j}\right)=v_{j} u_{i}-v_{i} u_{j}$ for $i<j$, and define $a_{i}$ by the congruence $a_{i} v_{i} \equiv u_{i}(\bmod p)$. Since $r_{i} r_{i+1} r_{i+2} r_{i+3}=i$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& i v_{i} v_{i+1} v_{i+2} v_{i+3}=r_{i} v_{i} r_{i+1} v_{i+1} r_{i+2} v_{i+2} r_{i+3} v_{i+3} \\

For each prime $p$, there is a kingdom of $p$-Landia consisting of $p$ islands numbered $1,2, \ldots, p$. Two distinct islands numbered $n$ and $m$ are connected by a bridge if and only if $p$ divides $\left(n^{2}-m+1\right)\left(m^{2}-n+1\right)$. The bridges may pass over each other, but cannot cross. Prove that for infinitely many $p$ there are two islands in $p$-Landia not connected by a chain of bridges.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression \((n^2 - m + 1)(m^2 - n + 1)\). We need to show that for infinitely many primes \(p\), there exist \(n\) and \(m\) such that this expression is divisible by \(p\), but the islands \(n\) and \(m\) are not directly connected by a bridge. 

Let's start by examining the expression modulo \(p\). If \(p\) divides \((n^2 - m + 1)(m^2 - n + 1)\), then \(p\) must divide at least one of the factors. We need to find a way to construct \(n\) and \(m\) such that one of the factors is divisible by \(p\), but the other is not, and thus, the islands are not directly connected by a bridge.

Consider the case when \(n = k p + r\) and \(m = k p + s\), where \(r, s \in \{1, 2, \ldots, p-1\}\). This means that \(n\) and \(m\) are congruent modulo \(p\), but not equal. Let's check the expression modulo \(p\):

\[
(n^2 - m + 1)(m^2 - n + 1) \equiv (r^2 - s + 1)(s^2 - r + 1) \pmod{p}
\]

Since \(r\) and \(s\) are distinct and not equal to 1, we can choose \(r\) and \(s\) such that one of the terms in the expression is divisible by \(p\), but the other is not. For example, if we choose \(r = 1\) and \(s = 2\), then:

\[
(1^2 - 2 + 1)(2^2 - 1 + 1) = 0 \cdot 3 = 0
\]

This shows that for \(p = 3\), the expression is divisible by 3, but the islands 1 and 2 are not directly connected by a bridge. </think>
<answer> For infinitely many primes \(p\), there exist \(n\) and \(m\) such that \((n^2 - m + 1)(m^2 - n + 1)\) is divisible by \(p\), but the islands \(n\) and \(m\) are not directly connected by a bridge. </answer>","We prove that for each prime $p>3$ dividing a number of the form $x^{2}-x+1$ with integer $x$ there are two unconnected islands in $p$-Landia.

For brevity's sake, when a bridge connects the islands numbered $m$ and $n$, we shall speak simply that it connects $m$ and $n$.

A bridge connects $m$ and $n$ if $n \equiv m^{2}+1(\bmod p)$ or $m \equiv n^{2}+1(\bmod p)$. If $m^{2}+1 \equiv n$ $(\bmod p)$, we draw an arrow starting at $m$ on the bridge connecting $m$ and $n$. Clearly only one arrow starts at $m$ if $m^{2}+1 \not \equiv m(\bmod p)$, and no arrows otherwise. The total number of bridges does not exceed the total number of arrows.

Suppose $x^{2}-x+1 \equiv 0(\bmod p)$. We may assume that $1 \leqslant x \leqslant p$; then there is no arrow starting at $x$. Since $(1-x)^{2}-(1-x)+1=x^{2}-x+1,(p+1-x)^{2}+1 \equiv(p+1-x)(\bmod p)$, and there is also no arrow starting at $p+1-x$. If $x=p+1-x$, that is, $x=\frac{p+1}{2}$, then $4\left(x^{2}-x+1\right)=p^{2}+3$ and therefore $x^{2}-x+1$ is not divisible by $p$. Thus the islands $x$ and $p+1-x$ are different, and no arrows start at either of them. It follows that the total number of bridges in $p$-Landia does not exceed $p-2$.

Let $1,2, \ldots, p$ be the vertices of a graph $G_{p}$, where an edge connects $m$ and $n$ if and only if there is a bridge between $m$ and $n$. The number of vertices of $G_{p}$ is $p$ and the number of edges is less than $p-1$. This means that the graph is not connected, which means that there are two islands not connected by a chain of bridges.

It remains to prove that there are infinitely many primes $p$ dividing $x^{2}-x+1$ for some integer $x$. Let $p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots, p_{k}$ be any finite set of such primes. The number $\left(p_{1} p_{2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_{k}\right)^{2}-p_{1} p_{2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_{k}+1$ is greater than 1 and not divisible by any $p_{i}$; therefore it has another prime divisor with the required property.",0,False,521

<answer>1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n</answer>","In all solutions, we call a set $\mathcal{S}$ of positive integers good if no its element is a sum of two other distinct members of $\mathcal{S}$. We will use the following simple observation.

Observation A. If $a, b$, and $c$ are three distinct elements of a good set $\mathcal{S}$ with $b>a, c$, then $b \nmid a+c$. Otherwise, since $b \neq a+c$, we would have $b \leqslant(a+c) / 2<\max \{a, c\}$.

We prove the following stronger statement.

Claim. Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a good set consisting of $n \geqslant 2$ positive integers. Then the elements of $\mathcal{S}$ may be ordered as $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ so that $a_{i} \nmid a_{i-1}+a_{i+1}$ and $a_{i} \nmid a_{i-1}-a_{i+1}$, for all $i=2,3, \ldots, n-1$.

Proof. Say that the ordering $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}$ of $\mathcal{S}$ is nice if it satisfies the required property.

We proceed by induction on $n$. The base case $n=2$ is trivial, as there are no restrictions on the ordering.

To perform the step of induction, suppose that $n \geqslant 3$. Let $a=\max \mathcal{S}$, and set $\mathcal{T}=\mathcal{S} \backslash\{a\}$. Use the inductive hypothesis to find a nice ordering $b_{1}, \ldots, b_{n-1}$ of $\mathcal{T}$. We will show that $a$ may be inserted into this sequence so as to reach a nice ordering of $\mathcal{S}$. In other words, we will show that there exists a $j \in\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ such that the ordering

$$
N_{j}=\left(b_{1}, \ldots, b_{j-1}, a, b_{j}, b_{j+1}, \ldots, b_{n-1}\right)
$$

is nice.

Assume that, for some $j$, the ordering $N_{j}$ is not nice, so that some element $x$ in it divides either the sum or the difference of two adjacent ones. This did not happen in the ordering of $\mathcal{T}$, hence $x \in\left\{b_{j-1}, a, b_{j}\right\}$ (if, say, $b_{j-1}$ does not exist, then $x \in\left\{a, b_{j}\right\}$; a similar agreement is applied hereafter). But the case $x=a$ is impossible: $a$ cannot divide $b_{j-1}-b_{j}$, since $0<\left|b_{j-1}-b_{j}\right|<a$, while $a \nmid b_{j-1}+b_{j}$ by Observation A. Therefore $x \in\left\{b_{j-1}, b_{j}\right\}$. In this case, assign the number $x$ to the index $j$.

Suppose now that none of the $N_{j}$ is nice. Since there are $n$ possible indices $j$, and only $n-1$ elements in $\mathcal{T}$, one of those elements (say, $b_{k}$ ) is assigned to two different indices, which then should equal $k$ and $k+1$. This means that $b_{k}$ divides the numbers $b_{k-1}+\varepsilon_{1} a$ and $a+\varepsilon_{2} b_{k+1}$, for some signs $\varepsilon_{1}, \varepsilon_{2} \in\{-1,1\}$. But then

$$
b_{k-1} \equiv-\varepsilon_{1} a \equiv \varepsilon_{1} \varepsilon_{2} b_{k+1} \quad\left(\bmod b_{k}\right)
$$

and therefore $b_{k} \mid b_{k-1}-\varepsilon_{1} \varepsilon_{2} b_{k+1}$, which means that the ordering of $\mathcal{T}$ was not nice. This contradiction proves the step of induction.",0,False,197

$$
u_{1}+u_{2}+\cdots+u_{2019}=0 \quad \text { and } \quad u_{1}^{2}+u_{2}^{2}+\cdots+u_{2019}^{2}=1 .
$$

Let $a=\min \left(u_{1}, u_{2}, \ldots, u_{2019}\right)$ and $b=\max \left(u_{1}, u_{2}, \ldots, u_{2019}\right)$. Prove that

$$
a b \leqslant-\frac{1}{2019}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions:
1. The sum of the numbers is zero: \( u_1 + u_2 + \cdots + u_{2019} = 0 \).
2. The sum of the squares of the numbers is one: \( u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \cdots + u_{2019}^2 = 1 \).

We need to prove that \( ab \leq -\frac{1}{2019} \), where \( a = \min(u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_{2019}) \) and \( b = \max(u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_{2019}) \).

Let's start by considering the possible values of \( a \) and \( b \). Since the sum of the numbers is zero, the maximum value \( b \) cannot be positive. If \( b \) were positive, then the sum of the numbers would be positive, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, \( b \leq 0 \).

Next, let's consider the sum of the squares. The sum of the squares is 1, and since \( b \leq 0 \), the contribution to the sum of squares from \( b \) must be small. If \( b \) were too large, the sum of the squares would be too large to be 1. Let's assume \( b = -k \) where \( k \) is a positive number. Then, the sum of the squares of the other 2018 numbers must be \( 1 + k^2 \).

Now, let's consider the minimum value \( a \). Since the sum of the numbers is zero, the minimum value \( a \) must be such that the sum of the other 2018 numbers is \( -a \). The sum of the squares of these 2018 numbers must be \( 1 - a^2 \). </think>
<answer> $$ ab = (-k) \cdot a = -ka = -\frac{1 + k^2}{2018} \leq -\frac{1}{2019} $$ </answer>","Notice first that $b>0$ and $a<0$. Indeed, since $\sum_{i=1}^{2019} u_{i}^{2}=1$, the variables $u_{i}$ cannot be all zero, and, since $\sum_{i=1}^{2019} u_{i}=0$, the nonzero elements cannot be all positive or all negative.

Let $P=\left\{i: u_{i}>0\right\}$ and $N=\left\{i: u_{i} \leqslant 0\right\}$ be the indices of positive and nonpositive elements in the sequence, and let $p=|P|$ and $n=|N|$ be the sizes of these sets; then $p+n=2019$. By the condition $\sum_{i=1}^{2019} u_{i}=0$ we have $0=\sum_{i=1}^{2019} u_{i}=\sum_{i \in P} u_{i}-\sum_{i \in N}\left|u_{i}\right|$, so

$$
\sum_{i \in P} u_{i}=\sum_{i \in N}\left|u_{i}\right|
\tag{1}
$$

After this preparation, estimate the sum of squares of the positive and nonpositive elements as follows:

$$
\sum_{i \in P} u_{i}^{2} \leqslant \sum_{i \in P} b u_{i}=b \sum_{i \in P} u_{i}=b \sum_{i \in N}\left|u_{i}\right| \leqslant b \sum_{i \in N}|a|=-n a b
\tag{2}
$$
$$
\sum_{i \in N} u_{i}^{2} \leqslant \sum_{i \in N}|a| \cdot\left|u_{i}\right|=|a| \sum_{i \in N}\left|u_{i}\right|=|a| \sum_{i \in P} u_{i} \leqslant|a| \sum_{i \in P} b=-p a b .
\tag{3}
$$

The sum of these estimates is

$$
1=\sum_{i=1}^{2019} u_{i}^{2}=\sum_{i \in P} u_{i}^{2}+\sum_{i \in N} u_{i}^{2} \leqslant-(p+n) a b=-2019 a b

Let $n \geqslant 3$ be a positive integer and let $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ be a strictly increasing sequence of $n$ positive real numbers with sum equal to 2 . Let $X$ be a subset of $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ such that the value of

$$
\left|1-\sum_{i \in X} a_{i}\right|
$$

is minimised. Prove that there exists a strictly increasing sequence of $n$ positive real numbers $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots, b_{n}\right)$ with sum equal to 2 such that

$$
\sum_{i \in X} b_{i}=1
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given sequence \((a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)\) which is strictly increasing and has a sum of 2. We need to find a subset \(X\) of \(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) such that the expression \(\left|1 - \sum_{i \in X} a_i\right|\) is minimized. This means that \(\sum_{i \in X} a_i\) should be as close to 1 as possible. 

Since the sequence is strictly increasing, the sum of the first \(k\) terms, \(\sum_{i=1}^k a_i\), is a strictly increasing function of \(k\). The sum of all terms is 2, so the sum of the first \(k\) terms will be less than 1 for \(k > 1\). This suggests that the subset \(X\) might be the set of the first \(k-1\) terms, where \(k-1 < k\).

Now, let's consider the sequence \((b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n)\) where \(b_i = a_i - a_{i+1}\) for \(i = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\) and \(b_n = a_n\). This sequence is strictly increasing because each term is the difference of two strictly increasing terms. The sum of this sequence is:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n b_i = \sum_{i=1}^n (a_i - a_{i+1}) = a_1 - a_2 + a_2 - a_3 + \cdots + a_{n-1} - a_n + a_n = 2
\]
We need to check if \(\sum_{i \in X} b_i = 1\). If \(X = \{1, 2, \ldots, k-1\}\), then:
\[
\sum_{i \in X} b_i = b_1 + b_2 + \cdots + b_{k-1} = (a_1 - a_2) + (a_2 - a_3) + \cdots + (a_{k-1} - a_k) = a_1 - a_k
\]
Since \(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k = 1\), it follows that \(a_1 - a_k = 1\). </think>
<answer> (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n) = (a_1 - a_2, a_2 - a_3, \ldots, a_{n-1} - a_n, a_n) </answer>","we say an index set $X$ is $\left(a_{i}\right)$-minimising if it has the property in the problem for the given sequence $\left(a_{i}\right)$. Write $X^{c}$ for the complement of $X$, and $[a, b]$ for the interval of integers $k$ such that $a \leqslant k \leqslant b$. Note that

$$
\left|1-\sum_{i \in X} a_{i}\right|=\left|1-\sum_{i \in X^{c}} a_{i}\right|
$$

so we may exchange $X$ and $X^{c}$ where convenient. Let

$$
\Delta=\sum_{i \in X^{c}} a_{i}-\sum_{i \in X} a_{i}
$$

and note that $X$ is $\left(a_{i}\right)$-minimising if and only if it minimises $|\Delta|$, and that $\sum_{i \in X} a_{i}=1$ if and only if $\Delta=0$.

If we have a strictly increasing sequence of positive real numbers $c_{i}$ (typically obtained by perturbing the $a_{i}$ in some way) such that

$$
\sum_{i \in X} c_{i}=\sum_{i \in X^{c}} c_{i}
$$

then we may put $b_{i}=2 c_{i} / \sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{j}$. So it suffices to construct such a sequence without needing its sum to be 2 .


Without loss of generality, assume $\sum_{i \in X} a_{i} \leqslant 1$, and we may assume strict inequality as otherwise $b_{i}=a_{i}$ works. Also, $X$ clearly cannot be empty.

If $n \in X$, add $\Delta$ to $a_{n}$, producing a sequence of $c_{i}$ with $\sum_{i \in X} c_{i}=\sum_{i \in X^{c}} c_{i}$, and then scale as described above to make the sum equal to 2 . Otherwise, there is some $k$ with $k \in X$ and $k+1 \in X^{c}$. Let $\delta=a_{k+1}-a_{k}$.

- If $\delta>\Delta$, add $\Delta$ to $a_{k}$ and then scale.
- If $\delta<\Delta$, then considering $X \cup\{k+1\} \backslash\{k\}$ contradicts $X$ being $\left(a_{i}\right)$-minimising.
- If $\delta=\Delta$, choose any $j \neq k, k+1$ (possible since $n \geqslant 3$ ), and any $\epsilon$ less than the least of $a_{1}$ and all the differences $a_{i+1}-a_{i}$. If $j \in X$ then add $\Delta-\epsilon$ to $a_{k}$ and $\epsilon$ to $a_{j}$, then scale; otherwise, add $\Delta$ to $a_{k}$ and $\epsilon / 2$ to $a_{k+1}$, and subtract $\epsilon / 2$ from $a_{j}$, then scale.",0,False,602

Let $n \geqslant 2$ be a positive integer and $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be real numbers such that

$$
a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}=0 .
$$

Define the set $A$ by

$$
A=\left\{(i, j)|1 \leqslant i<j \leqslant n,| a_{i}-a_{j} \mid \geqslant 1\right\} .
$$

Prove that, if $A$ is not empty, then

$$
\sum_{(i, j) \in A} a_{i} a_{j}<0
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the set \( A \). The set \( A \) consists of all pairs \((i, j)\) such that \(1 \leq i < j \leq n\) and \(|a_i - a_j| \geq 1\). We need to show that if \(A\) is not empty, then the sum of the products of the elements in these pairs is negative, i.e., \(\sum_{(i, j) \in A} a_i a_j < 0\).

Since \(A\) is not empty, there exists at least one pair \((i, j)\) such that \(|a_i - a_j| \geq 1\). Let's consider the sum of the products of the elements in these pairs. We can write the sum as:
\[
\sum_{(i, j) \in A} a_i a_j = \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} a_i a_j \text{ where } |a_i - a_j| \geq 1.
\]

To proceed, let's consider the structure of the sum. We can break it down by considering the contribution of each pair \((i, j)\) to the sum. If we have a pair \((i, j)\) such that \(|a_i - a_j| \geq 1\), then the product \(a_i a_j\) will be negative or positive depending on the signs of \(a_i\) and \(a_j\). However, since the absolute difference is at least 1, the magnitude of the product will be large enough to make the sum negative when combined with other terms.

To see this more clearly, let's consider a specific example. Suppose we have \(a_1 = 1\), \(a_2 = 2\), and \(a_3 = -3\). Then, the set \(A\) would be \(\{(1, 2), (1, 3)\}\) because \(|1 - 2| = 1\) and \(|1 - (-3)| = 4\). The sum of the products is:
\[
a_1 a_2 + a_1 a_3 = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot (-3) = 2 - 3 = -1.
\]
This example shows that the sum of the products of the elements in the set \(A\) is indeed negative when \(A\) is not empty. </think>
<answer> \sum_{(i, j) \in A} a_i a_j < 0 </answer>","Define sets $B$ and $C$ by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& B=\left\{(i, j)|1 \leqslant i, j \leqslant n,| a_{i}-a_{j} \mid \geqslant 1\right\}, \\
& C=\left\{(i, j)|1 \leqslant i, j \leqslant n,| a_{i}-a_{j} \mid<1\right\} .
\end{aligned}
$$

We have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{(i, j) \in A} a_{i} a_{j} & =\frac{1}{2} \sum_{(i, j) \in B} a_{i} a_{j} \\
\sum_{(i, j) \in B} a_{i} a_{j} & =\sum_{1 \leqslant i, j \leqslant n} a_{i} a_{j}-\sum_{(i, j) \notin B} a_{i} a_{j}=0-\sum_{(i, j) \in C} a_{i} a_{j} .
\end{aligned}
$$

So it suffices to show that if $A$ (and hence $B$ ) are nonempty, then

$$
\sum_{(i, j) \in C} a_{i} a_{j}>0
$$

Partition the indices into sets $P, Q, R$, and $S$ such that

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
P=\left\{i \mid a_{i} \leqslant-1\right\} & R=\left\{i \mid 0<a_{i}<1\right\} \\
Q=\left\{i \mid-1<a_{i} \leqslant 0\right\} & S=\left\{i \mid 1 \leqslant a_{i}\right\} .
\end{array}
$$

Then

$$
\sum_{(i, j) \in C} a_{i} a_{j} \geqslant \sum_{i \in P \cup S} a_{i}^{2}+\sum_{i, j \in Q \cup R} a_{i} a_{j}=\sum_{i \in P \cup S} a_{i}^{2}+\left(\sum_{i \in Q \cup R} a_{i}\right)^{2} \geqslant 0 .
$$

The first inequality holds because all of the positive terms in the RHS are also in the LHS, and all of the negative terms in the LHS are also in the RHS. The first inequality attains equality only if both sides have the same negative terms, which implies $\left|a_{i}-a_{j}\right|<1$ whenever $i, j \in Q \cup R$; the second inequality attains equality only if $P=S=\varnothing$. But then we would have $A=\varnothing$. So $A$ nonempty implies that the inequality holds strictly, as required.",0,False,555

Let $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$ be different real numbers. Prove that

$$
\sum_{1 \leqslant i \leqslant n} \prod_{j \neq i} \frac{1-x_{i} x_{j}}{x_{i}-x_{j}}= \begin{cases}0, & \text { if } n \text { is even } \\ 1, & \text { if } n \text { is odd }\end{cases}

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression we need to evaluate: 
\[
\sum_{1 \leqslant i \leqslant n} \prod_{j \neq i} \frac{1-x_{i} x_{j}}{x_{i}-x_{j}}
\]
We need to show that this expression equals 0 when \( n \) is even and 1 when \( n \) is odd. 

Let's start by examining the product term:
\[
\prod_{j \neq i} \frac{1-x_{i} x_{j}}{x_{i}-x_{j}}
\]
This product is taken over all \( j \) except \( i \). If we consider the polynomial \( P(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n (x - x_i) \), then the expression can be rewritten in terms of the roots of this polynomial. 

Now, let's consider the polynomial \( Q(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n (1 - x x_i) \). The roots of \( Q(x) \) are the reciprocals of the roots of \( P(x) \). 

The expression we are evaluating is essentially the sum of the values of \( Q(x) \) at the points \( x_i \). 

When \( n \) is odd, the polynomial \( Q(x) \) has an odd number of roots, and the sum of the values of a polynomial at its roots (counting multiplicities) is 1. 

When \( n \) is even, the polynomial \( Q(x) \) has an even number of roots, and the sum of the values of a polynomial at its roots (counting multiplicities) is 0. </think>
<answer> \begin{cases}0, & \text{ if } n \text{ is even} \\ 1, & \text{ if } n \text{ is odd} \end{cases} </answer>","Since both sides of the identity are rational functions, it suffices to prove it when all $x_{i} \notin\{ \pm 1\}$. Define

$$
f(t)=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(1-x_{i} t\right)
$$

and note that

$$
f\left(x_{i}\right)=\left(1-x_{i}^{2}\right) \prod_{j \neq i} 1-x_{i} x_{j}
$$

Using the nodes $+1,-1, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}$, the Lagrange interpolation formula gives us the following expression for $f$ :

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} f\left(x_{i}\right) \frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{\left(x_{i}-1\right)\left(x_{i}+1\right)} \prod_{j \neq i} \frac{x-x_{j}}{x_{i}-x_{j}}+f(1) \frac{x+1}{1+1} \prod_{1 \leqslant i \leqslant n} \frac{x-x_{i}}{1-x_{i}}+f(-1) \frac{x-1}{-1-1} \prod_{1 \leqslant i \leqslant n} \frac{x-x_{i}}{1-x_{i}}
$$

The coefficient of $t^{n+1}$ in $f(t)$ is 0 , since $f$ has degree $n$. The coefficient of $t^{n+1}$ in the above expression of $f$ is

A polynomial $P(x, y, z)$ in three variables with real coefficients satisfies the identities

$$
P(x, y, z)=P(x, y, x y-z)=P(x, z x-y, z)=P(y z-x, y, z)
\tag{*}
$$

Prove that there exists a polynomial $F(t)$ in one variable such that

$$
P(x, y, z)=F\left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-x y z\right)
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given identities. The polynomial \(P(x, y, z)\) is invariant under the transformations:
1. \(P(x, y, z) = P(x, y, x y - z)\)
2. \(P(x, y, z) = P(x, z x - y, z)\)
3. \(P(x, y, z) = P(y z - x, y, z)\)

We need to show that there exists a polynomial \(F(t)\) such that \(P(x, y, z) = F(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - x y z)\).

Let's start by considering the expression \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - x y z\). We need to see if this expression can be used to define a polynomial that is invariant under the given transformations. 

One way to approach this is to consider the possibility that the polynomial \(P(x, y, z)\) might be a function of the expression \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - x y z\). Let's denote this expression by \(t\), i.e., \(t = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - x y z\). 

Now, we need to check if the polynomial \(P(x, y, z)\) can be expressed as a function of \(t\). 

Given the invariance under the transformations, we can try to find a polynomial \(F(t)\) such that \(P(x, y, z) = F(t)\). 

To do this, we can use the fact that the polynomial \(P(x, y, z)\) is invariant under the transformations, and thus, it must be a function of the expression that remains invariant under these transformations. 

Let's consider the expression \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - x y z\). If we can show that this expression is invariant under the given transformations, then it must be that \(P(x, y, z) = F(t)\) for some polynomial \(F(t)\). 

</think>
<answer> P(x, y, z) = F(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - x y z) </answer>","In the first two steps, we deal with any polynomial $P(x, y, z)$ satisfying $P(x, y, z)=$ $P(x, y, x y-z)$. Call such a polynomial weakly symmetric, and call a polynomial satisfying the full conditions in the problem symmetric.

Step 1. We start with the description of weakly symmetric polynomials. We claim that they are exactly the polynomials in $x, y$, and $z(x y-z)$. Clearly, all such polynomials are weakly symmetric. For the converse statement, consider $P_{1}(x, y, z):=P\left(x, y, z+\frac{1}{2} x y\right)$, which satisfies $P_{1}(x, y, z)=P_{1}(x, y,-z)$ and is therefore a polynomial in $x, y$, and $z^{2}$. This means that $P$ is a polynomial in $x, y$, and $\left(z-\frac{1}{2} x y\right)^{2}=-z(x y-z)+\frac{1}{4} x^{2} y^{2}$, and therefore a polynomial in $x, y$, and $z(x y-z)$.

Step 2. Suppose that $P$ is weakly symmetric. Consider the monomials in $P(x, y, z)$ of highest total degree. Our aim is to show that in each such monomial $\mu x^{a} y^{b} z^{c}$ we have $a, b \geqslant c$. Consider the expansion

$$
P(x, y, z)=\sum_{i, j, k} \mu_{i j k} x^{i} y^{j}(z(x y-z))^{k}
\tag{1.1}
$$

The maximal total degree of a summand in (1.1) is $m=\max _{i, j, k: \mu_{i j k} \neq 0}(i+j+3 k)$. Now, for any $i, j, k$ satisfying $i+j+3 k=m$ the summand $\mu_{i, j, k} x^{i} y^{j}(z(x y-z))^{k}$ has leading term of the form $\mu x^{i+k} y^{j+k} z^{k}$. No other nonzero summand in (1.1) may have a term of this form in its expansion, hence this term does not cancel in the whole sum. Therefore, $\operatorname{deg} P=m$, and the leading component of $P$ is exactly

$$
\sum_{i+j+3 k=m} \mu_{i, j, k} x^{i+k} y^{j+k} z^{k}
$$

and each summand in this sum satisfies the condition claimed above.

Step 3. We now prove the problem statement by induction on $m=\operatorname{deg} P$. For $m=0$ the claim is trivial. Consider now a symmetric polynomial $P$ with $\operatorname{deg} P>0$. By Step 2, each of its monomials $\mu x^{a} y^{b} z^{c}$ of the highest total degree satisfies $a, b \geqslant c$. Applying other weak symmetries, we obtain $a, c \geqslant b$ and $b, c \geqslant a$; therefore, $P$ has a unique leading monomial of the form $\mu(x y z)^{c}$. The polynomial $P_{0}(x, y, z)=P(x, y, z)-\mu\left(x y z-x^{2}-y^{2}-z^{2}\right)^{c}$ has smaller total degree. Since $P_{0}$ is symmetric, it is representable as a polynomial function of $x y z-x^{2}-y^{2}-z^{2}$. Then $P$ is also of this form, completing the inductive step.",0,False,475

Prove that there exists such a function $f$ for which there is an $f$-rare integer.

","First, let's analyze the given functional equation: 
$$f(f(x+y)+y) = f(f(x)+y).$$
We need to find a function $f$ that satisfies this equation and has an $f$-rare integer. Let's start by considering the possibility that $f$ is a constant function. If $f(x) = c$ for all $x$, then the equation becomes:
$$f(c + y) = f(c),$$
which is true for any constant $c$. However, this function does not have any $f$-rare integers since the set $X_v$ is empty for any $v$.

Next, let's consider if $f$ can be a non-constant function. We need to find a function that satisfies the equation and has a finite, nonempty set $X_v$ for some $v$. One approach is to look for a function that maps integers to a small set of values. </think>

This equation holds true for all integers $x$ and $y$.
Now, let's check if this function has an $f$-rare integer. The set $X_v$ for $v = 0$ is the set of all even integers, which is infinite. The set $X_v$ for $v = 1$ is the set of all odd integers, which is also infinite.

Since $f(2 x)=2 f(x)$ for all $x$, it suffices to verify the functional equation when at least one of $x$ and $y$ is odd (the case $x=y=0$ being trivial). If $y$ is odd, then we have

$$
f(f(x+y)+y)=2=f(f(x)+y)
$$

since all the values attained by $f$ are even. If, on the other hand, $x$ is odd and $y$ is even, then we already have

","First, let's analyze the given functional equation: 
$$f(f(x+y)+y) = f(f(x)+y).$$
We need to show that there can be at most one $f$-rare integer. Let's start by considering the possibility that there are two distinct $f$-rare integers, say $v$ and $w$.

If $v$ and $w$ are both $f$-rare, then the sets $X_v$ and $X_w$ are finite and nonempty. This means there are integers $a$ and $b$ such that $f(a) = v$ and $f(b) = w$. 

Now, let's consider the equation with $x = a$ and $y = b - a$. We get:
$$f(f(a + (b - a)) + (b - a)) = f(f(a) + (b - a)).$$
This simplifies to:
$$f(f(b) + (b - a)) = f(v + (b - a)).$$
Since $f(b) = w$, we have:
$$f(w + (b - a)) = f(v + (b - a)).$$
This implies that $w = v$ because the function $f$ is applied to the same argument on both sides, and the only way for these to be equal is if the arguments themselves are equal. This contradicts our assumption that $v$ and $w$ are distinct. </think>

f(x+k \cdot(a-f(x))) \geqslant f(x)
$$

for all integers $x$ and $k$, by assumption on $a$. This says that on the (possibly degenerate) arithmetic progression through $x$ with common difference $a-f(x)$, the function $f$ attains its minimal value at $x$.

Repeating the same argument with $a$ replaced by the greatest element $b$ of $X_{v}$ shows that

$$
f(x+k \cdot(b-f(x)) \leqslant f(x)
$$

for all integers $x$ and $k$. Combined with the above inequality, we therefore have

$$
f(x+k \cdot(a-f(x)) \cdot(b-f(x)))=f(x)
$$

for all integers $x$ and $k$.

Thus if $f(x) \neq a, b$, then the set $X_{f(x)}$ contains a nondegenerate arithmetic progression, so is infinite. So the only possible $f$-rare integers are $a$ and $b$.

In particular, the $f$-rare integer $v$ we started with must be one of $a$ or $b$, so that $f(v)=$ $f(a)=f(b)=v$. This means that there cannot be any other $f$-rare integers $v^{\prime}$, as they would on the one hand have to be either $a$ or $b$, and on the other would have to satisfy $f\left(v^{\prime}\right)=v^{\prime}$. Thus $v$ is the unique $f$-rare integer.",0,True,337

The infinite sequence $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots$ of (not necessarily different) integers has the following properties: $0 \leqslant a_{i} \leqslant i$ for all integers $i \geqslant 0$, and

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}
k \\
a_{0}
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}
k \\
a_{1}
\end{array}\right)+\cdots+\left(\begin{array}{c}

\end{array}\right)=2^{k}
$$

for all integers $k \geqslant 0$.

Prove that all integers $N \geqslant 0$ occur in the sequence (that is, for all $N \geqslant 0$, there exists $i \geqslant 0$ with $a_{i}=N$ ).
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given properties of the sequence. We know that $0 \leqslant a_{i} \leqslant i$ for all integers $i \geqslant 0$, and that the sum of binomial coefficients with these indices equals $2^k$ for all integers $k \geqslant 0$. This is a strong hint that the sequence might be related to binomial coefficients, but with a twist. 

Let's start by examining the case when $k = 0$. The sum of binomial coefficients is $1$, which is indeed $2^0$. This suggests that $a_0 = 0$.

Next, let's consider $k = 1$. The sum of binomial coefficients is $1 + 1 = 2$, which is $2^1$. This suggests that $a_1 = 1$.

Now, let's consider $k = 2$. The sum of binomial coefficients is $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$, which is $2^2$. This suggests that $a_2 = 2$.

We can see a pattern emerging: $a_i = i$ for $i = 0, 1, 2$. Let's check if this pattern holds for other values of $k$.

For $k = 3$, the sum of binomial coefficients is $1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8$, which is $2^3$. This suggests that $a_3 = 3$.

By induction, we can see that $a_i = i$ for all $i \geqslant 0$. This means that every integer $N \geqslant 0$ occurs in the sequence, as $a_i = i$ for $i = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, N$.

</think>
<answer> a_i = i </answer>","We prove by induction on $k$ that every initial segment of the sequence, $a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots, a_{k}$, consists of the following elements (counted with multiplicity, and not necessarily in order), for some $\ell \geqslant 0$ with $2 \ell \leqslant k+1$ :

$$
0,1, \ldots, \ell-1, \quad 0,1, \ldots, k-\ell
$$

For $k=0$ we have $a_{0}=0$, which is of this form. Now suppose that for $k=m$ the elements $a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m}$ are $0,0,1,1,2,2, \ldots, \ell-1, \ell-1, \ell, \ell+1, \ldots, m-\ell-1, m-\ell$ for some $\ell$ with $0 \leqslant 2 \ell \leqslant m+1$. It is given that

a_{m}
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}

m-\ell
\end{array}\right)\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}
m+1 \\
a_{m+1}
\end{array}\right)=2^{m+1},

$$

or, using $\left(\begin{array}{c}m+1 \\ i\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}m+1 \\ m+1-i\end{array}\right)$, that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(\left(\begin{array}{c}

\end{array}\right)\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}
m+1 \\
a_{m+1}

On the other hand, it is well known that

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}
m+1 \\
0

m+1 \\
1
\end{array}\right)+\cdots+\left(\begin{array}{c}
m+1 \\
m+1
\end{array}\right)=2^{m+1}
$$

and so, by subtracting, we get

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}
m+1 \\
a_{m+1}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
m+1 \\
\ell
\end{array}\right)
$$

From this, using the fact that the binomial coefficients $\left(\begin{array}{c}m+1 \\ i\end{array}\right)$ are increasing for $i \leqslant \frac{m+1}{2}$ and decreasing for $i \geqslant \frac{m+1}{2}$, we conclude that either $a_{m+1}=\ell$ or $a_{m+1}=m+1-\ell$. In either case, $a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m+1}$ is again of the claimed form, which concludes the induction.

As a result of this description, any integer $N \geqslant 0$ appears as a term of the sequence $a_{i}$ for some $0 \leqslant i \leqslant 2 N$.",0,False,411

You are given a set of $n$ blocks, each weighing at least 1 ; their total weight is $2 n$. Prove that for every real number $r$ with $0 \leqslant r \leqslant 2 n-2$ you can choose a subset of the blocks whose total weight is at least $r$ but at most $r+2$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions: we have $n$ blocks, each weighing at least 1, and their total weight is $2n$. We need to show that for any real number $r$ in the range $0 \leq r \leq 2n-2$, we can choose a subset of these blocks whose total weight is at least $r$ but at most $r+2$.
Let's start by considering the extreme cases. If $r = 0$, we need to find a subset of the blocks whose total weight is at most 2. This is possible by choosing the two lightest blocks, as their combined weight is at most 2. If $r = 2n-2$, we need to find a subset of the blocks whose total weight is at least 2. This is also possible by choosing the two heaviest blocks, as their combined weight is at least 2.
Now, let's consider the general case where $0 < r < 2n-2$. We need to find a subset of the blocks whose total weight is at least $r$ but at most $r+2$. We can use the fact that the total weight of all blocks is $2n$ to our advantage. If we can find a subset whose weight is close to $r$, we can adjust it slightly to reach the exact value of $r$ or $r+2$.
One approach is to start by considering the two heaviest blocks. If their combined weight is less than $r+2$, we can add the lightest block to reach the required weight. If their combined weight is more than $r+2$, we can remove the lightest block to get closer to $r$.
</think>
<answer> Given the total weight of the blocks is $2n$, and considering the weights of the blocks, we can always find a subset that meets the criteria. Specifically, if we have two heaviest blocks, we can adjust their combined weight by adding or removing the lightest block to get the required weight. </answer>","We prove the following more general statement by induction on $n$.

Claim. Suppose that you have $n$ blocks, each of weight at least 1 , and of total weight $s \leqslant 2 n$. Then for every $r$ with $-2 \leqslant r \leqslant s$, you can choose some of the blocks whose total weight is at least $r$ but at most $r+2$.

Proof. The base case $n=1$ is trivial. To prove the inductive step, let $x$ be the largest block weight. Clearly, $x \geqslant s / n$, so $s-x \leqslant \frac{n-1}{n} s \leqslant 2(n-1)$. Hence, if we exclude a block of weight $x$, we can apply the inductive hypothesis to show the claim holds (for this smaller set) for any $-2 \leqslant r \leqslant s-x$. Adding the excluded block to each of those combinations, we see that the claim also holds when $x-2 \leqslant r \leqslant s$. So if $x-2 \leqslant s-x$, then we have covered the whole interval $[-2, s]$. But each block weight is at least 1 , so we have $x-2 \leqslant(s-(n-1))-2=s-(2 n-(n-1)) \leqslant s-(s-(n-1)) \leqslant s-x$, as desired.",0,False,430

On a certain social network, there are 2019 users, some pairs of which are friends, where friendship is a symmetric relation. Initially, there are 1010 people with 1009 friends each and 1009 people with 1010 friends each. However, the friendships are rather unstable, so events of the following kind may happen repeatedly, one at a time:

Let $A, B$, and $C$ be people such that $A$ is friends with both $B$ and $C$, but $B$ and $C$ are not friends; then $B$ and $C$ become friends, but $A$ is no longer friends with them.

Prove that, regardless of the initial friendships, there exists a sequence of such events after which each user is friends with at most one other user.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the initial state of the network. We have 2019 users, with 1010 users having 1009 friends each and 1009 users having 1010 friends each. This means that the total number of friendships is 1010 * 1009 = 1019009, which is an odd number. 

The events described in the problem involve a user $A$ who is friends with both $B$ and $C$, but $B$ and $C$ are not friends. After the event, $B$ and $C$ become friends, but $A$ is no longer friends with them. This means that the total number of friendships remains the same, but the structure of the friendships changes. 

We need to show that there exists a sequence of such events that results in each user being friends with at most one other user. 

Consider the following strategy: 
1. Identify a user $A$ who has 1009 friends and is not friends with any of the 1009 users who have 1010 friends. 
2. Perform the event with $A$ and one of the 1009 users with 1010 friends, say $B$. This will make $B$ and $A$ friends, and $B$ will no longer be friends with any of the other 1009 users. 
3. Now, $B$ has 1010 friends, and $A$ has 1010 friends. 
4. Repeat the process with another user $C$ who has 1009 friends and is not friends with any of the remaining 1008 users, and so on. 

By following this strategy, we can ensure that each user is eventually friends with at most one other user. </think>
<answer> ... ... ... </answer>","The problem has an obvious rephrasing in terms of graph theory. One is given a graph $G$ with 2019 vertices, 1010 of which have degree 1009 and 1009 of which have degree 1010. One is allowed to perform operations on $G$ of the following kind:

Suppose that vertex $A$ is adjacent to two distinct vertices $B$ and $C$ which are not adjacent to each other. Then one may remove the edges $A B$ and $A C$ from $G$ and add the edge $B C$ into $G$.

Call such an operation a refriending. One wants to prove that, via a sequence of such refriendings, one can reach a graph which is a disjoint union of single edges and vertices.


Note that the given graph is connected, since the total degree of any two vertices is at least 2018 and hence they are either adjacent or have at least one neighbour in common. Hence the given graph satisfies the following condition:
$$
\text{Every connected component of $G$ with at least three vertices is not complete and has a vertex of odd degree.}
\tag{1}
$$
We will show that if a graph $G$ satisfies condition (1) and has a vertex of degree at least 2 , then there is a refriending on $G$ that preserves condition (1). Since refriendings decrease the total number of edges of $G$, by using a sequence of such refriendings, we must reach a graph $G$ with maximal degree at most 1 , so we are done.

<img_3653>



Pick a vertex $A$ of degree at least 2 in a connected component $G^{\prime}$ of $G$. Since no component of $G$ with at least three vertices is complete we may assume that not all of the neighbours of $A$ are adjacent to one another. (For example, pick a maximal complete subgraph $K$ of $G^{\prime}$. Some vertex $A$ of $K$ has a neighbour outside $K$, and this neighbour is not adjacent to every vertex of $K$ by maximality.) Removing $A$ from $G$ splits $G^{\prime}$ into smaller connected components $G_{1}, \ldots, G_{k}$ (possibly with $k=1$ ), to each of which $A$ is connected by at least one edge. We divide into several cases.

Case 1: $k \geqslant 2$ and $A$ is connected to some $G_{i}$ by at least two edges.

Choose a vertex $B$ of $G_{i}$ adjacent to $A$, and a vertex $C$ in another component $G_{j}$ adjacent to $A$. The vertices $B$ and $C$ are not adjacent, and hence removing edges $A B$ and $A C$ and adding in edge $B C$ does not disconnect $G^{\prime}$. It is easy to see that this preserves the condition, since the refriending does not change the parity of the degrees of vertices.

Case 2: $k \geqslant 2$ and $A$ is connected to each $G_{i}$ by exactly one edge.

Consider the induced subgraph on any $G_{i}$ and the vertex $A$. The vertex $A$ has degree 1 in this subgraph; since the number of odd-degree vertices of a graph is always even, we see that $G_{i}$ has a vertex of odd degree (in $G$ ). Thus if we let $B$ and $C$ be any distinct neighbours of $A$, then removing edges $A B$ and $A C$ and adding in edge $B C$ preserves the above condition: the refriending creates two new components, and if either of these components has at least three vertices, then it cannot be complete and must contain a vertex of odd degree (since each $G_{i}$ does).

Case 3: $k=1$ and $A$ is connected to $G_{1}$ by at least three edges.

By assumption, $A$ has two neighbours $B$ and $C$ which are not adjacent to one another. Removing edges $A B$ and $A C$ and adding in edge $B C$ does not disconnect $G^{\prime}$. We are then done as in Case 1.

Case 4: $k=1$ and $A$ is connected to $G_{1}$ by exactly two edges.

Let $B$ and $C$ be the two neighbours of $A$, which are not adjacent. Removing edges $A B$ and $A C$ and adding in edge $B C$ results in two new components: one consisting of a single vertex; and the other containing a vertex of odd degree. We are done unless this second component would be a complete graph on at least 3 vertices. But in this case, $G_{1}$ would be a complete graph minus the single edge $B C$, and hence has at least 4 vertices since $G^{\prime}$ is not a 4-cycle. If we let $D$ be a third vertex of $G_{1}$, then removing edges $B A$ and $B D$ and adding in edge $A D$ does not disconnect $G^{\prime}$. We are then done as in Case 1.

Let $n>1$ be an integer. Suppose we are given $2 n$ points in a plane such that no three of them are collinear. The points are to be labelled $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{2 n}$ in some order. We then consider the $2 n$ angles $\angle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}, \angle A_{2} A_{3} A_{4}, \ldots, \angle A_{2 n-2} A_{2 n-1} A_{2 n}, \angle A_{2 n-1} A_{2 n} A_{1}$, $\angle A_{2 n} A_{1} A_{2}$. We measure each angle in the way that gives the smallest positive value (i.e. between $0^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$ ). Prove that there exists an ordering of the given points such that the resulting $2 n$ angles can be separated into two groups with the sum of one group of angles equal to the sum of the other group.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the sum of all the angles. Since each angle is between $0^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$, the sum of all $2n$ angles is between $0^{\circ}$ and $360^{\circ}$. We need to show that this sum can be split into two groups of $n$ angles each, with the sum of one group equal to the sum of the other group. 

To do this, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a circle is $360^{\circ}$. If we can find a way to split the angles into two groups that each sum to $180^{\circ}$, then we have our solution. 

One way to approach this is to consider the possibility of having a set of angles that are symmetric around $180^{\circ}$. If we can find such a set, then we can split the angles into two groups, each summing to $180^{\circ}$. 

For example, if we have an angle of $120^{\circ}$, we can pair it with an angle of $60^{\circ}$ to make $180^{\circ}$. Similarly, if we have an angle of $150^{\circ}$, we can pair it with an angle of $30^{\circ}$ to make $180^{\circ}$.

Alice has a map of Wonderland, a country consisting of $n \geqslant 2$ towns. For every pair of towns, there is a narrow road going from one town to the other. One day, all the roads are declared to be ""one way"" only. Alice has no information on the direction of the roads, but the King of Hearts has offered to help her. She is allowed to ask him a number of questions. For each question in turn, Alice chooses a pair of towns and the King of Hearts tells her the direction of the road connecting those two towns.

Alice wants to know whether there is at least one town in Wonderland with at most one outgoing road. Prove that she can always find out by asking at most $4 n$ questions.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the problem. We have $n$ towns, and each town can have at most one outgoing road. We need to determine if there is at least one town with at most one outgoing road by asking the King of Hearts about the direction of the roads between pairs of towns. 

We can start by considering the possibility that each town has exactly one outgoing road. If this is true, then we can easily identify the town with the single road by asking about the direction of the roads between all pairs of towns. However, if this is not the case, we need to consider the possibility that some towns have more than one outgoing road. 

To address this, we can use a strategy that involves asking about the direction of roads between all pairs of towns. We can start by asking about the direction of the roads between the first two towns. If the road from the first town to the second town is directed from the first to the second, then we know that the first town has at least one outgoing road. If the road is directed from the second to the first, then we know that the second town has at least one outgoing road. 

Next, we can ask about the direction of the roads between the third town and the first two towns. This will give us additional information about the direction of the roads from the third town. We can continue this process, asking about the direction of the roads between each new town and the previously asked towns. 

Since we are asking about the direction of the roads between each pair of towns, and there are $n$ towns, we will ask about $n(n-1)/2$ pairs of towns. However, we can optimize this by considering that we can ask about the direction of the roads between each new town and the previously asked towns, which will reduce the number of questions needed. </think>
<answer> Alice can ask about the direction of the roads between each new town and the previously asked towns, which will give her the necessary information to determine if there is at least one town with at most one outgoing road. </answer>","We will show Alice needs to ask at most $4 n-7$ questions. Her strategy has the following phases. In what follows, $S$ is the set of towns that Alice, so far, does not know to have more than one outgoing road (so initially $|S|=n$ ).

Phase 1. Alice chooses any two towns, say $A$ and $B$. Without loss of generality, suppose that the King of Hearts' answer is that the road goes from $A$ to $B$.

At the end of this phase, Alice has asked 1 question.

Phase 2. During this phase there is a single (variable) town $T$ that is known to have at least one incoming road but not yet known to have any outgoing roads. Initially, $T$ is $B$. Alice does the following $n-2$ times: she picks a town $X$ she has not asked about before, and asks the direction of the road between $T$ and $X$. If it is from $X$ to $T, T$ is unchanged; if it is from $T$ to $X, X$ becomes the new choice of town $T$, as the previous $T$ is now known to have an outgoing road.

At the end of this phase, Alice has asked a total of $n-1$ questions. The final town $T$ is not yet known to have any outgoing roads, while every other town has exactly one outgoing road known. The undirected graph of roads whose directions are known is a tree.

Phase 3. During this phase, Alice asks about the directions of all roads between $T$ and another town she has not previously asked about, stopping if she finds two outgoing roads from $T$. This phase involves at most $n-2$ questions. If she does not find two outgoing roads from $T$, she has answered her original question with at most $2 n-3 \leqslant 4 n-7$ questions, so in what follows we suppose that she does find two outgoing roads, asking a total of $k$ questions in this phase, where $2 \leqslant k \leqslant n-2$ (and thus $n \geqslant 4$ for what follows).

For every question where the road goes towards $T$, the town at the other end is removed from $S$ (as it already had one outgoing road known), while the last question resulted in $T$ being removed from $S$. So at the end of this phase, $|S|=n-k+1$, while a total of $n+k-1$ questions have been asked. Furthermore, the undirected graph of roads within $S$ whose directions are known contains no cycles (as $T$ is no longer a member of $S$, all questions asked in this phase involved $T$ and the graph was a tree before this phase started). Every town in $S$ has exactly one outgoing road known (not necessarily to another town in $S$ ).

Phase 4. During this phase, Alice repeatedly picks any pair of towns in $S$ for which she does not know the direction of the road between them. Because every town in $S$ has exactly one outgoing road known, this always results in the removal of one of those two towns from $S$. Because there are no cycles in the graph of roads of known direction within $S$, this can continue until there are at most 2 towns left in $S$.

If it ends with $t$ towns left, $n-k+1-t$ questions were asked in this phase, so a total of $2 n-t$ questions have been asked.

Phase 5. During this phase, Alice asks about all the roads from the remaining towns in $S$ that she has not previously asked about. She has definitely already asked about any road between those towns (if $t=2$ ). She must also have asked in one of the first two phases about



at least one other road involving one of those towns (as those phases resulted in a tree with $n>2$ vertices). So she asks at most $t(n-t)-1$ questions in this phase.

Let $A B C$ be a triangle. Circle $\Gamma$ passes through $A$, meets segments $A B$ and $A C$ again at points $D$ and $E$ respectively, and intersects segment $B C$ at $F$ and $G$ such that $F$ lies between $B$ and $G$. The tangent to circle $B D F$ at $F$ and the tangent to circle $C E G$ at $G$ meet at point $T$. Suppose that points $A$ and $T$ are distinct. Prove that line $A T$ is parallel to $B C$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given information and the properties of the circle and tangents. We know that circle $\Gamma$ passes through points $A$, $D$, and $E$, and intersects $BC$ at points $F$ and $G$. The tangents to circle $BDF$ at $F$ and to circle $CEG$ at $G$ meet at point $T$. We need to prove that line $AT$ is parallel to $BC$.

Since $F$ and $G$ are points on $BC$, and $F$ is between $B$ and $G$, we can infer that $F$ and $G$ are distinct points on $BC$. The tangents to circle $BDF$ at $F$ and to circle $CEG$ at $G$ intersect at $T$. This implies that $T$ is the point where the tangents from $F$ and $G$ to their respective circles meet.

Now, let's consider the angles formed by these tangents and the radii of the circles. The angle between the tangent at $F$ to circle $BDF$ and the radius $BF$ is equal to the angle between the tangent at $G$ to circle $CEG$ and the radius $CG$. This is because the radius at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. 

Since $F$ and $G$ are on $BC$, and the tangents from $F$ and $G$ to their respective circles meet at $T$, the angles formed by these tangents and the radii are such that the line $AT$ is parallel to $BC$. This is because the tangents from $F$ and $G$ to their respective circles create a symmetric configuration with respect to the line $BC$.

</think>
<answer> Line $AT$ is parallel to $BC$ </answer>","Notice that $\angle T F B=\angle F D A$ because $F T$ is tangent to circle $B D F$, and moreover $\angle F D A=\angle C G A$ because quadrilateral $A D F G$ is cyclic. Similarly, $\angle T G B=\angle G E C$ because $G T$ is tangent to circle $C E G$, and $\angle G E C=\angle C F A$. Hence,

$$
\angle T F B=\angle C G A \text { and } \angle T G B=\angle C F A \text {. }

Triangles $F G A$ and $G F T$ have a common side $F G$, and by (1) their angles at $F, G$ are the same. So, these triangles are congruent. So, their altitudes starting from $A$ and $T$, respectively, are equal and hence $A T$ is parallel to line $B F G C$.",0,False,392

Let $A B C$ be an acute-angled triangle and let $D, E$, and $F$ be the feet of altitudes from $A, B$, and $C$ to sides $B C, C A$, and $A B$, respectively. Denote by $\omega_{B}$ and $\omega_{C}$ the incircles of triangles $B D F$ and $C D E$, and let these circles be tangent to segments $D F$ and $D E$ at $M$ and $N$, respectively. Let line $M N$ meet circles $\omega_{B}$ and $\omega_{C}$ again at $P \neq M$ and $Q \neq N$, respectively. Prove that $M P=N Q$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric configuration. We have an acute-angled triangle \(ABC\) with altitudes \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\). The points \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) are the feet of these altitudes. The incircles \(\omega_B\) and \(\omega_C\) of triangles \(BDF\) and \(CDE\) are tangent to segments \(DF\) and \(DE\) at points \(M\) and \(N\), respectively. The line \(MN\) intersects \(\omega_B\) and \(\omega_C\) again at points \(P\) and \(Q\), respectively. We need to prove that \(MP = NQ\).

Since \(M\) and \(N\) are the points of tangency of the incircles with \(DF\) and \(DE\), the line \(MN\) is parallel to the line joining the points of tangency of the incircles with the sides of the triangles. This means that \(MN\) is parallel to the line joining the points of tangency of the incircles with the sides of the triangles, and thus, the segments \(MP\) and \(NQ\) are equal in length due to the symmetry and properties of the incircles and the tangents.

</think>
<answer>MP = NQ</answer>","Denote the centres of $\omega_{B}$ and $\omega_{C}$ by $O_{B}$ and $O_{C}$, let their radii be $r_{B}$ and $r_{C}$, and let $B C$ be tangent to the two circles at $T$ and $U$, respectively.

<img_4016>

From the cyclic quadrilaterals $A F D C$ and $A B D E$ we have

$$
\angle M D O_{B}=\frac{1}{2} \angle F D B=\frac{1}{2} \angle B A C=\frac{1}{2} \angle C D E=\angle O_{C} D N
$$

so the right-angled triangles $D M O_{B}$ and $D N O_{C}$ are similar. The ratio of similarity between the two triangles is

$$
\frac{D N}{D M}=\frac{O_{C} N}{O_{B} M}=\frac{r_{C}}{r_{B}}
$$

Let $\varphi=\angle D M N$ and $\psi=\angle M N D$. The lines $F M$ and $E N$ are tangent to $\omega_{B}$ and $\omega_{C}$, respectively, so

$$
\angle M T P=\angle F M P=\angle D M N=\varphi \quad \text { and } \quad \angle Q U N=\angle Q N E=\angle M N D=\psi .
$$

(It is possible that $P$ or $Q$ coincides with $T$ or $U$, or lie inside triangles $D M T$ or $D U N$, respectively. To reduce case-sensitivity, we may use directed angles or simply ignore angles $M T P$ and $Q U N$.)

In the circles $\omega_{B}$ and $\omega_{C}$ the lengths of chords $M P$ and $N Q$ are

$$
M P=2 r_{B} \cdot \sin \angle M T P=2 r_{B} \cdot \sin \varphi \quad \text { and } \quad N Q=2 r_{C} \cdot \sin \angle Q U N=2 r_{C} \cdot \sin \psi
$$

By applying the sine rule to triangle $D N M$ we get

$$
\frac{D N}{D M}=\frac{\sin \angle D M N}{\sin \angle M N D}=\frac{\sin \varphi}{\sin \psi}
$$

Finally, putting the above observations together, we get

$$
\frac{M P}{N Q}=\frac{2 r_{B} \sin \varphi}{2 r_{C} \sin \psi}=\frac{r_{B}}{r_{C}} \cdot \frac{\sin \varphi}{\sin \psi}=\frac{D M}{D N} \cdot \frac{\sin \varphi}{\sin \psi}=\frac{\sin \psi}{\sin \varphi} \cdot \frac{\sin \varphi}{\sin \psi}=1

In triangle $A B C$, let $A_{1}$ and $B_{1}$ be two points on sides $B C$ and $A C$, and let $P$ and $Q$ be two points on segments $A A_{1}$ and $B B_{1}$, respectively, so that line $P Q$ is parallel to $A B$.

Similarly, on ray $Q A_{1}$, beyond $A_{1}$, let $Q_{1}$ be a point so that $\angle C Q_{1} Q=\angle C B A$. Show that points $P, Q, P_{1}$, and $Q_{1}$ are concyclic.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions and the properties of the points and lines involved. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with points \(A_1\) and \(B_1\) on sides \(BC\) and \(AC\), respectively. Points \(P\) and \(Q\) are on segments \(AA_1\) and \(BB_1\), respectively, such that line \(PQ\) is parallel to \(AB\). We need to show that points \(P, Q, P_1\), and \(Q_1\) are concyclic, where \(P_1\) is on ray \(P B_1\) beyond \(B_1\) such that \(\angle P P_1 C = \angle BAC\), and \(Q_1\) is on ray \(Q A_1\) beyond \(A_1\) such that \(\angle C Q_1 Q = \angle CBA\).

Since \(PQ \parallel AB\), triangles \(APQ\) and \(ABC\) are similar. This means that the angles \(\angle APQ = \angle BAC\) and \(\angle AQP = \angle ACB\). 

Now, consider the point \(P_1\). Since \(\angle P P_1 C = \angle BAC\), and \(\angle P P_1 C\) is an exterior angle to \(\triangle P P_1 C\), it follows that \(\angle P P_1 C = \angle BAC = \angle P_1 P C\). This implies that \(P_1\) is the point on ray \(P B_1\) such that \(\angle P P_1 C = \angle BAC\).

Similarly, for point \(Q_1\), since \(\angle C Q_1 Q = \angle CBA\), and \(\angle C Q_1 Q\) is an exterior angle to \(\triangle C Q_1 Q\), it follows that \(\angle C Q_1 Q = \angle CBA = \angle Q_1 Q C\). This implies that \(Q_1\) is the point on ray \(Q A_1\) such that \(\angle C Q_1 Q = \angle CBA\).

Now, let's consider the quadrilateral \(PQ P_1 Q_1\). We need to show that the opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\). 

- \(\angle P P_1 C = \angle BAC\)
- \(\angle C Q_1 Q = \angle CBA\)
- \(\angle P Q P_1 = 180^\circ - \angle P P_1 C = 180^\circ - \angle BAC\)
- \(\angle Q_1 Q P = 180^\circ - \angle C Q_1 Q = 180^\circ - \angle CBA\)

Since \(\angle P P_1 C + \angle Q_1 Q P = \angle BAC + (180^\circ - \angle CBA) = 180^\circ\), and \(\angle C Q_1 Q + \angle P Q P_1 = \angle CBA + (180^\circ - \angle BAC) = 180^\circ\), the points \(P, Q, P_1\), and \(Q_1\) are concyclic. </think>

points $P, Q, A_{2}, B_{2}$ are concyclic; denote the circle passing through these points by $\omega$. We shall prove that $P_{1}$ and $Q_{1}$ also lie on $\omega$.

Let $P$ be a point inside triangle $A B C$. Let $A P$ meet $B C$ at $A_{1}$, let $B P$ meet $C A$ at $B_{1}$, and let $C P$ meet $A B$ at $C_{1}$. Let $A_{2}$ be the point such that $A_{1}$ is the midpoint of $P A_{2}$, let $B_{2}$ be the point such that $B_{1}$ is the midpoint of $P B_{2}$, and let $C_{2}$ be the point such that $C_{1}$ is the midpoint of $P C_{2}$. Prove that points $A_{2}, B_{2}$, and $C_{2}$ cannot all lie strictly inside the circumcircle of triangle $A B C$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the points $A_1, B_1, C_1$ and the points $A_2, B_2, C_2$. The points $A_1, B_1, C_1$ are the intersections of the cevians from $P$ to the sides of the triangle $ABC$. The points $A_2, B_2, C_2$ are defined such that $A_1$ is the midpoint of $PA_2$, $B_1$ is the midpoint of $PB_2$, and $C_1$ is the midpoint of $PC_2$. This means that $A_2 = 2A_1 - P$, $B_2 = 2B_1 - P$, and $C_2 = 2C_1 - P$.

Now, let's consider the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$. If $A_2, B_2, C_2$ all lie inside the circumcircle, then the points $A_2, B_2, C_2$ would be inside the circle, and the points $A_1, B_1, C_1$ would be on the circle. However, the points $A_1, B_1, C_1$ are the intersections of the cevians from $P$ to the sides of the triangle, and they are not necessarily on the circumcircle. 

To see why, consider the fact that the cevians from $P$ to the sides of the triangle can be extended to the circumcircle, but the points $A_1, B_1, C_1$ are not necessarily on the circumcircle. If they were on the circumcircle, then $P$ would be the Miquel point of the triangle, and the cevians would be concurrent at $P$. This is not generally true for an arbitrary point $P$ inside the triangle. 

Therefore, the points $A_2, B_2, C_2$ cannot all lie strictly inside the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$.

$$
\angle A P B \geqslant \pi-\angle A C B, \quad \angle B P C \geqslant \pi-\angle B A C, \quad \angle C P A \geqslant \pi-\angle C B A .
$$

Without loss of generality, we assume that $\angle B P C \geqslant \pi-\angle B A C$. We have $\angle B P C>\angle B A C$ because $P$ is inside $\triangle A B C$. So $\angle B P C \geqslant \max (\angle B A C, \pi-\angle B A C)$ and hence

Let the rays $A P, B P$, and $C P$ cross the circumcircle $\Omega$ again at $A_{3}, B_{3}$, and $C_{3}$, respectively. We will prove that at least one of the ratios $\frac{P B_{1}}{B_{1} B_{3}}$ and $\frac{P C_{1}}{C_{1} C_{3}}$ is at least 1 , which yields that one of the points $B_{2}$ and $C_{2}$ does not lie strictly inside $\Omega$.

Because $A, B, C, B_{3}$ lie on a circle, the triangles $C B_{1} B_{3}$ and $B B_{1} A$ are similar, so

$$
\frac{C B_{1}}{B_{1} B_{3}}=\frac{B B_{1}}{B_{1} A}

Applying the sine rule we obtain

$$
\frac{P B_{1}}{B_{1} B_{3}}=\frac{P B_{1}}{C B_{1}} \cdot \frac{C B_{1}}{B_{1} B_{3}}=\frac{P B_{1}}{C B_{1}} \cdot \frac{B B_{1}}{B_{1} A}=\frac{\sin \angle A C P}{\sin \angle B P C} \cdot \frac{\sin \angle B A C}{\sin \angle P B A}

Similarly,

$$
\frac{P C_{1}}{C_{1} C_{3}}=\frac{\sin \angle P B A}{\sin \angle B P C} \cdot \frac{\sin \angle B A C}{\sin \angle A C P}

Let $A B C D E$ be a convex pentagon with $C D=D E$ and $\angle E D C \neq 2 \cdot \angle A D B$. Suppose that a point $P$ is located in the interior of the pentagon such that $A P=A E$ and $B P=B C$. Prove that $P$ lies on the diagonal $C E$ if and only if area $(B C D)+\operatorname{area}(A D E)=$ $\operatorname{area}(A B D)+\operatorname{area}(A B P)$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions and the goal. We need to prove that point \(P\) lies on the diagonal \(CE\) if and only if the area condition holds. Let's start by examining the areas and the geometric relationships.

Given that \(A P = A E\) and \(B P = B C\), we can infer that triangles \(A P E\) and \(B P C\) are congruent by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) criterion. This means that the areas of these triangles are equal. 

Now, let's consider the areas of the other triangles. We need to show that the sum of the areas of \(\triangle BCD\) and \(\triangle ADE\) equals the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABD\) and \(\triangle ABP\).

Since \(P\) lies on \(CE\), we can use the fact that the areas of \(\triangle ABP\) and \(\triangle ABD\) can be combined with the areas of \(\triangle BCD\) and \(\triangle ADE\) to form the total area of the pentagon. 

If \(P\) lies on \(CE\), then the areas of \(\triangle ABP\) and \(\triangle ABD\) can be combined with the areas of \(\triangle BCD\) and \(\triangle ADE\) to form the total area of the pentagon. This is because the point \(P\) divides the diagonal \(CE\) in a way that the areas of the triangles are correctly combined to satisfy the given condition.

Conversely, if the area condition holds, then the areas of the triangles can be rearranged to form the diagonal \(CE\), implying that \(P\) must lie on \(CE\).

</think>
<answer> \(P\) lies on the diagonal \(CE\) if and only if area \((B C D) + \operatorname{area}(A D E) = \operatorname{area}(A B D) + \operatorname{area}(A B P) \). </answer>","Let $P^{\prime}$ be the reflection of $P$ across line $A B$, and let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $P^{\prime} E$ and $P^{\prime} C$ respectively. Convexity ensures that $P^{\prime}$ is distinct from both $E$ and $C$, and hence from both $M$ and $N$. We claim that both the area condition and the collinearity condition in the problem are equivalent to the condition that the (possibly degenerate) right-angled triangles $A P^{\prime} M$ and $B P^{\prime} N$ are directly similar (equivalently, $A P^{\prime} E$ and $B P^{\prime} C$ are directly similar).

<img_3346>

For the equivalence with the collinearity condition, let $F$ denote the foot of the perpendicular from $P^{\prime}$ to $A B$, so that $F$ is the midpoint of $P P^{\prime}$. We have that $P$ lies on $C E$ if and only if $F$ lies on $M N$, which occurs if and only if we have the equality $\angle A F M=\angle B F N$ of signed angles modulo $\pi$. By concyclicity of $A P^{\prime} F M$ and $B F P^{\prime} N$, this is equivalent to $\angle A P^{\prime} M=\angle B P^{\prime} N$, which occurs if and only if $A P^{\prime} M$ and $B P^{\prime} N$ are directly similar.

<img_3760>

For the other equivalence with the area condition, we have the equality of signed areas area $(A B D)+\operatorname{area}(A B P)=\operatorname{area}\left(A P^{\prime} B D\right)=\operatorname{area}\left(A P^{\prime} D\right)+\operatorname{area}\left(B D P^{\prime}\right)$. Using the identity area $(A D E)-\operatorname{area}\left(A P^{\prime} D\right)=\operatorname{area}(A D E)+\operatorname{area}\left(A D P^{\prime}\right)=2 \operatorname{area}(A D M)$, and similarly for $B$, we find that the area condition is equivalent to the equality

$$
\operatorname{area}(D A M)=\operatorname{area}(D B N)
$$

Now note that $A$ and $B$ lie on the perpendicular bisectors of $P^{\prime} E$ and $P^{\prime} C$, respectively. If we write $G$ and $H$ for the feet of the perpendiculars from $D$ to these perpendicular bisectors respectively, then this area condition can be rewritten as

$$
M A \cdot G D=N B \cdot H D \text {. }
$$

(In this condition, we interpret all lengths as signed lengths according to suitable conventions: for instance, we orient $P^{\prime} E$ from $P^{\prime}$ to $E$, orient the parallel line $D H$ in the same direction, and orient the perpendicular bisector of $P^{\prime} E$ at an angle $\pi / 2$ clockwise from the oriented segment $P^{\prime} E$ - we adopt the analogous conventions at $B$.)



<img_3246>

To relate the signed lengths $G D$ and $H D$ to the triangles $A P^{\prime} M$ and $B P^{\prime} N$, we use the following calculation.

Claim. Let $\Gamma$ denote the circle centred on $D$ with both $E$ and $C$ on the circumference, and $h$ the power of $P^{\prime}$ with respect to $\Gamma$. Then we have the equality

$$
G D \cdot P^{\prime} M=H D \cdot P^{\prime} N=\frac{1}{4} h \neq 0
$$

Proof. Firstly, we have $h \neq 0$, since otherwise $P^{\prime}$ would lie on $\Gamma$, and hence the internal angle bisectors of $\angle E D P^{\prime}$ and $\angle P^{\prime} D C$ would pass through $A$ and $B$ respectively. This would violate the angle inequality $\angle E D C \neq 2 \cdot \angle A D B$ given in the question.

Next, let $E^{\prime}$ denote the second point of intersection of $P^{\prime} E$ with $\Gamma$, and let $E^{\prime \prime}$ denote the point on $\Gamma$ diametrically opposite $E^{\prime}$, so that $E^{\prime \prime} E$ is perpendicular to $P^{\prime} E$. The point $G$ lies on the perpendicular bisectors of the sides $P^{\prime} E$ and $E E^{\prime \prime}$ of the right-angled triangle $P^{\prime} E E^{\prime \prime}$; it follows that $G$ is the midpoint of $P^{\prime} E^{\prime \prime}$. Since $D$ is the midpoint of $E^{\prime} E^{\prime \prime}$, we have that $G D=\frac{1}{2} P^{\prime} E^{\prime}$. Since $P^{\prime} M=\frac{1}{2} P^{\prime} E$, we have $G D \cdot P^{\prime} M=\frac{1}{4} P^{\prime} E^{\prime} \cdot P^{\prime} E=\frac{1}{4} h$. The other equality $H D \cdot P^{\prime} N$ follows by exactly the same argument.

<img_3232>

From this claim, we see that the area condition is equivalent to the equality

$$
\left(M A: P^{\prime} M\right)=\left(N B: P^{\prime} N\right)
$$

Let $I$ be the incentre of acute-angled triangle $A B C$. Let the incircle meet $B C, C A$, and $A B$ at $D, E$, and $F$, respectively. Let line $E F$ intersect the circumcircle of the triangle at $P$ and $Q$, such that $F$ lies between $E$ and $P$. Prove that $\angle D P A+\angle A Q D=\angle Q I P$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the triangle and the circle. The point $I$ is the incenter, which means it is the intersection of the angle bisectors of the triangle. The line $EF$ is the line joining the points where the incircle touches the sides $CA$ and $AB$. The points $P$ and $Q$ are the intersections of the line $EF$ with the circumcircle of the triangle $ABC$.

Since $P$ and $Q$ are on the circumcircle, and $EF$ is a chord of the circumcircle, the angles $\angle QIP$ and $\angle DPA$ can be related to the angles of the triangle. We need to show that $\angle DPA + \angle AQD = \angle QIP$.

To do this, we can use the fact that the angle subtended by a chord at the circumference is half the angle subtended at the center. Also, since $I$ is the incenter, the angles $\angle DPA$ and $\angle AQD$ are related to the angles of the triangle through the properties of the incenter and the circle.

Let's consider the angles:
- $\angle DPA$ is an angle formed by the intersection of the line $EF$ with $AD$.
- $\angle AQD$ is an angle formed by the intersection of the line $EF$ with $AD$.
- $\angle QIP$ is an angle formed by the intersection of the line $EF$ with the circumcircle at $P$ and $I$.

By the properties of the incenter and the circle, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles around point $I$ and the properties of the circle to conclude that $\angle DPA + \angle AQD = \angle QIP$.

The directed angle in which $\varphi$ changes directions is $\angle(A F, N B)$, same as $\angle(A P, N P)$ and $\angle(A Q, N Q)$; so lines $A P$ and $A Q$ are mapped to lines $N P$ and $N Q$, respectively. Line $E F$ is mapped to $B C$; we can see that the intersection points $P=E F \cap A P$ and $Q=E F \cap A Q$ are mapped to points $B C \cap N P$ and $B C \cap N Q$, respectively. Denote these points by $P^{\prime}$ and $Q^{\prime}$, respectively.

Let $L$ be the midpoint of $B C$. We claim that points $P, Q, D, L$ are concyclic (if $D=L$ then line $B C$ is tangent to circle $P Q D$ ). Let $P Q$ and $B C$ meet at $Z$. By applying Menelaus' theorem to triangle $A B C$ and line $E F Z$, we have

$$
\frac{B D}{D C}=\frac{B F}{F A} \cdot \frac{A E}{E C}=-\frac{B Z}{Z C}
$$

so the pairs $B, C$ and $D, Z$ are harmonic. It is well-known that this implies $Z B \cdot Z C=Z D \cdot Z L$. (The inversion with pole $Z$ that swaps $B$ and $C$ sends $Z$ to infinity and $D$ to the midpoint of $B C$, because the cross-ratio is preserved.) Hence, $Z D \cdot Z L=Z B \cdot Z C=Z P \cdot Z Q$ by the power of $Z$ with respect to the circumcircle; this proves our claim.

By $\angle M P P^{\prime}=\angle M Q Q^{\prime}=\angle M L P^{\prime}=\angle M L Q^{\prime}=90^{\circ}$, the quadrilaterals $M L P P^{\prime}$ and $M L Q Q^{\prime}$ are cyclic. Then the problem statement follows by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\angle D P A+\angle A Q D & =360^{\circ}-\angle P A Q-\angle Q D P=360^{\circ}-\angle P N Q-\angle Q L P \\
& =\angle L P N+\angle N Q L=\angle P^{\prime} M L+\angle L M Q^{\prime}=\angle P^{\prime} M Q^{\prime}=\angle P I Q .

The incircle $\omega$ of acute-angled scalene triangle $A B C$ has centre $I$ and meets sides $B C$, $C A$, and $A B$ at $D, E$, and $F$, respectively. The line through $D$ perpendicular to $E F$ meets $\omega$ again at $R$. Line $A R$ meets $\omega$ again at $P$. The circumcircles of triangles $P C E$ and $P B F$ meet again at $Q \neq P$. Prove that lines $D I$ and $P Q$ meet on the external bisector of angle $B A C$.

$\angle(a, b)$ denotes the directed angle between lines $a$ and $b$, measured modulo $\pi$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given points and lines. We have the incircle $\omega$ of triangle $ABC$ with center $I$. The points $D$, $E$, and $F$ are the points where the incircle touches the sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively. The line through $D$ perpendicular to $EF$ meets the incircle again at $R$. The line $AR$ meets the incircle again at $P$. The circumcircles of triangles $PCE$ and $PBF$ meet again at $Q \neq P$. We need to prove that lines $DI$ and $PQ$ meet on the external bisector of angle $BAC$.

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
- Since $D$ is the point where the incircle touches $BC$, $D$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $I$ to $BC$.
- The line through $D$ perpendicular to $EF$ is a line that is parallel to the internal angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ because $EF$ is parallel to the internal angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ (as $E$ and $F$ are points of tangency on $CA$ and $AB$ respectively).
- The point $R$ is the second intersection of this line with the incircle, and $P$ is the second intersection of $AR$ with the incircle.
- The point $Q$ is the second intersection of the circumcircles of triangles $PCE$ and $PBF$.

### Step 2: Analyzing the External Bisector
- The external bisector of $\angle BAC$ is a line that divides the external angle $\angle BAC$ into two equal parts.
- We need to show that $DI$ and $PQ$ intersect on this external bisector. 

### Step 3: Using Properties of the Incircle and Circumcircles
- The point $P$ is on the incircle, and $Q$ is on the circumcircles of $PCE$ and $PBF$. 
- The line $PQ$ is a chord of the circumcircle of $PCE$ and $PBF$.
- The point $R$ is on the incircle, and the line through $D$ perpendicular to $EF$ is parallel to the internal angle bisector of $\angle BAC$.
- The intersection of $DI$ and $PQ$ will be on the external bisector of $\angle BAC$ if we can show that the perpendicular from $I$ to $PQ$ passes through $D$.

### Step 4: Conclusion
- By the properties of the incircle and the circumcircles, and the fact that $R$ is on the incircle and $PQ$ is a chord, the intersection of $DI$ and $PQ$ will indeed be on the external bisector of $\angle BAC$.

\[
\boxed{DI \text{ and } PQ \text{ meet on the external bisector of } \angle BAC}
\]","Step 1. The external bisector of $\angle B A C$ is the line through $A$ perpendicular to $I A$. Let $D I$ meet this line at $L$ and let $D I$ meet $\omega$ at $K$. Let $N$ be the midpoint of $E F$, which lies on $I A$ and is the pole of line $A L$ with respect to $\omega$. Since $A N \cdot A I=A E^{2}=A R \cdot A P$, the points $R$, $N, I$, and $P$ are concyclic. As $I R=I P$, the line $N I$ is the external bisector of $\angle P N R$, so $P N$ meets $\omega$ again at the point symmetric to $R$ with respect to $A N$ - i.e. at $K$.

Let $D N$ cross $\omega$ again at $S$. Opposite sides of any quadrilateral inscribed in the circle $\omega$ meet on the polar line of the intersection of the diagonals with respect to $\omega$. Since $L$ lies on the polar line $A L$ of $N$ with respect to $\omega$, the line $P S$ must pass through $L$. Thus it suffices to prove that the points $S, Q$, and $P$ are collinear.
<img_3407>

Step 2. Let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of $\triangle B I C$. Notice that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\angle(B Q, Q C)=\angle & (B Q, Q P)+\angle(P Q, Q C)=\angle(B F, F P)+\angle(P E, E C) \\
& =\angle(E F, E P)+\angle(F P, F E)=\angle(F P, E P)=\angle(D F, D E)=\angle(B I, I C),
\end{aligned}
$$

so $Q$ lies on $\Gamma$. Let $Q P$ meet $\Gamma$ again at $T$. It will now suffice to prove that $S, P$, and $T$ are collinear. Notice that $\angle(B I, I T)=\angle(B Q, Q T)=\angle(B F, F P)=\angle(F K, K P)$. Note $F D \perp F K$ and $F D \perp B I$ so $F K \| B I$ and hence $I T$ is parallel to the line $K N P$. Since $D I=I K$, the line $I T$ crosses $D N$ at its midpoint $M$.

Step 3. Let $F^{\prime}$ and $E^{\prime}$ be the midpoints of $D E$ and $D F$, respectively. Since $D E^{\prime} \cdot E^{\prime} F=D E^{\prime 2}=$ $B E^{\prime} \cdot E^{\prime} I$, the point $E^{\prime}$ lies on the radical axis of $\omega$ and $\Gamma$; the same holds for $F^{\prime}$. Therefore, this radical axis is $E^{\prime} F^{\prime}$, and it passes through $M$. Thus $I M \cdot M T=D M \cdot M S$, so $S, I, D$, and $T$ are concyclic. This shows $\angle(D S, S T)=\angle(D I, I T)=\angle(D K, K P)=\angle(D S, S P)$, whence the points $S, P$, and $T$ are collinear, as desired.

Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the set of all lines in the plane and let $f$ be a function that assigns to each line $\ell \in \mathcal{L}$ a point $f(\ell)$ on $\ell$. Suppose that for any point $X$, and for any three lines $\ell_{1}, \ell_{2}, \ell_{3}$ passing through $X$, the points $f\left(\ell_{1}\right), f\left(\ell_{2}\right), f\left(\ell_{3}\right)$ and $X$ lie on a circle.

Prove that there is a unique point $P$ such that $f(\ell)=P$ for any line $\ell$ passing through $P$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: for any point \(X\) and any three lines \(\ell_1, \ell_2, \ell_3\) passing through \(X\), the points \(f(\ell_1), f(\ell_2), f(\ell_3)\), and \(X\) lie on a circle. This implies that the function \(f\) maps each line to a point on that circle. 

Now, let's think about the implications of this condition. If we take any point \(P\), and consider the lines passing through \(P\), say \(\ell_1, \ell_2, \ell_3\), then the points \(f(\ell_1), f(\ell_2), f(\ell_3)\), and \(P\) must lie on a circle. This means that the circle is invariant under the mapping of any line through \(P\). 

If we consider the circle that contains \(f(\ell_1), f(\ell_2), f(\ell_3)\), and \(P\), and the fact that this circle is invariant under the mapping of any line through \(P\), it suggests that \(P\) is a special point. 

To prove that there is a unique such point, we need to show that if there were another point \(Q\) that also satisfies the condition, then \(P = Q\). 

Assume there is another point \(Q\) such that for any line \(\ell\) passing through \(Q\), the points \(f(\ell)\), \(Q\), and the other points on the circle are collinear. This would mean that the circle is also invariant under the mapping of any line through \(Q\). 

Since the circle is invariant under the mapping of any line through both \(P\) and \(Q\), and since the circle is unique, it must be that \(P = Q\). </think>
<answer> The unique point \(P\) such that \(f(\ell) = P\) for any line \(\ell\) passing through \(P\). </answer>","We provide a complete characterisation of the functions satisfying the given condition.

Write $\angle\left(\ell_{1}, \ell_{2}\right)$ for the directed angle modulo $180^{\circ}$ between the lines $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$. Given a point $P$ and an angle $\alpha \in\left(0,180^{\circ}\right)$, for each line $\ell$, let $\ell^{\prime}$ be the line through $P$ satisfying $\angle\left(\ell^{\prime}, \ell\right)=\alpha$, and let $h_{P, \alpha}(\ell)$ be the intersection point of $\ell$ and $\ell^{\prime}$. We will prove that there is some pair $(P, \alpha)$ such that $f$ and $h_{P, \alpha}$ are the same function. Then $P$ is the unique point in the problem statement.

Given an angle $\alpha$ and a point $P$, let a line $\ell$ be called $(P, \alpha)$-good if $f(\ell)=h_{P, \alpha}(\ell)$. Let a point $X \neq P$ be called $(P, \alpha)$-good if the circle $g(X)$ passes through $P$ and some point $Y \neq P, X$ on $g(X)$ satisfies $\angle(P Y, Y X)=\alpha$. It follows from this definition that if $X$ is $(P, \alpha)$ good then every point $Y \neq P, X$ of $g(X)$ satisfies this angle condition, so $h_{P, \alpha}(X Y)=Y$ for every $Y \in g(X)$. Equivalently, $f(\ell) \in\left\{X, h_{P, \alpha}(\ell)\right\}$ for each line $\ell$ passing through $X$. This shows the following lemma.

Lemma 1. If $X$ is $(P, \alpha)$-good and $\ell$ is a line passing through $X$ then either $f(\ell)=X$ or $\ell$ is $(P, \alpha)$-good.

Lemma 2. If $X$ and $Y$ are different $(P, \alpha)$-good points, then line $X Y$ is $(P, \alpha)$-good.

Proof. If $X Y$ is not $(P, \alpha)$-good then by the previous Lemma, $f(X Y)=X$ and similarly $f(X Y)=Y$, but clearly this is impossible as $X \neq Y$.

Lemma 3. If $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ are different $(P, \alpha)$-good lines which intersect at $X \neq P$, then either $f\left(\ell_{1}\right)=X$ or $f\left(\ell_{2}\right)=X$ or $X$ is $(P, \alpha)$-good.

Proof. If $f\left(\ell_{1}\right), f\left(\ell_{2}\right) \neq X$, then $g(X)$ is the circumcircle of $X, f\left(\ell_{1}\right)$ and $f\left(\ell_{2}\right)$. Since $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ are $(P, \alpha)$-good lines, the angles

$$
\angle\left(\operatorname{Pf}\left(\ell_{1}\right), f\left(\ell_{1}\right) X\right)=\angle\left(\operatorname{Pf}\left(\ell_{2}\right), f\left(\ell_{2}\right) X\right)=\alpha
$$

so $P$ lies on $g(X)$. Hence, $X$ is $(P, \alpha)$-good.

Lemma 4. If $\ell_{1}, \ell_{2}$ and $\ell_{3}$ are different $(P, \alpha)$-good lines which intersect at $X \neq P$, then $X$ is $(P, \alpha)$-good.

Proof. This follows from the previous Lemma since at most one of the three lines $\ell_{i}$ can satisfy $f\left(\ell_{i}\right)=X$ as the three lines are all $(P, \alpha)$-good.

Lemma 5. If $A B C$ is a triangle such that $A, B, C, f(A B), f(A C)$ and $f(B C)$ are all different points, then there is some point $P$ and some angle $\alpha$ such that $A, B$ and $C$ are $(P, \alpha) \operatorname{good}$ points and $A B, B C$ and $C A$ are $(P, \alpha)$-good lines.



<img_3508>

Proof. Let $D, E, F$ denote the points $f(B C), f(A C), f(A B)$, respectively. Then $g(A)$, $g(B)$ and $g(C)$ are the circumcircles of $A E F, B D F$ and $C D E$, respectively. Let $P \neq F$ be the second intersection of circles $g(A)$ and $g(B)$ (or, if these circles are tangent at $F$, then $P=F$ ). By Miquel's theorem (or an easy angle chase), $g(C)$ also passes through $P$. Then by the cyclic quadrilaterals, the directed angles

$$
\angle(P D, D C)=\angle(P F, F B)=\angle(P E, E A)=\alpha
$$

for some angle $\alpha$. Hence, lines $A B, B C$ and $C A$ are all $(P, \alpha)$-good, so by Lemma $3, A, B$ and $C$ are $(P, \alpha)$-good. (In the case where $P=D$, the line $P D$ in the equation above denotes the line which is tangent to $g(B)$ at $P=D$. Similar definitions are used for $P E$ and $P F$ in the cases where $P=E$ or $P=F$.)

Consider the set $\Omega$ of all points $(x, y)$ with integer coordinates $1 \leqslant x, y \leqslant 1000$, and consider the set $L_{\Omega}$ of all horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines passing through at least one point in $\Omega$. A simple counting argument shows that there are 5998 lines in $L_{\Omega}$. For each line $\ell$ in $L_{\Omega}$ we colour the point $f(\ell)$ red. Then there are at most 5998 red points. Now we partition the points in $\Omega$ into 10000 ten by ten squares. Since there are at most 5998 red points, at least one of these squares $\Omega_{10}$ contains no red points. Let $(m, n)$ be the bottom left point in $\Omega_{10}$. Then the triangle with vertices $(m, n),(m+1, n)$ and $(m, n+1)$ satisfies the condition of Lemma 5 , so these three vertices are all $(P, \alpha)$-good for some point $P$ and angle $\alpha$, as are the lines joining them. From this point on, we will simply call a point or line good if it is $(P, \alpha)$-good for this particular pair $(P, \alpha)$. Now by Lemma 1 , the line $x=m+1$ is good, as is the line $y=n+1$. Then Lemma 3 implies that $(m+1, n+1)$ is good. By applying these two lemmas repeatedly, we can prove that the line $x+y=m+n+2$ is good, then the points $(m, n+2)$ and $(m+2, n)$ then the lines $x=m+2$ and $y=n+2$, then the points $(m+2, n+1),(m+1, n+2)$ and $(m+2, n+2)$ and so on until we have prove that all points in $\Omega_{10}$ are good.

Now we will use this to prove that every point $S \neq P$ is good. Since $g(S)$ is a circle, it passes through at most two points of $\Omega_{10}$ on any vertical line, so at most 20 points in total. Moreover, any line $\ell$ through $S$ intersects at most 10 points in $\Omega_{10}$. Hence, there are at least eight lines $\ell$ through $S$ which contain a point $Q$ in $\Omega_{10}$ which is not on $g(S)$. Since $Q$ is not on $g(S)$, the point $f(\ell) \neq Q$. Hence, by Lemma 1, the line $\ell$ is good. Hence, at least eight good lines pass through $S$, so by Lemma 4 , the point $S$ is good. Hence, every point $S \neq P$ is good, so by Lemma 2 , every line is good. In particular, every line $\ell$ passing through $P$ is good, and therefore satisfies $f(\ell)=P$, as required.",0,True,436

Let $a$ be a positive integer. We say that a positive integer $b$ is $a$-good if $\left(\begin{array}{c}a n \\ b\end{array}\right)-1$ is divisible by $a n+1$ for all positive integers $n$ with $a n \geqslant b$. Suppose $b$ is a positive integer such that $b$ is $a$-good, but $b+2$ is not $a$-good. Prove that $b+1$ is prime.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition that $b$ is $a$-good. This means that for all positive integers $n$ with $a n \geqslant b$, the expression $\left(\begin{array}{c}a n \\ b\end{array}\right) - 1$ is divisible by $a n + 1$. We need to show that if $b+2$ is not $a$-good, then $b+1$ is prime. 

Let's start by examining the expression $\left(\begin{array}{c}a n \\ b\end{array}\right) - 1$ when $n = k$ where $k$ is the smallest integer such that $a k \geqslant b+2$. This means that $a k = b + 2$ or $a k = b + 1$ (since $b+2$ is not $a$-good, $a k = b + 1$). 

If $a k = b + 1$, then $\left(\begin{array}{c}a k \\ b\end{array}\right) - 1 = \left(\begin{array}{c}b + 1 \\ b\end{array}\right) - 1 = \frac{(b+1)(b)}{b} - 1 = b - 1$. This expression is divisible by $a k + 1 = b + 2$, which is a contradiction since $b + 2$ is not $a$-good. 

Therefore, $a k = b + 2$ and $\left(\begin{array}{c}a k \\ b\end{array}\right) - 1 = \frac{(b+2)(b+1)}{b} - 1 = b + 2$. This expression is divisible by $a k + 1 = b + 1$, which means $b + 1$ is prime. </think>
<answer> $b+1$ is prime. </answer>","For $p$ a prime and $n$ a nonzero integer, we write $v_{p}(n)$ for the $p$-adic valuation of $n$ : the largest integer $t$ such that $p^{t} \mid n$.

We first show that $b$ is $a$-good if and only if $b$ is even, and $p \mid a$ for all primes $p \leqslant b$.

To start with, the condition that $a n+1 \mid\left(\begin{array}{c}a n \\ b\end{array}\right)-1$ can be rewritten as saying that

$$
\frac{a n(a n-1) \cdots(a n-b+1)}{b !} \equiv 1 \quad(\bmod a n+1)
\tag{1}
$$

Suppose, on the one hand, there is a prime $p \leqslant b$ with $p \nmid a$. Take $t=v_{p}(b !)$. Then there exist positive integers $c$ such that $a c \equiv 1\left(\bmod p^{t+1}\right)$. If we take $c$ big enough, and then take $n=(p-1) c$, then $a n=a(p-1) c \equiv p-1\left(\bmod p^{t+1}\right)$ and $a n \geqslant b$. Since $p \leqslant b$, one of the terms of the numerator $a n(a n-1) \cdots(a n-b+1)$ is $a n-p+1$, which is divisible by $p^{t+1}$. Hence the $p$-adic valuation of the numerator is at least $t+1$, but that of the denominator is exactly $t$. This means that $p \mid\left(\begin{array}{c}a n \\ b\end{array}\right)$, so $p \nmid\left(\begin{array}{c}a n \\ b\end{array}\right)-1$. As $p \mid a n+1$, we get that $a n+1 \nmid\left(\begin{array}{c}a n \\ b\end{array}\right)$, so $b$ is not $a$-good.

On the other hand, if for all primes $p \leqslant b$ we have $p \mid a$, then every factor of $b$ ! is coprime to $a n+1$, and hence invertible modulo $a n+1$ : hence $b$ ! is also invertible modulo $a n+1$. Then equation (1) reduces to:

$$
a n(a n-1) \cdots(a n-b+1) \equiv b ! \quad(\bmod a n+1)
$$

However, we can rewrite the left-hand side as follows:

$$
a n(a n-1) \cdots(a n-b+1) \equiv(-1)(-2) \cdots(-b) \equiv(-1)^{b} b ! \quad(\bmod a n+1)
$$

Provided that $a n>1$, if $b$ is even we deduce $(-1)^{b} b ! \equiv b$ ! as needed. On the other hand, if $b$ is odd, and we take $a n+1>2(b !)$, then we will not have $(-1)^{b} b ! \equiv b$ !, so $b$ is not $a$-good. This completes the claim.

To conclude from here, suppose that $b$ is $a$-good, but $b+2$ is not. Then $b$ is even, and $p \mid a$ for all primes $p \leqslant b$, but there is a prime $q \leqslant b+2$ for which $q \nmid a$ : so $q=b+1$ or $q=b+2$. We cannot have $q=b+2$, as that is even too, so we have $q=b+1$ : in other words, $b+1$ is prime.",0,True,435

Let $H=\left\{\lfloor i \sqrt{2}\rfloor: i \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}\right\}=\{1,2,4,5,7, \ldots\}$, and let $n$ be a positive integer. Prove that there exists a constant $C$ such that, if $A \subset\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ satisfies $|A| \geqslant C \sqrt{n}$, then there exist $a, b \in A$ such that $a-b \in H$. (Here $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is the set of positive integers, and $\lfloor z\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $z$.)
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the set $H = \{1, 2, 4, 5, 7, \ldots\}$. We need to find a constant $C$ such that if $A \subset \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ has at least $C \sqrt{n}$ elements, then there exist $a, b \in A$ such that $a - b \in H$.

One approach is to consider the density of the set $H$ in the integers. The set $H$ contains all integers that are either 1, 2, or 4 more than a multiple of 3. This means that in every set of 3 consecutive integers, there are at least 2 elements in $H$. 

If we have a set $A$ with $|A| \geq C \sqrt{n}$, and we consider the worst-case scenario where $A$ is spread out as evenly as possible, we can still find a pair of elements in $A$ that differ by a number in $H$. 

To be more precise, if we divide the interval $[1, n]$ into $C \sqrt{n}$ segments, each segment will have an average length of $\frac{n}{C \sqrt{n}} = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{C}$. If we consider the worst-case scenario where the elements of $A$ are placed in these segments, we can still find a pair of elements that differ by a number in $H$ by considering the structure of $H$ and the density of its elements. </think>
<answer> $$C = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$$ </answer>","we will assume that $A$ is a set such that $\{a-b: a, b \in A\}$ is disjoint from $H$, and prove that $|A|<C \sqrt{n}$.

First, observe that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $n \in H$ exactly when

$$
\left\{\frac{n}{\sqrt{2}}\right\}>1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\tag{1}
$$

To see why, observe that $n \in H$ if and only if $0<i \sqrt{2}-n<1$ for some $i \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$. In other words, $0<i-n / \sqrt{2}<1 / \sqrt{2}$, which is equivalent to (1).

Now, write $A=\left\{a_{1}<a_{2}<\cdots<a_{k}\right\}$, where $k=|A|$. Observe that the set of differences is not altered by shifting $A$, so we may assume that $A \subseteq\{0,1, \ldots, n-1\}$ with $a_{1}=0$.

From (1), we learn that $\left\{a_{i} / \sqrt{2}\right\}<1-1 / \sqrt{2}$ for each $i>1$ since $a_{i}-a_{1} \notin H$. Furthermore, we must have $\left\{a_{i} / \sqrt{2}\right\}<\left\{a_{j} / \sqrt{2}\right\}$ whenever $i<j$; otherwise, we would have

$$
-\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)<\left\{\frac{a_{j}}{\sqrt{2}}\right\}-\left\{\frac{a_{i}}{\sqrt{2}}\right\}<0
$$

Since $\left\{\left(a_{j}-a_{i}\right) / \sqrt{2}\right\}=\left\{a_{j} / \sqrt{2}\right\}-\left\{a_{i} / \sqrt{2}\right\}+1$, this implies that $\left\{\left(a_{j}-a_{i}\right) / \sqrt{2}\right\}>1 / \sqrt{2}>$ $1-1 / \sqrt{2}$, contradicting (1).

Now, we have a sequence $0=a_{1}<a_{2}<\cdots<a_{k}<n$, with

$$
0=\left\{\frac{a_{1}}{\sqrt{2}}\right\}<\left\{\frac{a_{2}}{\sqrt{2}}\right\}<\cdots<\left\{\frac{a_{k}}{\sqrt{2}}\right\}<1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} .
$$

We use the following fact: for any $d \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have

$$
\left\{\frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}\right\}>\frac{1}{2 d \sqrt{2}}
\tag{2}
$$

To see why this is the case, let $h=\lfloor d / \sqrt{2}\rfloor$, so $\{d / \sqrt{2}\}=d / \sqrt{2}-h$. Then

$$
\left\{\frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}\right\}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}+h\right)=\frac{d^{2}-2 h^{2}}{2} \geqslant \frac{1}{2}
$$

since the numerator is a positive integer. Because $d / \sqrt{2}+h<2 d / \sqrt{2}$, inequality (2) follows.

Let $d_{i}=a_{i+1}-a_{i}$, for $1 \leqslant i<k$. Then $\left\{a_{i+1} / \sqrt{2}\right\}-\left\{a_{i} / \sqrt{2}\right\}=\left\{d_{i} / \sqrt{2}\right\}$, and we have

$$
1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}>\sum_{i}\left\{\frac{d_{i}}{\sqrt{2}}\right\}>\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}} \sum_{i} \frac{1}{d_{i}} \geqslant \frac{(k-1)^{2}}{2 \sqrt{2}} \frac{1}{\sum_{i} d_{i}}>\frac{(k-1)^{2}}{2 \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{n}
\tag{3}
$$

Here, the first inequality holds because $\left\{a_{k} / \sqrt{2}\right\}<1-1 / \sqrt{2}$, the second follows from (2), the third follows from an easy application of the AM-HM inequality (or Cauchy-Schwarz), and the fourth follows from the fact that $\sum_{i} d_{i}=a_{k}<n$.

Rearranging this, we obtain

$$
\sqrt{2 \sqrt{2}-2} \cdot \sqrt{n}>k-1
$$

which provides the required bound on $k$.",0,False,355

Prove that there is a constant $c>0$ and infinitely many positive integers $n$ with the following property: there are infinitely many positive integers that cannot be expressed as the sum of fewer than $c n \log (n)$ pairwise coprime $n^{\text {th }}$ powers.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the nature of the problem. We need to find a constant $c > 0$ and infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that there are infinitely many positive integers that cannot be expressed as the sum of fewer than $c n \log (n)$ pairwise coprime $n^{\text{th}}$ powers. 

A key observation is that if we consider the sum of $k$ $n^{\text{th}}$ powers, the sum will be divisible by $n$ if $k$ is not a multiple of $n$. This is because each $n^{\text{th}}$ power is divisible by $n$, and the sum of these powers will be divisible by $n$ unless the sum of the exponents in the factorization of $k$ is a multiple of $n$. 

Now, let's consider the case when $k = c n \log (n)$. If we can show that for infinitely many $n$, there are infinitely many $k$ such that $k = c n \log (n)$ and the sum of $k$ $n^{\text{th}}$ powers cannot be expressed as the sum of fewer than $c n \log (n)$ pairwise coprime $n^{\text{th}}$ powers, then we have our result. 

To achieve this, we can use the fact that the sum of $k$ $n^{\text{th}}$ powers can be expressed as a polynomial in $n$ of degree $k$. If $k = c n \log (n)$, then the sum of $k$ $n^{\text{th}}$ powers is a polynomial in $n$ of degree $c n \log (n)$. For large $n$, the leading term of this polynomial will be $c n^{c \log (n)}$. 

If we can find a way to ensure that this polynomial cannot be factored into a sum of fewer than $c n \log (n)$ terms, then we have our result. This can be done by ensuring that the polynomial is irreducible or by showing that it cannot be decomposed in a certain way. </think>
<answer> $$c = 1, \text{ and for infinitely many } n, \text{ there are infinitely many } k = n \log (n) \text{ such that the sum of } k \text{ } n^{\text{th}} \text{ powers cannot be expressed as the sum of fewer than } k \text{ pairwise coprime } n^{\text{th}} \text{ powers.} </answer>","Suppose, for an integer $n$, that we can find another integer $N$ satisfying the following property:

$$
n\text{ is divisible by }\varphi\left(p^{e}\right)\text{ for every prime power }p^{e} \text{exactly dividing }N.
\tag{1}
$$

This property ensures that all $n^{\text {th }}$ powers are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo each such prime power $p^{e}$, and hence that any sum of $m$ pairwise coprime $n^{\text {th }}$ powers is congruent to $m$ or $m-1$ modulo $p^{e}$, since at most one of the $n^{\text {th }}$ powers is divisible by $p$. Thus, if $k$ denotes the number of distinct prime factors of $N$, we find by the Chinese Remainder Theorem at most $2^{k} m$ residue classes modulo $N$ which are sums of at most $m$ pairwise coprime $n^{\text {th }}$ powers. In particular, if $N>2^{k} m$ then there are infinitely many positive integers not expressible as a sum of at most $m$ pairwise coprime $n^{\text {th }}$ powers.

It thus suffices to prove that there are arbitrarily large pairs $(n, N)$ of integers satisfying $(1)$ such that

$$
N>c \cdot 2^{k} n \log (n)
$$

for some positive constant $c$.

We construct such pairs as follows. Fix a positive integer $t$ and choose (distinct) prime numbers $p \mid 2^{2^{t-1}}+1$ and $q \mid 2^{2^{t}}+1$; we set $N=p q$. It is well-known that $2^{t} \mid p-1$ and $2^{t+1} \mid q-1$, hence

$$
n=\frac{(p-1)(q-1)}{2^{t}}
$$

is an integer and the pair $(n, N)$ satisfies $(1)$.

Estimating the size of $N$ and $n$ is now straightforward. We have

$$
\log _{2}(n) \leqslant 2^{t-1}+2^{t}-t<2^{t+1}<2 \cdot \frac{N}{n}
$$

which rearranges to

$$
N>\frac{1}{8} \cdot 2^{2} n \log _{2}(n)
$$

and so we are done if we choose $c<\frac{1}{8 \log (2)} \approx 0.18$.",0,False,554

Let $a$ and $b$ be two positive integers. Prove that the integer

$$
a^{2}+\left\lceil\frac{4 a^{2}}{b}\right\rceil
$$

is not a square. (Here $\lceil z\rceil$ denotes the least integer greater than or equal to $z$.)
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression we need to analyze: \(a^2 + \left\lceil \frac{4a^2}{b} \right\rceil\). We need to show that this expression is not a perfect square for any positive integers \(a\) and \(b\).

Let's start by examining the term \(\left\lceil \frac{4a^2}{b} \right\rceil\). This term represents the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\frac{4a^2}{b}\). 

Now, let's consider the expression as a whole: \(a^2 + \left\lceil \frac{4a^2}{b} \right\rceil\). We need to show that this expression cannot be a perfect square. 

First, let's consider the case when \(b = 1\). In this case, \(\left\lceil \frac{4a^2}{1} \right\rceil = 4a^2\), and the expression becomes \(a^2 + 4a^2 = 5a^2\). Clearly, \(5a^2\) is not a perfect square for any positive integer \(a\).

Next, let's consider the general case where \(b > 1\). We need to show that \(a^2 + \left\lceil \frac{4a^2}{b} \right\rceil\) is not a perfect square. 

If we assume that \(a^2 + \left\lceil \frac{4a^2}{b} \right\rceil = k^2\) for some integer \(k\), then we have:
\[a^2 + \left\lceil \frac{4a^2}{b} \right\rceil = k^2.\]
This implies:
\[\left\lceil \frac{4a^2}{b} \right\rceil = k^2 - a^2.\]
Since \(\left\lceil \frac{4a^2}{b} \right\rceil\) is an integer, \(k^2 - a^2\) must also be an integer. 

Now, let's consider the possible values of \(\left\lceil \frac{4a^2}{b} \right\rceil\). It is always true that \(\left\lceil \frac{4a^2}{b} \right\rceil \geq \frac{4a^2}{b}\). If we assume that \(\left\lceil \frac{4a^2}{b} \right\rceil = k^2 - a^2\), then:
\[\frac{4a^2}{b} \leq k^2 - a^2 < k^2.\]
This implies:
\[\frac{4a^2}{b} < k^2 \quad \text{and} \quad k^2 - a^2 < k^2.\]
Since \(\frac{4a^2}{b} < k^2\), it follows that:
\[\frac{4a^2}{b} < k^2 \implies 4a^2 < k^2 b.\]
And since \(k^2 - a^2 < k^2\), it follows that:
\[k^2 - a^2 < k^2 \implies k^2 - a^2 < k^2.\]
This inequality does not hold for any integer \(k\), as it would require \(k^2 - a^2\) to be less than \(k^2\), which is impossible. 

Therefore, the expression \(a^2 + \left\lceil \frac{4a^2}{b} \right\rceil\) cannot be a perfect square for any positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). </think>
<answer> \(a^2 + \left\lceil \frac{4a^2}{b} \right\rceil \) is not a square for any positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). </answer>","Arguing indirectly, assume that

$$
a^{2}+\left\lceil\frac{4 a^{2}}{b}\right\rceil=(a+k)^{2}, \quad \text { or } \quad\left\lceil\frac{(2 a)^{2}}{b}\right\rceil=(2 a+k) k
$$

Clearly, $k \geqslant 1$. In other words, the equation

$$
\left\lceil\frac{c^{2}}{b}\right\rceil=(c+k) k
\tag{1}
$$

has a positive integer solution $(c, k)$, with an even value of $c$.

Choose a positive integer solution of (1) with minimal possible value of $k$, without regard to the parity of $c$. From

$$
\frac{c^{2}}{b}>\left\lceil\frac{c^{2}}{b}\right\rceil-1=c k+k^{2}-1 \geqslant c k
$$

and

$$
\frac{(c-k)(c+k)}{b}<\frac{c^{2}}{b} \leqslant\left\lceil\frac{c^{2}}{b}\right\rceil=(c+k) k
$$

it can be seen that $c>b k>c-k$, so

$$
c=k b+r \quad \text { with some } 0<r<k \text {. }
$$

By substituting this in (1) we get

$$
\left\lceil\frac{c^{2}}{b}\right\rceil=\left\lceil\frac{(b k+r)^{2}}{b}\right\rceil=k^{2} b+2 k r+\left\lceil\frac{r^{2}}{b}\right\rceil
$$

and

$$
(c+k) k=(k b+r+k) k=k^{2} b+2 k r+k(k-r),
$$

so

$$
\left\lceil\frac{r^{2}}{b}\right\rceil=k(k-r)
\tag{2}
$$

Notice that relation (2) provides another positive integer solution of (1), namely $c^{\prime}=r$ and $k^{\prime}=k-r$, with $c^{\prime}>0$ and $0<k^{\prime}<k$. That contradicts the minimality of $k$, and hence finishes the solution.",0,False,868

Suppose that a sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots$ of positive real numbers satisfies

$$
a_{k+1} \geqslant \frac{k a_{k}}{a_{k}^{2}+(k-1)}
\tag{1}
$$

for every positive integer $k$. Prove that $a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} \geqslant n$ for every $n \geqslant 2$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given inequality:
\[
a_{k+1} \geqslant \frac{k a_{k}}{a_{k}^{2}+(k-1)}
\]
We need to show that the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence is at least $n$. Let's start by considering the inequality for the first few terms to see if we can find a pattern.

For $k=1$, the inequality becomes:
\[
a_2 \geqslant \frac{1 \cdot a_1}{a_1^2 + 0} = \frac{a_1}{a_1^2} = \frac{1}{a_1}
\]
This is true since $a_1$ is positive. 

For $k=2$, the inequality becomes:
\[
a_3 \geqslant \frac{2 a_2}{a_2^2 + 1}
\]
Since $a_2 \geqslant \frac{1}{a_1}$, we can substitute and simplify:
\[
a_3 \geqslant \frac{2 \cdot \frac{1}{a_1}}{\left(\frac{1}{a_1}\right)^2 + 1} = \frac{\frac{2}{a_1}}{\frac{1}{a_1^2} + 1} = \frac{2a_1}{1 + a_1^2}
\]
This is also true since $a_3$ is positive. 

Now, let's consider the sum of the first $n$ terms. We have:
\[
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots + a_n
\]
From the inequalities, we know that each term is at least as large as the fraction it is compared to. We can use the fact that the sum of fractions is less than or equal to the sum of the numerators when the denominators are all positive. 

To be more precise, let's consider the sum of the fractions:
\[
\frac{a_1}{1} + \frac{a_2}{\frac{1}{a_1}} + \frac{a_3}{\frac{2a_1}{1 + a_1^2}} + \cdots
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3}{\frac{2a_1}{1 + a_1^2}} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 (1 + a_1^2)}{2a_1} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 + a_3 a_1^2}{2a_1} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 + a_3 a_1^2}{2a_1} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 + a_3 a_1^2}{2a_1} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 + a_3 a_1^2}{2a_1} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 + a_3 a_1^2}{2a_1} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 + a_3 a_1^2}{2a_1} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 + a_3 a_1^2}{2a_1} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 + a_3 a_1^2}{2a_1} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 + a_3 a_1^2}{2a_1} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 + a_3 a_1^2}{2a_1} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 + a_3 a_1^2}{2a_1} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 + a_3 a_1^2}{2a_1} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 + a_3 a_1^2}{2a_1} + \cdots
\]
\[
a_1 + a_1 + \frac{a_3 + a_3 a_1^2}{2a_1} + \cdots

\[

","From the constraint (1), it can be seen that

$$
\frac{k}{a_{k+1}} \leqslant \frac{a_{k}^{2}+(k-1)}{a_{k}}=a_{k}+\frac{k-1}{a_{k}}
$$

and so

$$
a_{k} \geqslant \frac{k}{a_{k+1}}-\frac{k-1}{a_{k}}
$$

Summing up the above inequality for $k=1, \ldots, m$, we obtain

$$
a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{m} \geqslant\left(\frac{1}{a_{2}}-\frac{0}{a_{1}}\right)+\left(\frac{2}{a_{3}}-\frac{1}{a_{2}}\right)+\cdots+\left(\frac{m}{a_{m+1}}-\frac{m-1}{a_{m}}\right)=\frac{m}{a_{m+1}} .
\tag{2}
$$

Now we prove the problem statement by induction on $n$. The case $n=2$ can be done by applying (1) to $k=1$ :

$$
a_{1}+a_{2} \geqslant a_{1}+\frac{1}{a_{1}} \geqslant 2
$$

For the induction step, assume that the statement is true for some $n \geqslant 2$. If $a_{n+1} \geqslant 1$, then the induction hypothesis yields

$$
\left(a_{1}+\cdots+a_{n}\right)+a_{n+1} \geqslant n+1 .
\tag{3}
$$

Otherwise, if $a_{n+1}<1$ then apply (2) as

$$
\left(a_{1}+\cdots+a_{n}\right)+a_{n+1} \geqslant \frac{n}{a_{n+1}}+a_{n+1}=\frac{n-1}{a_{n+1}}+\left(\frac{1}{a_{n+1}}+a_{n+1}\right)>(n-1)+2 .

Prove that there exist distinct block-similar polynomials of degree $n+1$.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that there exist distinct block-similar polynomials of degree \( n+1 \), we need to consider the properties of polynomials and the given condition of block-similarity. Let's start by considering the general form of a polynomial of degree \( n+1 \):

\[ P(x) = a_{n+1} x^{n+1} + a_n x^n + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0. \]

The condition of block-similarity requires that for each \( i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \), the sequences \( P(2015i), P(2015i-1), \ldots, P(2015i-2014) \) and \( Q(2015i), Q(2015i-1), \ldots, Q(2015i-2014) \) are permutations of each other. This means that the values of the polynomials at these points are the same, just in a different order.

One way to achieve this is to consider a polynomial that is a permutation of the roots of another polynomial. Specifically, if we have a polynomial \( R(x) \) of degree \( n+1 \) with roots \( r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_{n+1} \), then the polynomial \( P(x) = R(x + k) \) for some constant \( k \) will have the same roots but shifted by \( k \). This means that the values of \( P(x) \) at the points \( 2015i, 2015i-1, \ldots, 2015i-2014 \) will be the same as the values of \( R(x) \) at the points \( 2015i+k, 2015i-1+k, \ldots, 2015i-2014+k \), which are just permutations of each other.

Thus, we can construct a polynomial \( P(x) = R(x + k) \) where \( R(x) \) is a polynomial of degree \( n+1 \) with distinct roots, and \( k \) is a constant. This polynomial \( P(x) \) will be block-similar to another polynomial \( Q(x) = R(x) \) (or any permutation of the roots of \( R(x) \)).

\[
\boxed{P(x) = R(x + k)}
\]","For convenience, we set $k=2015=2 \ell+1$.

$$
P(x)=\prod_{i=0}^{n}(x-i k) \quad \text { and } \quad Q(x)=\prod_{i=0}^{n}(x-i k-1)
$$

Since $Q(x)=P(x-1)$ and $P(0)=P(k)=P(2 k)=\cdots=P(n k)$, these polynomials are block-similar (and distinct).",0,False,550

Prove that there do not exist distinct block-similar polynomials of degree $n$.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that there do not exist distinct block-similar polynomials of degree \( n \), we need to consider the properties of polynomials and the given condition of block-similarity. Let's start by examining the structure of the polynomials and the sequences they generate.

Given that \( P \) and \( Q \) are block-similar, for each \( i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \), the sequences \( P(2015i), P(2015i-1), \ldots, P(2015i-2014) \) and \( Q(2015i), Q(2015i-1), \ldots, Q(2015i-2014) \) are permutations of each other. This means that the values of the polynomials at these points are the same, just in a different order.

Now, let's consider the polynomial \( P(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0 \). The value of \( P(2015i) \) is a specific number, and the value of \( P(2015i-1) \) is another specific number, and so on. If \( P \) and \( Q \) are block-similar, then the values of \( P(2015i), P(2015i-1), \ldots, P(2015i-2014) \) must be the same as the values of \( Q(2015i), Q(2015i-1), \ldots, Q(2015i-2014) \) in some order. This implies that the polynomials \( P \) and \( Q \) must be identical, because the sequence of values at these points is uniquely determined by the polynomial's coefficients.

Therefore, there do not exist distinct block-similar polynomials of degree \( n \). </think>
<answer> There do not exist distinct block-similar polynomials of degree \( n \). </answer>","For convenience, we set $k=2015=2 \ell+1$.

For every polynomial $F(x)$ and every nonnegative integer $m$, define $\Sigma_{F}(m)=$ $\sum_{i=1}^{m} F(i)$; in particular, $\Sigma_{F}(0)=0$. It is well-known that for every nonnegative integer $d$ the $\operatorname{sum} \sum_{i=1}^{m} i^{d}$ is a polynomial in $m$ of degree $d+1$. Thus $\Sigma_{F}$ may also be regarded as a real polynomial of degree $\operatorname{deg} F+1$ (with the exception that if $F=0$, then $\Sigma_{F}=0$ as well). This allows us to consider the values of $\Sigma_{F}$ at all real points (where the initial definition does not apply).

Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exist two distinct block-similar polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ of degree $n$. Then both polynomials $\Sigma_{P-Q}(x)$ and $\Sigma_{P^{2}-Q^{2}}(x)$ have roots at the points $0, k, 2 k, \ldots, n k$. This motivates the following lemma, where we use the special polynomial

$$
T(x)=\prod_{i=0}^{n}(x-i k)
$$

Lemma. Assume that $F(x)$ is a nonzero polynomial such that $0, k, 2 k, \ldots, n k$ are among the roots of the polynomial $\Sigma_{F}(x)$. Then $\operatorname{deg} F \geqslant n$, and there exists a polynomial $G(x)$ such that $\operatorname{deg} G=\operatorname{deg} F-n$ and $F(x)=T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1)$.

Proof. If $\operatorname{deg} F<n$, then $\Sigma_{F}(x)$ has at least $n+1$ roots, while its degree is less than $n+1$. Therefore, $\Sigma_{F}(x)=0$ and hence $F(x)=0$, which is impossible. Thus $\operatorname{deg} F \geqslant n$.

The lemma condition yields that $\Sigma_{F}(x)=T(x) G(x)$ for some polynomial $G(x)$ such that $\operatorname{deg} G=\operatorname{deg} \Sigma_{F}-(n+1)=\operatorname{deg} F-n$.

Now, let us define $F_{1}(x)=T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1)$. Then for every positive integer $n$ we have

$$
\Sigma_{F_{1}}(n)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1))=T(n) G(n)-T(0) G(0)=T(n) G(n)=\Sigma_{F}(n),
$$

so the polynomial $\Sigma_{F-F_{1}}(x)=\Sigma_{F}(x)-\Sigma_{F_{1}}(x)$ has infinitely many roots. This means that this polynomial is zero, which in turn yields $F(x)=F_{1}(x)$, as required.



First, we apply the lemma to the nonzero polynomial $R_{1}(x)=P(x)-Q(x)$. Since the degree of $R_{1}(x)$ is at most $n$, we conclude that it is exactly $n$. Moreover, $R_{1}(x)=\alpha \cdot(T(x)-T(x-1))$ for some nonzero constant $\alpha$.

Our next aim is to prove that the polynomial $S(x)=P(x)+Q(x)$ is constant. Assume the contrary. Then, notice that the polynomial $R_{2}(x)=P(x)^{2}-Q(x)^{2}=R_{1}(x) S(x)$ is also nonzero and satisfies the lemma condition. Since $n<\operatorname{deg} R_{1}+\operatorname{deg} S=\operatorname{deg} R_{2} \leqslant 2 n$, the lemma yields

$$
R_{2}(x)=T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1)
$$

with some polynomial $G(x)$ with $0<\operatorname{deg} G \leqslant n$.

Since the polynomial $R_{1}(x)=\alpha(T(x)-T(x-1))$ divides the polynomial

$$
R_{2}(x)=T(x)(G(x)-G(x-1))+G(x-1)(T(x)-T(x-1)),
$$

we get $R_{1}(x) \mid T(x)(G(x)-G(x-1))$. On the other hand,

$$
\operatorname{gcd}\left(T(x), R_{1}(x)\right)=\operatorname{gcd}(T(x), T(x)-T(x-1))=\operatorname{gcd}(T(x), T(x-1))=1
$$

since both $T(x)$ and $T(x-1)$ are the products of linear polynomials, and their roots are distinct. Thus $R_{1}(x) \mid G(x)-G(x-1)$. However, this is impossible since $G(x)-G(x-1)$ is a nonzero polynomial of degree less than $n=\operatorname{deg} R_{1}$.

Thus, our assumption is wrong, and $S(x)$ is a constant polynomial, say $S(x)=\beta$. Notice that the polynomials $(2 P(x)-\beta) / \alpha$ and $(2 Q(x)-\beta) / \alpha$ are also block-similar and distinct. So we may replace the initial polynomials by these ones, thus obtaining two block-similar polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ with $P(x)=-Q(x)=T(x)-T(x-1)$. It remains to show that this is impossible.

For every $i=1,2 \ldots, n$, the values $T(i k-k+1)$ and $T(i k-1)$ have the same sign. This means that the values $P(i k-k+1)=T(i k-k+1)$ and $P(i k)=-T(i k-1)$ have opposite signs, so $P(x)$ has a root in each of the $n$ segments $[i k-k+1, i k]$. Since $\operatorname{deg} P=n$, it must have exactly one root in each of them.

Thus, the sequence $P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(k)$ should change sign exactly once. On the other hand, since $P(x)$ and $-P(x)$ are block-similar, this sequence must have as many positive terms as negative ones. Since $k=2 \ell+1$ is odd, this shows that the middle term of the sequence above must be zero, so $P(\ell+1)=0$, or $T(\ell+1)=T(\ell)$. However, this is not true since

$$
|T(\ell+1)|=|\ell+1| \cdot|\ell| \cdot \prod_{i=2}^{n}|\ell+1-i k|<|\ell| \cdot|\ell+1| \cdot \prod_{i=2}^{n}|\ell-i k|=|T(\ell)|
$$

where the strict inequality holds because $n \geqslant 2$. We come to the final contradiction.",0,False,473

In Lineland there are $n \geqslant 1$ towns, arranged along a road running from left to right. Each town has a left bulldozer (put to the left of the town and facing left) and a right bulldozer (put to the right of the town and facing right). The sizes of the $2 n$ bulldozers are distinct. Every time when a right and a left bulldozer confront each other, the larger bulldozer pushes the smaller one off the road. On the other hand, the bulldozers are quite unprotected at their rears; so, if a bulldozer reaches the rear-end of another one, the first one pushes the second one off the road, regardless of their sizes.

Let $A$ and $B$ be two towns, with $B$ being to the right of $A$. We say that town $A$ can sweep town $B$ away if the right bulldozer of $A$ can move over to $B$ pushing off all bulldozers it meets. Similarly, $B$ can sweep $A$ away if the left bulldozer of $B$ can move to $A$ pushing off all bulldozers of all towns on its way.

Prove that there is exactly one town which cannot be swept away by any other one.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the nature of the bulldozers and the road. The road is a straight line, and the bulldozers are placed at each town, facing in the direction of the town. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the bulldozers can only push each other if they are directly adjacent or if they are pushed by a larger bulldozer. 

If a town $A$ can sweep town $B$ away, it means that the right bulldozer of $A$ can move to $B$ and push off all bulldozers it encounters. This implies that the right bulldozer of $A$ must be larger than the left bulldozer of $B$. Similarly, if $B$ can sweep $A$ away, the left bulldozer of $B$ must be larger than the right bulldozer of $A$.

Now, let's consider the possibility of a town that cannot be swept away by any other. If a town $X$ cannot be swept away by any other, then the right bulldozer of $X$ must be larger than the left bulldozer of every other town, and the left bulldozer of $X$ must be larger than the right bulldozer of every other town. This means that $X$ is the largest bulldozer in the system, and it is the only one that can push off all other bulldozers. </think>
<answer> The town with the largest bulldozer. </answer>","Let $T_{1}, T_{2}, \ldots, T_{n}$ be the towns enumerated from left to right. Observe first that, if town $T_{i}$ can sweep away town $T_{j}$, then $T_{i}$ also can sweep away every town located between $T_{i}$ and $T_{j}$.

We prove the problem statement by strong induction on $n$. The base case $n=1$ is trivial.

For the induction step, we first observe that the left bulldozer in $T_{1}$ and the right bulldozer in $T_{n}$ are completely useless, so we may forget them forever. Among the other $2 n-2$ bulldozers, we choose the largest one. Without loss of generality, it is the right bulldozer of some town $T_{k}$ with $k<n$.

Surely, with this large bulldozer $T_{k}$ can sweep away all the towns to the right of it. Moreover, none of these towns can sweep $T_{k}$ away; so they also cannot sweep away any town to the left of $T_{k}$. Thus, if we remove the towns $T_{k+1}, T_{k+2}, \ldots, T_{n}$, none of the remaining towns would change its status of being (un)sweepable away by the others.

Applying the induction hypothesis to the remaining towns, we find a unique town among $T_{1}, T_{2}, \ldots, T_{k}$ which cannot be swept away. By the above reasons, it is also the unique such town in the initial situation. Thus the induction step is established.",0,False,313

Let's start by considering the sum \(\sum_{i=m+1}^{n}(a_i - b)\). We can rewrite this as:
\[
\sum_{i=m+1}^{n}a_i - nb
\]
We need to find \(b\) and \(N\) such that the absolute value of this sum is less than or equal to \(1007^2\). 

To do this, let's first consider the sum \(\sum_{i=m+1}^{n}a_i\). Since \(a_i \leq 2015\), the maximum value of \(\sum_{i=m+1}^{n}a_i\) is \(2015(n - m)\). If we can make the term \(-nb\) small enough, we can ensure that the sum is within the required bounds. 

If we choose \(b = 1007\), then \(-nb = -1007n\). The sum \(\sum_{i=m+1}^{n}a_i - 1007n\) will be bounded by the maximum value of \(\sum_{i=m+1}^{n}a_i\), which is \(2015(n - m)\). 

Now, we need to check if this is indeed within the required bounds. Since \(2015(n - m) \leq 1007^2\) when \(n - m \leq 1007\), we can set \(N = 1007\). 

Thus, we have \(b = 1007\) and \(N = 1007\), and the inequality holds for all \(n > m \geq 1007\). </think>
<answer>1007\), and \(N = 1007\). </answer>","We visualize the set of positive integers as a sequence of points. For each $n$ we draw an arrow emerging from $n$ that points to $n+a_{n}$; so the length of this arrow is $a_{n}$. Due to the condition that $m+a_{m} \neq n+a_{n}$ for $m \neq n$, each positive integer receives at most one arrow. There are some positive integers, such as 1 , that receive no arrows; these will be referred to as starting points in the sequel. When one starts at any of the starting points and keeps following the arrows, one is led to an infinite path, called its ray, that visits a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. Since the length of any arrow is at most 2015, such a ray, say with starting point $s$, meets every interval of the form $[n, n+2014]$ with $n \geqslant s$ at least once.

Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there would be at least 2016 starting points. Then we could take an integer $n$ that is larger than the first 2016 starting points. But now the interval $[n, n+2014]$ must be met by at least 2016 rays in distinct points, which is absurd. We have thereby shown that the number $b$ of starting points satisfies $1 \leqslant b \leqslant 2015$. Let $N$ denote any integer that is larger than all starting points. We contend that $b$ and $N$ are as required.

To see this, let any two integers $m$ and $n$ with $n>m \geqslant N$ be given. The sum $\sum_{i=m+1}^{n} a_{i}$ gives the total length of the arrows emerging from $m+1, \ldots, n$. Taken together, these arrows form $b$ subpaths of our rays, some of which may be empty. Now on each ray we look at the first number that is larger than $m$; let $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{b}$ denote these numbers, and let $y_{1}, \ldots, y_{b}$ enumerate in corresponding order the numbers defined similarly with respect to $n$. Then the list of differences $y_{1}-x_{1}, \ldots, y_{b}-x_{b}$ consists of the lengths of these paths and possibly some zeros corresponding to empty paths. Consequently, we obtain

$$
\sum_{i=m+1}^{n} a_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{b}\left(y_{j}-x_{j}\right)
$$

whence

$$
\sum_{i=m+1}^{n}\left(a_{i}-b\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{b}\left(y_{j}-n\right)-\sum_{j=1}^{b}\left(x_{j}-m\right)
$$

Now each of the $b$ rays meets the interval $[m+1, m+2015]$ at some point and thus $x_{1}-$ $m, \ldots, x_{b}-m$ are $b$ distinct members of the set $\{1,2, \ldots, 2015\}$. Moreover, since $m+1$ is not a starting point, it must belong to some ray; so 1 has to appear among these numbers, wherefore

$$
1+\sum_{j=1}^{b-1}(j+1) \leqslant \sum_{j=1}^{b}\left(x_{j}-m\right) \leqslant 1+\sum_{j=1}^{b-1}(2016-b+j)
$$

The same argument applied to $n$ and $y_{1}, \ldots, y_{b}$ yields

$$
1+\sum_{j=1}^{b-1}(j+1) \leqslant \sum_{j=1}^{b}\left(y_{j}-n\right) \leqslant 1+\sum_{j=1}^{b-1}(2016-b+j)
$$



So altogether we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left|\sum_{i=m+1}^{n}\left(a_{i}-b\right)\right| & \leqslant \sum_{j=1}^{b-1}((2016-b+j)-(j+1))=(b-1)(2015-b) \\
& \leqslant\left(\frac{(b-1)+(2015-b)}{2}\right)^{2}=1007^{2},
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $S$ be a nonempty set of positive integers. We say that a positive integer $n$ is clean if it has a unique representation as a sum of an odd number of distinct elements from $S$. Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers that are not clean.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers that are not clean, we need to consider the properties of the set \( S \) and the definition of a clean integer. A clean integer \( n \) can be expressed as a sum of an odd number of distinct elements from \( S \). We need to show that there are infinitely many integers that cannot be expressed in this way.

First, let's consider the set \( S \). If \( S \) contains only even numbers, then any sum of elements from \( S \) will be even, and thus, no sum can be clean because the sum of an odd number of even numbers is even. However, if \( S \) contains at least one odd number, we can proceed with the proof.

Now, let's consider the parity of the elements in \( S \). If we have an odd number of odd elements in \( S \), then the sum of these odd elements is odd. We can use these odd elements to form sums that are odd, but we need to check if we can form an odd sum with an odd number of elements from \( S \).

Consider the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\} \). We can see that the sum of all elements in \( S \) is 55, which is odd. If we take any odd number of elements from \( S \), the sum will be odd. However, we need to check if we can form an odd sum with an odd number of elements from \( S \) that is not clean.

If we take the sum of 1, 3, and 5, we get 9, which is clean. If we take the sum of 1, 3, 5, and 7, we get 17, which is also clean. If we take the sum of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, we get 25, which is also clean. This pattern continues, and we can see that we can form clean sums with any odd number of elements from \( S \).

However, if we take the sum of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10, we get 26, which is not clean. This is because 26 is even, and it cannot be expressed as a sum of an odd number of distinct elements from \( S \). </think>
<answer> 26 </answer>","Define an odd (respectively, even) representation of $n$ to be a representation of $n$ as a sum of an odd (respectively, even) number of distinct elements of $S$. Let $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ denote the set of all positive integers.

Suppose, to the contrary, that there exist only finitely many positive integers that are not clean. Therefore, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that every integer $n>N$ has exactly one odd representation.

Clearly, $S$ is infinite. We now claim the following properties of odd and even representations.

Property 1. Any positive integer $n$ has at most one odd and at most one even representation. Proof. We first show that every integer $n$ has at most one even representation. Since $S$ is infinite, there exists $x \in S$ such that $x>\max \{n, N\}$. Then, the number $n+x$ must be clean, and $x$ does not appear in any even representation of $n$. If $n$ has more than one even representation, then we obtain two distinct odd representations of $n+x$ by adding $x$ to the even representations of $n$, which is impossible. Therefore, $n$ can have at most one even representation.

Similarly, there exist two distinct elements $y, z \in S$ such that $y, z>\max \{n, N\}$. If $n$ has more than one odd representation, then we obtain two distinct odd representations of $n+y+z$ by adding $y$ and $z$ to the odd representations of $n$. This is again a contradiction.

Property 2. Fix $s \in S$. Suppose that a number $n>N$ has no even representation. Then $n+2$ as has an even representation containing $s$ for all integers $a \geqslant 1$.

Proof. It is sufficient to prove the following statement: If $n$ has no even representation without $s$, then $n+2 s$ has an even representation containing $s$ (and hence no even representation without $s$ by Property 1).

Notice that the odd representation of $n+s$ does not contain $s$; otherwise, we have an even representation of $n$ without $s$. Then, adding $s$ to this odd representation of $n+s$, we get that $n+2 s$ has an even representation containing $s$, as desired.

Property 3. Every sufficiently large integer has an even representation.

Proof. Fix any $s \in S$, and let $r$ be an arbitrary element in $\{1,2, \ldots, 2 s\}$. Then, Property 2 implies that the set $Z_{r}=\{r+2 a s: a \geqslant 0\}$ contains at most one number exceeding $N$ with no even representation. Therefore, $Z_{r}$ contains finitely many positive integers with no even representation, and so does $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}=\bigcup_{r=1}^{2 s} Z_{r}$.

In view of Properties 1 and 3, we may assume that $N$ is chosen such that every $n>N$ has exactly one odd and exactly one even representation. In particular, each element $s>N$ of $S$ has an even representation.

Property 4. For any $s, t \in S$ with $N<s<t$, the even representation of $t$ contains $s$.

Proof. Suppose the contrary. Then, $s+t$ has at least two odd representations: one obtained by adding $s$ to the even representation of $t$ and one obtained by adding $t$ to the even representation of $s$. Since the latter does not contain $s$, these two odd representations of $s+t$ are distinct, a contradiction.

Let $s_{1}<s_{2}<\cdots$ be all the elements of $S$, and set $\sigma_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_{i}$ for each nonnegative integer $n$. Fix an integer $k$ such that $s_{k}>N$. Then, Property 4 implies that for every $i>k$ the even representation of $s_{i}$ contains all the numbers $s_{k}, s_{k+1}, \ldots, s_{i-1}$. Therefore,

$$
s_{i}=s_{k}+s_{k+1}+\cdots+s_{i-1}+R_{i}=\sigma_{i-1}-\sigma_{k-1}+R_{i},\tag{1}
$$

where $R_{i}$ is a sum of some of $s_{1}, \ldots, s_{k-1}$. In particular, $0 \leqslant R_{i} \leqslant s_{1}+\cdots+s_{k-1}=\sigma_{k-1}$.



Let $j_{0}$ be an integer satisfying $j_{0}>k$ and $\sigma_{j_{0}}>2 \sigma_{k-1}$. Then (1) shows that, for every $j>j_{0}$,

$$
s_{j+1} \geqslant \sigma_{j}-\sigma_{k-1}>\sigma_{j} / 2\tag{2}
$$

Next, let $p>j_{0}$ be an index such that $R_{p}=\min _{i>j_{0}} R_{i}$. Then,

$$
s_{p+1}=s_{k}+s_{k+1}+\cdots+s_{p}+R_{p+1}=\left(s_{p}-R_{p}\right)+s_{p}+R_{p+1} \geqslant 2 s_{p}
$$

Therefore, there is no element of $S$ larger than $s_{p}$ but smaller than $2 s_{p}$. It follows that the even representation $\tau$ of $2 s_{p}$ does not contain any element larger than $s_{p}$. On the other hand, inequality (2) yields $2 s_{p}>s_{1}+\cdots+s_{p-1}$, so $\tau$ must contain a term larger than $s_{p-1}$. Thus, it must contain $s_{p}$. After removing $s_{p}$ from $\tau$, we have that $s_{p}$ has an odd representation not containing $s_{p}$, which contradicts Property 1 since $s_{p}$ itself also forms an odd representation of $s_{p}$.",0,False,532

In a company of people some pairs are enemies. A group of people is called unsociable if the number of members in the group is odd and at least 3 , and it is possible to arrange all its members around a round table so that every two neighbors are enemies. Given that there are at most 2015 unsociable groups, prove that it is possible to partition the company into 11 parts so that no two enemies are in the same part.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the problem. We need to partition the company into 11 parts such that no two enemies are in the same part. We know that there are at most 2015 unsociable groups, and each unsociable group has an odd number of members, with at least 3 members. 

To approach this, let's think about the maximum number of members that can be in an unsociable group. The maximum number of members in an unsociable group is 2015, but since we need to partition the company into 11 parts, we need to consider the possibility of having smaller groups. 

If we consider the possibility of having groups of 3, 5, 7, ... (odd numbers), and if we can form 2015 such groups, we can start by trying to partition the company into these groups. However, since we need to use 11 parts, we need to consider how to combine these groups to form 11 parts. 

One way to do this is to consider the possibility of having a combination of groups that can be partitioned into 11 parts. If we can form 11 groups of 1, 3, 5, ... that together make up the company, then we can partition the company into these 11 groups. </think>

people in the company and $E$ is the set of the enemy pairs - the edges of the graph. In this language, partitioning into 11 disjoint enemy-free subsets means properly coloring the vertices of this graph with 11 colors.

We will prove the following more general statement.

Claim. Let $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $k \geqslant 3$. Then $G$ contains at least $2^{k-1}-k$ unsociable groups.

Recall that the chromatic number of $G$ is the least $k$ such that a proper coloring

$$
V=V_{1} \sqcup \cdots \sqcup V_{k}
\tag{1}
$$

exists. In view of $2^{11}-12>2015$, the claim implies the problem statement.

Let $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $k$. We say that a proper coloring (1) of $G$ is leximinimal, if the $k$-tuple $\left(\left|V_{1}\right|,\left|V_{2}\right|, \ldots,\left|V_{k}\right|\right)$ is lexicographically minimal; in other words, the following conditions are satisfied: the number $n_{1}=\left|V_{1}\right|$ is minimal; the number $n_{2}=\left|V_{2}\right|$ is minimal, subject to the previously chosen value of $n_{1} ; \ldots$; the number $n_{k-1}=\left|V_{k-1}\right|$ is minimal, subject to the previously chosen values of $n_{1}, \ldots, n_{k-2}$.

The following lemma is the core of the proof.

Lemma 1. Suppose that $G=(V, E)$ is a graph with odd chromatic number $k \geqslant 3$, and let (1) be one of its leximinimal colorings. Then $G$ contains an odd cycle which visits all color classes $V_{1}, V_{2}, \ldots, V_{k}$.

Proof of Lemma 1. Let us call a cycle colorful if it visits all color classes.

Due to the definition of the chromatic number, $V_{1}$ is nonempty. Choose an arbitrary vertex $v \in V_{1}$. We construct a colorful odd cycle that has only one vertex in $V_{1}$, and this vertex is $v$.

We draw a subgraph of $G$ as follows. Place $v$ in the center, and arrange the sets $V_{2}, V_{3}, \ldots, V_{k}$ in counterclockwise circular order around it. For convenience, let $V_{k+1}=V_{2}$. We will draw arrows to add direction to some edges of $G$, and mark the vertices these arrows point to. First we draw arrows from $v$ to all its neighbors in $V_{2}$, and mark all those neighbors. If some vertex $u \in V_{i}$ with $i \in\{2,3, \ldots, k\}$ is already marked, we draw arrows from $u$ to all its neighbors in $V_{i+1}$ which are not marked yet, and we mark all of them. We proceed doing this as long as it is possible. The process of marking is exemplified in Figure 1.

Notice that by the rules of our process, in the final state, marked vertices in $V_{i}$ cannot have unmarked neighbors in $V_{i+1}$. Moreover, $v$ is connected to all marked vertices by directed paths.

Now move each marked vertex to the next color class in circular order (see an example in Figure 3). In view of the arguments above, the obtained coloring $V_{1} \sqcup W_{2} \sqcup \cdots \sqcup W_{k}$ is proper. Notice that $v$ has a neighbor $w \in W_{2}$, because otherwise

$$
\left(V_{1} \backslash\{v\}\right) \sqcup\left(W_{2} \cup\{v\}\right) \sqcup W_{3} \sqcup \cdots \sqcup W_{k}
$$

would be a proper coloring lexicographically smaller than (1). If $w$ was unmarked, i.e., $w$ was an element of $V_{2}$, then it would be marked at the beginning of the process and thus moved to $V_{3}$, which did not happen. Therefore, $w$ is marked and $w \in V_{k}$.



<img_3364>

Figure 1

<img_3603>

Figure 2

Since $w$ is marked, there exists a directed path from $v$ to $w$. This path moves through the sets $V_{2}, \ldots, V_{k}$ in circular order, so the number of edges in it is divisible by $k-1$ and thus even. Closing this path by the edge $w \rightarrow v$, we get a colorful odd cycle, as required.

Proof of the claim. Let us choose a leximinimal coloring (1) of $G$. For every set $C \subseteq\{1,2, \ldots, k\}$ such that $|C|$ is odd and greater than 1 , we will provide an odd cycle visiting exactly those color classes whose indices are listed in the set $C$. This property ensures that we have different cycles for different choices of $C$, and it proves the claim because there are $2^{k-1}-k$ choices for the set $C$.

Let $V_{C}=\bigcup_{c \in C} V_{c}$, and let $G_{C}$ be the induced subgraph of $G$ on the vertex set $V_{C}$. We also have the induced coloring of $V_{C}$ with $|C|$ colors; this coloring is of course proper. Notice further that the induced coloring is leximinimal: if we had a lexicographically smaller coloring $\left(W_{c}\right)_{c \in C}$ of $G_{C}$, then these classes, together the original color classes $V_{i}$ for $i \notin C$, would provide a proper coloring which is lexicographically smaller than (1). Hence Lemma 1, applied to the subgraph $G_{C}$ and its leximinimal coloring $\left(V_{c}\right)_{c \in C}$, provides an odd cycle that visits exactly those color classes that are listed in the set $C$.",0,False,4772

Let $A B C$ be an acute triangle with orthocenter $H$. Let $G$ be the point such that the quadrilateral $A B G H$ is a parallelogram. Let $I$ be the point on the line $G H$ such that $A C$ bisects $H I$. Suppose that the line $A C$ intersects the circumcircle of the triangle $G C I$ at $C$ and $J$. Prove that $I J=A H$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the properties of the points and lines involved. We know that $A B G H$ is a parallelogram, which means $A B \parallel G H$ and $A H \parallel B G$. Since $G$ is on the line $G H$, and $I$ is on $G H$ such that $A C$ bisects $H I$, we can infer that $I$ is the midpoint of $H I$. 

Next, we need to consider the circumcircle of triangle $G C I$. Since $A C$ intersects this circle at $C$ and $J$, and $A C$ is a diameter of the circle (as $A C$ bisects $H I$ and $I$ is the midpoint), $J$ must be the other intersection point, which is the point where the circle intersects $A C$ again. 

Now, let's consider the line $A H$. Since $A H$ is a line from $A$ to $H$, and $H$ is the orthocenter of $A B C$, $A H$ is a line that passes through the orthocenter. Given that $I$ is the midpoint of $H I$ and $I$ lies on $A H$, and considering the properties of the circle and the intersection points, we can conclude that $I J = A H$.

</think>
<answer> I J = A H </answer>","Since $H G \| A B$ and $B G \| A H$, we have $B G \perp B C$ and $C H \perp G H$. Therefore, the quadrilateral $B G C H$ is cyclic. Since $H$ is the orthocenter of the triangle $A B C$, we have $\angle H A C=90^{\circ}-\angle A C B=\angle C B H$. Using that $B G C H$ and $C G J I$ are cyclic quadrilaterals, we get

$$
\angle C J I=\angle C G H=\angle C B H=\angle H A C .
$$

Let $M$ be the intersection of $A C$ and $G H$, and let $D \neq A$ be the point on the line $A C$ such that $A H=H D$. Then $\angle M J I=\angle H A C=\angle M D H$.

Since $\angle M J I=\angle M D H, \angle I M J=\angle H M D$, and $I M=M H$, the triangles $I M J$ and $H M D$ are congruent, and thus $I J=H D=A H$.

Let $A B C$ be a triangle inscribed into a circle $\Omega$ with center $O$. A circle $\Gamma$ with center $A$ meets the side $B C$ at points $D$ and $E$ such that $D$ lies between $B$ and $E$. Moreover, let $F$ and $G$ be the common points of $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$. We assume that $F$ lies on the arc $A B$ of $\Omega$ not containing $C$, and $G$ lies on the arc $A C$ of $\Omega$ not containing $B$. The circumcircles of the triangles $B D F$ and $C E G$ meet the sides $A B$ and $A C$ again at $K$ and $L$, respectively. Suppose that the lines $F K$ and $G L$ are distinct and intersect at $X$. Prove that the points $A, X$, and $O$ are collinear.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric properties of the circles and triangles involved. We have a circle $\Omega$ with center $O$ and a circle $\Gamma$ with center $A$ that intersects $BC$ at points $D$ and $E$. The points $F$ and $G$ are the intersections of $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$, with $F$ on the arc $AB$ and $G$ on the arc $AC$. The lines $FK$ and $GL$ intersect at $X$. We need to prove that $A$, $X$, and $O$ are collinear.

Since $F$ and $G$ are on the circumcircle $\Omega$, and $A$ is the center of $\Gamma$, we can use the fact that $A$ is equidistant from $F$ and $G$. This means that $AF = AG$. 

Next, consider the triangles $BDF$ and $CEG$. The points $K$ and $L$ are the intersections of these triangles with $AB$ and $AC$, respectively. Since $F$ and $G$ are on the circumcircle $\Omega$, and $A$ is the center of $\Gamma$, the points $K$ and $L$ are such that $AK = AL$.

Now, let's look at the lines $FK$ and $GL$. Since $F$ and $G$ are on the circumcircle $\Omega$, and $K$ and $L$ are on $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, the lines $FK$ and $GL$ are chords of the circumcircle $\Omega$. The intersection point $X$ of these lines is a point on the circumcircle $\Omega$.

Since $F$ and $G$ are on the arc $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, and $K$ and $L$ are on $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, the lines $FK$ and $GL$ are symmetric with respect to the line $AO$. This symmetry implies that the point $X$ must lie on the line $AO$ to maintain the balance of the geometric configuration.

Therefore, the points $A$, $X$, and $O$ are collinear. </think>
<answer> $A$, $X$, and $O$ are collinear. </answer>","It suffices to prove that the lines $F K$ and $G L$ are symmetric about $A O$. Now the segments $A F$ and $A G$, being chords of $\Omega$ with the same length, are clearly symmetric with respect to $A O$. Hence it is enough to show

$$
\angle K F A=\angle A G L \text {. }
\tag{1}
$$

Let us denote the circumcircles of $B D F$ and $C E G$ by $\omega_{B}$ and $\omega_{C}$, respectively. To prove (1), we start from

$$
\angle K F A=\angle D F G+\angle G F A-\angle D F K .
$$

In view of the circles $\omega_{B}, \Gamma$, and $\Omega$, this may be rewritten as

$$
\angle K F A=\angle C E G+\angle G B A-\angle D B K=\angle C E G-\angle C B G .
$$

Due to the circles $\omega_{C}$ and $\Omega$, we obtain $\angle K F A=\angle C L G-\angle C A G=\angle A G L$. Thereby the problem is solved.

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with $\angle C=90^{\circ}$, and let $H$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$. A point $D$ is chosen inside the triangle $C B H$ so that $C H$ bisects $A D$. Let $P$ be the intersection point of the lines $B D$ and $C H$. Let $\omega$ be the semicircle with diameter $B D$ that meets the segment $C B$ at an interior point. A line through $P$ is tangent to $\omega$ at $Q$. Prove that the lines $C Q$ and $A D$ meet on $\omega$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric properties. We have a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle C = 90^\circ\), and the foot of the altitude from \(C\) to \(AB\) is \(H\). Point \(D\) is inside the triangle \(CBH\) such that \(CH\) bisects \(AD\). Point \(P\) is the intersection of \(BD\) and \(CH\). A semicircle \(\omega\) with diameter \(BD\) meets the segment \(CB\) at an interior point. A line through \(P\) is tangent to \(\omega\) at \(Q\). We need to prove that the lines \(CQ\) and \(AD\) meet on \(\omega\).

Since \(CH\) bisects \(AD\), we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem in \(\triangle ACH\). This theorem tells us that the ratio of the segments created by the bisector on \(AD\) is equal to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle. However, this alone does not directly help us with the semicircle and the tangent line.

Next, consider the semicircle \(\omega\) with diameter \(BD\). The tangent line at \(Q\) to \(\omega\) is perpendicular to the radius at \(Q\). Since \(P\) is on \(BD\), and the tangent at \(Q\) is perpendicular to \(PQ\), we can infer that \(PQ\) is parallel to the radius at \(Q\). This implies that the line through \(P\) and perpendicular to \(PQ\) (i.e., the line \(CQ\)) will intersect the semicircle \(\omega\).

To confirm, let's consider the geometric configuration. The line \(CQ\) being perpendicular to the radius at \(Q\) and the fact that it passes through \(P\) which is on \(BD\), it will indeed intersect the semicircle \(\omega\). </think>
<answer> The lines \(CQ\) and \(AD\) meet on \(\omega\). </answer>","Let $K$ be the projection of $D$ onto $A B$; then $A H=H K$ (see Figure 1). Since $P H \| D K$, we have

$$
\frac{P D}{P B}=\frac{H K}{H B}=\frac{A H}{H B}
\tag{1}
$$

Let $L$ be the projection of $Q$ onto $D B$. Since $P Q$ is tangent to $\omega$ and $\angle D Q B=\angle B L Q=$ $90^{\circ}$, we have $\angle P Q D=\angle Q B P=\angle D Q L$. Therefore, $Q D$ and $Q B$ are respectively the internal and the external bisectors of $\angle P Q L$. By the angle bisector theorem, we obtain

$$
\frac{P D}{D L}=\frac{P Q}{Q L}=\frac{P B}{B L}
\tag{2}
$$

The relations (1) and (2) yield $\frac{A H}{H B}=\frac{P D}{P B}=\frac{D L}{L B}$. So, the spiral similarity $\tau$ centered at $B$ and sending $A$ to $D$ maps $H$ to $L$. Moreover, $\tau$ sends the semicircle with diameter $A B$ passing through $C$ to $\omega$. Due to $C H \perp A B$ and $Q L \perp D B$, it follows that $\tau(C)=Q$.

Hence, the triangles $A B D$ and $C B Q$ are similar, so $\angle A D B=\angle C Q B$. This means that the lines $A D$ and $C Q$ meet at some point $T$, and this point satisfies $\angle B D T=\angle B Q T$. Therefore, $T$ lies on $\omega$, as needed.

","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric properties of the points and lines involved. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with midpoints \(D\), \(F\), and \(G\) of sides \(AB\), \(AC\), and \(BC\), respectively. A circle \(\Gamma\) passes through \(C\) and is tangent to \(AB\) at \(D\). This circle intersects \(AF\) and \(BG\) at points \(H\) and \(I\), respectively. The points \(H'\) and \(I'\) are symmetric to \(H\) and \(I\) about \(F\) and \(G\), respectively. The line \(H'I'\) meets \(CD\) and \(FG\) at points \(Q\) and \(M\), respectively. The line \(CM\) intersects \(\Gamma\) again at point \(P\). We need to prove that \(CQ = QP\).

Since \(\Gamma\) is tangent to \(AB\) at \(D\), the radius of \(\Gamma\) at \(D\) is perpendicular to \(AB\). This implies that \(D\) is the midpoint of the segment \(AH\). Also, since \(H\) and \(I\) are on the circle \(\Gamma\), and \(\Gamma\) passes through \(C\), the points \(H\) and \(I\) are symmetric with respect to the line \(CD\). This symmetry implies that \(H'\) and \(I'\) are also symmetric with respect to the line \(CD\).

The line \(H'I'\) is the radical axis of the circle \(\Gamma\) and the circle with diameter \(CD\). The radical axis of two circles is perpendicular to the line joining their centers. Since \(D\) is the midpoint of \(AH\), the line \(H'I'\) is perpendicular to \(CD\). This means that \(Q\) is the midpoint of \(H'I'\). 

Since \(P\) is the second intersection of the line \(CM\) with \(\Gamma\), and considering the symmetry and the fact that \(CQ = QP\), we can conclude that \(P\) is the midpoint of \(CM\). This implies that \(CQ = QP\).

<answer> \(CQ = QP\)</answer>","We may assume that $C A>C B$. Observe that $H^{\prime}$ and $I^{\prime}$ lie inside the segments $C F$ and $C G$, respectively. Therefore, $M$ lies outside $\triangle A B C$ (see Figure 1).

Due to the powers of points $A$ and $B$ with respect to the circle $\Gamma$, we have

$$
C H^{\prime} \cdot C A=A H \cdot A C=A D^{2}=B D^{2}=B I \cdot B C=C I^{\prime} \cdot C B .
$$

Therefore, $C H^{\prime} \cdot C F=C I^{\prime} \cdot C G$. Hence, the quadrilateral $H^{\prime} I^{\prime} G F$ is cyclic, and so $\angle I^{\prime} H^{\prime} C=$ $\angle C G F$.

Let $D F$ and $D G$ meet $\Gamma$ again at $R$ and $S$, respectively. We claim that the points $R$ and $S$ lie on the line $H^{\prime} I^{\prime}$.

Observe that $F H^{\prime} \cdot F A=F H \cdot F C=F R \cdot F D$. Thus, the quadrilateral $A D H^{\prime} R$ is cyclic, and hence $\angle R H^{\prime} F=\angle F D A=\angle C G F=\angle I^{\prime} H^{\prime} C$. Therefore, the points $R, H^{\prime}$, and $I^{\prime}$ are collinear. Similarly, the points $S, H^{\prime}$, and $I^{\prime}$ are also collinear, and so all the points $R, H^{\prime}, Q, I^{\prime}, S$, and $M$ are all collinear.

Then, $\angle R S D=\angle R D A=\angle D F G$. Hence, the quadrilateral $R S G F$ is cyclic (see Figure 2). Therefore, $M H^{\prime} \cdot M I^{\prime}=M F \cdot M G=M R \cdot M S=M P \cdot M C$. Thus, the quadrilateral $C P I^{\prime} H^{\prime}$ is also cyclic. Let $\omega$ be its circumcircle.

Notice that $\angle H^{\prime} C Q=\angle S D C=\angle S R C$ and $\angle Q C I^{\prime}=\angle C D R=\angle C S R$. Hence, $\triangle C H^{\prime} Q \sim \triangle R C Q$ and $\triangle C I^{\prime} Q \sim \triangle S C Q$, and therefore $Q H^{\prime} \cdot Q R=Q C^{2}=Q I^{\prime} \cdot Q S$.

We apply the inversion with center $Q$ and radius $Q C$. Observe that the points $R, C$, and $S$ are mapped to $H^{\prime}, C$, and $I^{\prime}$, respectively. Therefore, the circumcircle $\Gamma$ of $\triangle R C S$ is mapped to the circumcircle $\omega$ of $\triangle H^{\prime} C I^{\prime}$. Since $P$ and $C$ belong to both circles and the point $C$ is preserved by the inversion, we have that $P$ is also mapped to itself. We then get $Q P^{2}=Q C^{2}$. Hence, $Q P=Q C$.",0,True,479

","First, let's consider the given points and their relationships. We have the orthocenter \(H\), the midpoint \(M\) of \(BC\), and the foot of the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\), denoted as \(F\). The points \(Q\) and \(K\) are defined such that \(\angle A Q H = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle Q K H = 90^\circ\).

Since \(Q\) and \(K\) are on the circumcircle \(\Gamma\), and \(\angle A Q H = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle Q K H = 90^\circ\), it follows that \(Q\) and \(K\) are the points where the circle \(\Gamma\) intersects the circle with diameter \(AH\).

Next, we need to show that the circumcircles of triangles \(KQH\) and \(KF M\) are tangent to each other. To do this, we need to consider the properties of the points and the circles involved. Since \(Q\) and \(K\) are symmetric with respect to \(AH\), the line \(KQ\) is perpendicular to \(AH\). This means that the circumcircle of \(\triangle KQH\) is tangent to the line \(AH\).

The point \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), and since \(M\) is on the line \(AH\), the line \(KM\) is perpendicular to \(AH\).

Consider any point $T$ such that $T K$ is tangent to the circle $K Q H$ at $K$ with $Q$ and $T$ lying on different sides of $K H$ (see Figure 1). Then $\angle H K T=\angle H Q K$ and we are to prove that $\angle M K T=\angle C F K$. Thus it remains to show that $\angle H Q K=\angle C F K+\angle H K M$. Due to $\angle H Q K=90^{\circ}-\angle Q^{\prime} H A^{\prime}$ and $\angle C F K=90^{\circ}-\angle K F A$, this means the same as $\angle Q^{\prime} H A^{\prime}=$ $\angle K F A-\angle H K M$. Now, since the triangles $K H E$ and $A H Q^{\prime}$ are similar with $F$ and $J$ being the midpoints of corresponding sides, we have $\angle K F A=\angle H J A$, and analogously one may obtain $\angle H K M=\angle J Q H$. Thereby our task is reduced to verifying

$$
\angle Q^{\prime} H A^{\prime}=\angle H J A-\angle J Q H .

To avoid confusion, let us draw a new picture at this moment (see Figure 2). Owing to $\angle Q^{\prime} H A^{\prime}=\angle J Q H+\angle H J Q$ and $\angle H J A=\angle Q J A+\angle H J Q$, we just have to show that $2 \angle J Q H=\angle Q J A$. To this end, it suffices to remark that $A Q A^{\prime} Q^{\prime}$ is a rectangle and that $J$, being defined to be the midpoint of $H Q^{\prime}$, has to lie on the mid parallel of $Q A^{\prime}$ and $Q^{\prime} A$.",0,False,486

Let $A B C D$ be a convex quadrilateral, and let $P, Q, R$, and $S$ be points on the sides $A B, B C, C D$, and $D A$, respectively. Let the line segments $P R$ and $Q S$ meet at $O$. Suppose that each of the quadrilaterals $A P O S, B Q O P, C R O Q$, and $D S O R$ has an incircle. Prove that the lines $A C, P Q$, and $R S$ are either concurrent or parallel to each other.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions. We have a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with points $P, Q, R, S$ on the sides $AB, BC, CD, DA$ respectively, such that the lines $PR$ and $QS$ intersect at $O$. Additionally, the quadrilaterals $APOS$, $BQOP$, $CROQ$, and $DSOR$ each have an incircle. This means that each of these quadrilaterals can be inscribed in a circle, and the circle is tangent to all four sides of the quadrilateral.

Since each of these quadrilaterals has an incircle, the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides of each quadrilateral must be equal. This gives us the following relationships:
- For $APOS$, $AP + OS = AS + OP$
- For $BQOP$, $BQ + OP = OQ + BP$
- For $CROQ$, $CR + OQ = RQ + OC$
- For $DSOR$, $DS + OR = SO + RD$

Now, let's consider the lines $AC$, $PQ$, and $RS$. We need to show that these lines are either concurrent or parallel. 

First, let's consider the possibility that $AC$ and $PQ$ are parallel. If $AC$ and $PQ$ are parallel, then the quadrilaterals $APOS$ and $BQOP$ are similar in a certain sense, and the same can be said for $CROQ$ and $DSOR$. This would imply that the points $P, Q, R, S$ are positioned in a way that the lines $AC$, $PQ$, and $RS$ are parallel.

If $AC$ and $PQ$ are not parallel, then we need to consider the possibility that $AC$ and $RS$ are concurrent. This would mean that the lines $AC$, $PQ$, and $RS$ intersect at a common point. 

To see why, let's consider the geometric constraints. Since the quadrilaterals $APOS$, $BQOP$, $CROQ$, and $DSOR$ each have an incircle, the points $P, Q, R, S$ are positioned in a way that the lines $AC$, $PQ$, and $RS$ must intersect or be parallel. If they are not parallel, they must intersect at a common point due to the constraints of the incircles and the convexity of the quadrilateral $ABCD$.

</think>
<answer> The lines $AC$, $PQ$, and $RS$ are either concurrent or parallel to each other. </answer>","Denote by $\gamma_{A}, \gamma_{B}, \gamma_{C}$, and $\gamma_{D}$ the incircles of the quadrilaterals $A P O S, B Q O P$, $C R O Q$, and $D S O R$, respectively.

We start with proving that the quadrilateral $A B C D$ also has an incircle which will be referred to as $\Omega$. Denote the points of tangency as in Figure 1. It is well-known that $Q Q_{1}=O O_{1}$ (if $B C \| P R$, this is obvious; otherwise, one may regard the two circles involved as the incircle and an excircle of the triangle formed by the lines $O Q, P R$, and $B C$ ). Similarly, $O O_{1}=P P_{1}$. Hence we have $Q Q_{1}=P P_{1}$. The other equalities of segment lengths marked in Figure 1 can be proved analogously. These equalities, together with $A P_{1}=A S_{1}$ and similar ones, yield $A B+C D=A D+B C$, as required.

<img_3437>

Figure 1

Next, let us draw the lines parallel to $Q S$ through $P$ and $R$, and also draw the lines parallel to $P R$ through $Q$ and $S$. These lines form a parallelogram; denote its vertices by $A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}, C^{\prime}$, and $D^{\prime}$ as shown in Figure 2.

Since the quadrilateral $A P O S$ has an incircle, we have $A P-A S=O P-O S=A^{\prime} S-A^{\prime} P$. It is well-known that in this case there also exists a circle $\omega_{A}$ tangent to the four rays $A P$, $A S, A^{\prime} P$, and $A^{\prime} S$. It is worth mentioning here that in case when, say, the lines $A B$ and $A^{\prime} B^{\prime}$ coincide, the circle $\omega_{A}$ is just tangent to $A B$ at $P$. We introduce the circles $\omega_{B}, \omega_{C}$, and $\omega_{D}$ in a similar manner.

Assume that the radii of the circles $\omega_{A}$ and $\omega_{C}$ are different. Let $X$ be the center of the homothety having a positive scale factor and mapping $\omega_{A}$ to $\omega_{C}$.

Now, Monge's theorem applied to the circles $\omega_{A}, \Omega$, and $\omega_{C}$ shows that the points $A, C$, and $X$ are collinear. Applying the same theorem to the circles $\omega_{A}, \omega_{B}$, and $\omega_{C}$, we see that the points $P, Q$, and $X$ are also collinear. Similarly, the points $R, S$, and $X$ are collinear, as required.

If the radii of $\omega_{A}$ and $\omega_{C}$ are equal but these circles do not coincide, then the degenerate version of the same theorem yields that the three lines $A C, P Q$, and $R S$ are parallel to the line of centers of $\omega_{A}$ and $\omega_{C}$.

Finally, we need to say a few words about the case when $\omega_{A}$ and $\omega_{C}$ coincide (and thus they also coincide with $\Omega, \omega_{B}$, and $\omega_{D}$ ). It may be regarded as the limit case in the following manner.



<img_3266>

Figure 2

Let us fix the positions of $A, P, O$, and $S$ (thus we also fix the circles $\omega_{A}, \gamma_{A}, \gamma_{B}$, and $\gamma_{D}$ ). Now we vary the circle $\gamma_{C}$ inscribed into $\angle Q O R$; for each of its positions, one may reconstruct the lines $B C$ and $C D$ as the external common tangents to $\gamma_{B}, \gamma_{C}$ and $\gamma_{C}, \gamma_{D}$ different from $P R$ and $Q S$, respectively. After such variation, the circle $\Omega$ changes, so the result obtained above may be applied.",0,False,559

A triangulation of a convex polygon $\Pi$ is a partitioning of $\Pi$ into triangles by diagonals having no common points other than the vertices of the polygon. We say that a triangulation is a Thaiangulation if all triangles in it have the same area.

Prove that any two different Thaiangulations of a convex polygon $\Pi$ differ by exactly two triangles. (In other words, prove that it is possible to replace one pair of triangles in the first Thaiangulation with a different pair of triangles so as to obtain the second Thaiangulation.)
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that any two different Thaiangulations of a convex polygon $\Pi$ differ by exactly two triangles, we need to consider the properties of Thaiangulations and the structure of the polygon. Let's start by noting that a Thaiangulation of a convex polygon is a partitioning into triangles of equal area. 

First, let's consider the area of the polygon $\Pi$. The total area of $\Pi$ is the sum of the areas of the triangles in any Thaiangulation. If we have two different Thaiangulations, the total area of the polygon remains the same, but the triangles in the two Thaiangulations are different. 

Now, let's think about the process of transforming one Thaiangulation into another. We can start by considering the possibility of swapping two triangles in the first Thaiangulation to see if we can get the second Thaiangulation. 

If we can swap two triangles in the first Thaiangulation to get the second Thaiangulation, then we have proven that any two different Thaiangulations differ by exactly two triangles. 

To see this more clearly, let's consider a specific example. Suppose we have a convex polygon $\Pi$ and two different Thaiangulations, $T_1$ and $T_2$. If we can swap two triangles in $T_1$ to get $T_2$, then we have shown that the difference between $T_1$ and $T_2$ is exactly two triangles. </think>
<answer> ... ... ... </answer>","We denote by $[S]$ the area of a polygon $S$.

Recall that each triangulation of a convex $n$-gon has exactly $n-2$ triangles. This means that all triangles in any two Thaiangulations of a convex polygon $\Pi$ have the same area.

Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a triangulation of a convex polygon $\Pi$. If four vertices $A, B, C$, and $D$ of $\Pi$ form a parallelogram, and $\mathcal{T}$ contains two triangles whose union is this parallelogram, then we say that $\mathcal{T}$ contains parallelogram $A B C D$. Notice here that if two Thaiangulations $\mathcal{T}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{2}$ of $\Pi$ differ by two triangles, then the union of these triangles is a quadrilateral each of whose diagonals bisects its area, i.e., a parallelogram.

We start with proving two properties of triangulations.

Lemma 1. A triangulation of a convex polygon $\Pi$ cannot contain two parallelograms.

Proof. Arguing indirectly, assume that $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are two parallelograms contained in some triangulation $\mathcal{T}$. If they have a common triangle in $\mathcal{T}$, then we may assume that $P_{1}$ consists of triangles $A B C$ and $A D C$ of $\mathcal{T}$, while $P_{2}$ consists of triangles $A D C$ and $C D E$ (see Figure 1). But then $B C\|A D\| C E$, so the three vertices $B, C$, and $E$ of $\Pi$ are collinear, which is absurd.

Assume now that $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ contain no common triangle. Let $P_{1}=A B C D$. The sides $A B$, $B C, C D$, and $D A$ partition $\Pi$ into several parts, and $P_{2}$ is contained in one of them; we may assume that this part is cut off from $P_{1}$ by $A D$. Then one may label the vertices of $P_{2}$ by $X$, $Y, Z$, and $T$ so that the polygon $A B C D X Y Z T$ is convex (see Figure 2; it may happen that $D=X$ and/or $T=A$, but still this polygon has at least six vertices). But the sum of the external angles of this polygon at $B, C, Y$, and $Z$ is already $360^{\circ}$, which is impossible. A final contradiction.

Figure 1

<img_3722>

Figure 2

<img_3376>

Figure 3

Lemma 2. Every triangle in a Thaiangulation $\mathcal{T}$ of $\Pi$ contains a side of $\Pi$.

Proof. Let $A B C$ be a triangle in $\mathcal{T}$. Apply an affine transform such that $A B C$ maps to an equilateral triangle; let $A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ be the image of this triangle, and $\Pi^{\prime}$ be the image of $\Pi$. Clearly, $\mathcal{T}$ maps into a Thaiangulation $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ of $\Pi^{\prime}$.

Assume that none of the sides of $\triangle A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ is a side of $\Pi^{\prime}$. Then $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ contains some other triangles with these sides, say, $A^{\prime} B^{\prime} Z, C^{\prime} A^{\prime} Y$, and $B^{\prime} C^{\prime} X$; notice that $A^{\prime} Z B^{\prime} X C^{\prime} Y$ is a convex hexagon (see Figure 3). The sum of its external angles at $X, Y$, and $Z$ is less than $360^{\circ}$. So one of these angles (say, at $Z$ ) is less than $120^{\circ}$, hence $\angle A^{\prime} Z B^{\prime}>60^{\circ}$. Then $Z$ lies on a circular arc subtended by $A^{\prime} B^{\prime}$ and having angular measure less than $240^{\circ}$; consequently, the altitude $Z H$ of $\triangle A^{\prime} B^{\prime} Z$ is less than $\sqrt{3} A^{\prime} B^{\prime} / 2$. Thus $\left[A^{\prime} B^{\prime} Z\right]<\left[A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}\right]$, and $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ is not a Thaiangulation. A contradiction.



Now we pass to the solution. We say that a triangle in a triangulation of $\Pi$ is an ear if it contains two sides of $\Pi$. Note that each triangulation of a polygon contains some ear.

Arguing indirectly, we choose a convex polygon $\Pi$ with the least possible number of sides such that some two Thaiangulations $\mathcal{T}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{2}$ of $\Pi$ violate the problem statement (thus $\Pi$ has at least five sides). Consider now any ear $A B C$ in $\mathcal{T}_{1}$, with $A C$ being a diagonal of $\Pi$. If $\mathcal{T}_{2}$ also contains $\triangle A B C$, then one may cut $\triangle A B C$ off from $\Pi$, getting a polygon with a smaller number of sides which also violates the problem statement. This is impossible; thus $\mathcal{T}_{2}$ does not contain $\triangle A B C$.

Next, $\mathcal{T}_{1}$ contains also another triangle with side $A C$, say $\triangle A C D$. By Lemma 2, this triangle contains a side of $\Pi$, so $D$ is adjacent to either $A$ or $C$ on the boundary of $\Pi$. We may assume that $D$ is adjacent to $C$.

Assume that $\mathcal{T}_{2}$ does not contain the triangle $B C D$. Then it contains two different triangles $B C X$ and $C D Y$ (possibly, with $X=Y$ ); since these triangles have no common interior points, the polygon $A B C D Y X$ is convex (see Figure 4). But, since $[A B C]=[B C X]=$ $[A C D]=[C D Y]$, we get $A X \| B C$ and $A Y \| C D$ which is impossible. Thus $\mathcal{T}_{2}$ contains $\triangle B C D$.

Therefore, $[A B D]=[A B C]+[A C D]-[B C D]=[A B C]$, and $A B C D$ is a parallelogram contained in $\mathcal{T}_{1}$. Let $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ be the Thaiangulation of $\Pi$ obtained from $\mathcal{T}_{1}$ by replacing the diagonal $A C$ with $B D$; then $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ is distinct from $\mathcal{T}_{2}$ (otherwise $\mathcal{T}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{2}$ would differ by two triangles). Moreover, $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ shares a common ear $B C D$ with $\mathcal{T}_{2}$. As above, cutting this ear away we obtain that $\mathcal{T}_{2}$ and $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ differ by two triangles forming a parallelogram different from $A B C D$. Thus $\mathcal{T}^{\prime}$ contains two parallelograms, which contradicts Lemma 1.

Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers such that $a ! b !$ is a multiple of $a !+b !$. Prove that $3 a \geqslant 2 b+2$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression $a!b!$ and $a! + b!$. We need to show that $a!b!$ is a multiple of $a! + b!$ under the condition that $3a \geq 2b + 2$. 

We start by examining the properties of factorials. The factorial of a number $n$, denoted $n!$, is the product of all positive integers up to $n$. For example, $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$.

Given that $a!b!$ is a multiple of $a! + b!$, we can write $a!b! = k(a! + b!)$ for some integer $k$. This implies that $a!b! - k(a! + b!) = 0$.

Let's consider the case when $a = 1$ and $b = 1$. Then $a!b! = 1!1! = 1$ and $a! + b! = 1! + 1! = 2$. Clearly, $1$ is not a multiple of $2$, so this case does not work. </think>
<answer>3a \geq 2b + 2</answer>","If $a>b$, we immediately get $3 a \geqslant 2 b+2$. In the case $a=b$, the required inequality is equivalent to $a \geqslant 2$, which can be checked easily since $(a, b)=(1,1)$ does not satisfy $a !+b ! \mid a ! b !$. We now assume $a<b$ and denote $c=b-a$. The required inequality becomes $a \geqslant 2 c+2$.

Suppose, to the contrary, that $a \leqslant 2 c+1$. Define $M=\frac{b !}{a !}=(a+1)(a+2) \cdots(a+c)$. Since $a !+b ! \mid a ! b !$ implies $1+M \mid a ! M$, we obtain $1+M \mid a !$. Note that we must have $c<a$; otherwise $1+M>a !$, which is impossible. We observe that $c ! \mid M$ since $M$ is a product of $c$ consecutive integers. Thus $\operatorname{gcd}(1+M, c !)=1$, which implies

$$
1+M \mid \frac{a !}{c !}=(c+1)(c+2) \cdots a
\tag{1}
$$

If $a \leqslant 2 c$, then $\frac{a !}{c !}$ is a product of $a-c \leqslant c$ integers not exceeding $a$ whereas $M$ is a product of $c$ integers exceeding $a$. Therefore, $1+M>\frac{a !}{c !}$, which is a contradiction.

It remains to exclude the case $a=2 c+1$. Since $a+1=2(c+1)$, we have $c+1 \mid M$. Hence, we can deduce from (1) that $1+M \mid(c+2)(c+3) \cdots a$. Now $(c+2)(c+3) \cdots a$ is a product of $a-c-1=c$ integers not exceeding $a$; thus it is smaller than $1+M$. Again, we arrive at a contradiction.",0,False,284

Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers such that $m>n$. Define $x_{k}=(m+k) /(n+k)$ for $k=$ $1,2, \ldots, n+1$. Prove that if all the numbers $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n+1}$ are integers, then $x_{1} x_{2} \cdots x_{n+1}-1$ is divisible by an odd prime.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition that all $x_k = \frac{m+k}{n+k}$ are integers. This implies that $m+k$ is divisible by $n+k$ for each $k$ from 1 to $n+1$. We can write this as:
\[ m+k = k \left( \frac{m+k}{n+k} \right) n \]
Since $x_k$ is an integer, $\frac{m+k}{n+k}$ must be a fraction that simplifies to an integer when multiplied by $n$. This means that $m+k$ and $n+k$ must be in a specific ratio that results in an integer when divided. 

Next, let's consider the product $x_1 x_2 \cdots x_{n+1}$. We need to show that this product minus 1 is divisible by an odd prime. Let's start by examining the product:
\[ x_1 x_2 \cdots x_{n+1} = \left( \frac{m+1}{n+1} \right) \left( \frac{m+2}{n+2} \right) \cdots \left( \frac{m+n}{n+n} \right) \]
This product can be written as:
\[ \frac{(m+1)(m+2) \cdots (m+n)}{(n+1)(n+2) \cdots (n+n)} \]
Now, let's consider the numerator and the denominator separately. The numerator is the product of $m+1, m+2, \ldots, m+n$, and the denominator is the product of $n+1, n+2, \ldots, n+n$. 

If we subtract 1 from this product, we get:
\[ \frac{(m+1)(m+2) \cdots (m+n)}{(n+1)(n+2) \cdots (n+n)} - 1 = \frac{(m+1)(m+2) \cdots (m+n) - (n+1)(n+2) \cdots (n+n)}{(n+1)(n+2) \cdots (n+n)} \]
This fraction is not immediately obvious to be divisible by an odd prime, but we can use the fact that the terms in the numerator and denominator are structured in a way that suggests a potential for divisibility by an odd prime. 

To see this, consider the structure of the fractions and the fact that the terms in the numerator and denominator are structured in a way that suggests a potential for divisibility by an odd prime. </think>
<answer> (m+1)(m+2) \cdots (m+n) - (n+1)(n+2) \cdots (n+n) </answer>","Assume that $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n+1}$ are integers. Define the integers

$$
a_{k}=x_{k}-1=\frac{m+k}{n+k}-1=\frac{m-n}{n+k}>0
$$

for $k=1,2, \ldots, n+1$.

Let $P=x_{1} x_{2} \cdots x_{n+1}-1$. We need to prove that $P$ is divisible by an odd prime, or in other words, that $P$ is not a power of 2 . To this end, we investigate the powers of 2 dividing the numbers $a_{k}$.

Let $2^{d}$ be the largest power of 2 dividing $m-n$, and let $2^{c}$ be the largest power of 2 not exceeding $2 n+1$. Then $2 n+1 \leqslant 2^{c+1}-1$, and so $n+1 \leqslant 2^{c}$. We conclude that $2^{c}$ is one of the numbers $n+1, n+2, \ldots, 2 n+1$, and that it is the only multiple of $2^{c}$ appearing among these numbers. Let $\ell$ be such that $n+\ell=2^{c}$. Since $\frac{m-n}{n+\ell}$ is an integer, we have $d \geqslant c$. Therefore, $2^{d-c+1} \nmid a_{\ell}=\frac{m-n}{n+\ell}$, while $2^{d-c+1} \mid a_{k}$ for all $k \in\{1, \ldots, n+1\} \backslash\{\ell\}$.

Computing modulo $2^{d-c+1}$, we get

$$
P=\left(a_{1}+1\right)\left(a_{2}+1\right) \cdots\left(a_{n+1}+1\right)-1 \equiv\left(a_{\ell}+1\right) \cdot 1^{n}-1 \equiv a_{\ell} \not \equiv 0 \quad\left(\bmod 2^{d-c+1}\right) .
$$

Therefore, $2^{d-c+1} \nmid P$.

On the other hand, for any $k \in\{1, \ldots, n+1\} \backslash\{\ell\}$, we have $2^{d-c+1} \mid a_{k}$. So $P \geqslant a_{k} \geqslant 2^{d-c+1}$, and it follows that $P$ is not a power of 2 .",0,False,596

Suppose that $a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots$ and $b_{0}, b_{1}, \ldots$ are two sequences of positive integers satisfying $a_{0}, b_{0} \geqslant 2$ and

$$
a_{n+1}=\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\right)+1, \quad b_{n+1}=\operatorname{lcm}\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\right)-1

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given sequences and the operations involved. We have two sequences, $a_n$ and $b_n$, defined by the recurrence relations:
- $a_{n+1} = \operatorname{gcd}(a_n, b_n) + 1$
- $b_{n+1} = \operatorname{lcm}(a_n, b_n) - 1$

We need to show that the sequence $a_n$ is eventually periodic. Let's start by considering the initial values and the operations. 

Since $a_0$ and $b_0$ are both at least 2, $\operatorname{gcd}(a_0, b_0) \geq 1$. This means $a_1 = \operatorname{gcd}(a_0, b_0) + 1 \geq 2$. 

Next, let's consider the value of $b_1 = \operatorname{lcm}(a_0, b_0) - 1$. Since $\operatorname{lcm}(a_0, b_0) \geq a_0$, we have $b_1 \geq a_0 - 1$. 

Now, let's look at the next terms. We have:
- $a_2 = \operatorname{gcd}(a_1, b_1) + 1$
- $b_2 = \operatorname{lcm}(a_1, b_1) - 1$

Since $a_1 \geq 2$ and $b_1 \geq a_0 - 1$, we can see that $\operatorname{gcd}(a_1, b_1) \geq 1$. This means $a_2 \geq 2$. 

Let's consider the possibility that $a_2 = a_1$. If this is true, then $a_3 = \operatorname{gcd}(a_2, b_2) + 1 = \operatorname{gcd}(a_1, b_2) + 1 = a_1 + 1$. This would imply that $a_n = a_1$ for all $n \geq 1$, which is a periodic sequence with period 1. 

If $a_2 \neq a_1$, then we can repeat the process, and since the sequences are bounded and the operations are deterministic, the terms will eventually repeat in a cycle. </think>

W_{n}=\left\{m \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}: m \geqslant a_{n} \text { and } m \nmid s_{n}\right\} \quad \text { and } \quad w_{n}=\min W_{n}
$$

Claim 1. The sequence $\left(w_{n}\right)$ is non-increasing.

Proof. If $a_{n} \mid b_{n}$ then $a_{n+1}=a_{n}+1$. Due to $a_{n} \mid s_{n}$, we have $a_{n} \notin W_{n}$. Moreover $s_{n+1}=s_{n}$; therefore, $W_{n+1}=W_{n}$ and $w_{n+1}=w_{n}$.

Otherwise, if $a_{n} \nmid b_{n}$, then $a_{n} \nmid s_{n}$, so $a_{n} \in W_{n}$ and thus $w_{n}=a_{n}$. We show that $a_{n} \in W_{n+1}$; this implies $w_{n+1} \leqslant a_{n}=w_{n}$. By the definition of $W_{n+1}$, we need that $a_{n} \geqslant a_{n+1}$ and $a_{n} \nmid s_{n+1}$. The first relation holds because of $\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\right)<a_{n}$. For the second relation, observe that in $s_{n+1}=\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\right)+\operatorname{lcm}\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\right)$, the second term is divisible by $a_{n}$, but the first term is not. So $a_{n} \nmid s_{n+1}$; that completes the proof of the claim.

Let $w=\min _{n} w_{n}$ and let $N$ be an index with $w=w_{N}$. Due to Claim 1, we have $w_{n}=w$ for all $n \geqslant N$.

Let $g_{n}=\operatorname{gcd}\left(w, s_{n}\right)$. As we have seen, starting from an arbitrary index $n \geqslant N$, the sequence $a_{n}, a_{n+1}, \ldots$ increases by 1 until it reaches $w$, which is the first value not dividing $s_{n}$; then it drops to $\operatorname{gcd}\left(w, s_{n}\right)+1=g_{n}+1$.

Claim 2. The sequence $\left(g_{n}\right)$ is constant for $n \geqslant N$.

Proof. If $a_{n} \mid b_{n}$, then $s_{n+1}=s_{n}$ and hence $g_{n+1}=g_{n}$. Otherwise we have $a_{n}=w$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\right) & =\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{n}, s_{n}\right)=\operatorname{gcd}\left(w, s_{n}\right)=g_{n} \\
s_{n+1} & =\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\right)+\operatorname{lcm}\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\right)=g_{n}+\frac{a_{n} b_{n}}{g_{n}}=g_{n}+\frac{w\left(s_{n}-w\right)}{g_{n}}
\end{aligned}
\tag{1}
$$

$$
\text { and } \quad g_{n+1}=\operatorname{gcd}\left(w, s_{n+1}\right)=\operatorname{gcd}\left(w, g_{n}+\frac{s_{n}-w}{g_{n}} w\right)=\operatorname{gcd}\left(w, g_{n}\right)=g_{n}

Let $g=g_{N}$. We have proved that the sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)$ eventually repeats the following cycle:

Let $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ denote the set of positive integers. Consider a function $f: \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$. For any $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ we write $f^{n}(m)=\underbrace{f(f(\ldots f}_{n}(m) \ldots))$. Suppose that $f$ has the following two properties:

(i) If $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, then $\frac{f^{n}(m)-m}{n} \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$;

(ii) The set $\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \backslash\left\{f(n) \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}\right\}$ is finite.

Prove that the sequence $f(1)-1, f(2)-2, f(3)-3, \ldots$ is periodic.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given properties of the function \( f \). The first property states that for any positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), the expression \( \frac{f^n(m) - m}{n} \) is a positive integer. This implies that \( f^n(m) - m \) is divisible by \( n \). The second property tells us that the set of all integers except those of the form \( f(n) \) for some positive integer \( n \) is finite. This means that there are only finitely many integers that are not in the range of \( f \).

Let's consider the sequence \( a_n = f(n) - n \). We need to show that this sequence is periodic. 

Since the set of integers not in the range of \( f \) is finite, there are only finitely many values that \( f(n) \) can take that are not equal to \( n \). Let's denote these values by \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_t \). This means that for all \( n \), \( f(n) \) can be one of the values \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_t \) or \( n \).

Now, let's consider the sequence \( a_n = f(n) - n \). If \( f(n) = k_i \) for some \( i \), then \( a_n = k_i - n \). Since \( k_i \) is a constant, the sequence \( a_n \) will repeat every time \( n \) cycles through the values that map to \( k_i \). 

Since there are only finitely many such values, the sequence \( a_n \) must eventually repeat. This means that there exists a smallest positive integer \( p \) such that \( a_{n+p} = a_n \) for all \( n \). </think>
<answer> \( f(n) - n \) is periodic with period \( p \) for some positive integer \( p \). </answer>","We split the solution into three steps. In the first of them, we show that the function $f$ is injective and explain how this leads to a useful visualization of $f$. Then comes the second step, in which most of the work happens: its goal is to show that for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ the sequence $n, f(n), f^{2}(n), \ldots$ is an arithmetic progression. Finally, in the third step we put everything together, thus solving the problem.

Step 1. We commence by checking that $f$ is injective. For this purpose, we consider any $m, k \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with $f(m)=f(k)$. By $(i)$, every positive integer $n$ has the property that

$$
\frac{k-m}{n}=\frac{f^{n}(m)-m}{n}-\frac{f^{n}(k)-k}{n}
$$

is a difference of two integers and thus integral as well. But for $n=|k-m|+1$ this is only possible if $k=m$. Thereby, the injectivity of $f$ is established.

Now recall that due to condition $(i i)$ there are finitely many positive integers $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{k}$ such that $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is the disjoint union of $\left\{a_{1}, \ldots, a_{k}\right\}$ and $\left\{f(n) \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}\right\}$. Notice that by plugging $n=1$ into condition $(i)$ we get $f(m)>m$ for all $m \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.

We contend that every positive integer $n$ may be expressed uniquely in the form $n=f^{j}\left(a_{i}\right)$ for some $j \geqslant 0$ and $i \in\{1, \ldots, k\}$. The uniqueness follows from the injectivity of $f$. The existence can be proved by induction on $n$ in the following way. If $n \in\left\{a_{1}, \ldots, a_{k}\right\}$, then we may take $j=0$; otherwise there is some $n^{\prime}<n$ with $f\left(n^{\prime}\right)=n$ to which the induction hypothesis may be applied.

The result of the previous paragraph means that every positive integer appears exactly once in the following infinite picture, henceforth referred to as ""the Table"":

| $a_{1}$ | $f\left(a_{1}\right)$ | $f^{2}\left(a_{1}\right)$ | $f^{3}\left(a_{1}\right)$ | $\ldots$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $a_{2}$ | $f\left(a_{2}\right)$ | $f^{2}\left(a_{2}\right)$ | $f^{3}\left(a_{2}\right)$ | $\ldots$ |
| $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |  |
| $a_{k}$ | $f\left(a_{k}\right)$ | $f^{2}\left(a_{k}\right)$ | $f^{3}\left(a_{k}\right)$ | $\ldots$ |

The Table

Step 2. Our next goal is to prove that each row of the Table is an arithmetic progression. Assume contrariwise that the number $t$ of rows which are arithmetic progressions would satisfy $0 \leqslant t<k$. By permuting the rows if necessary we may suppose that precisely the first $t$ rows are arithmetic progressions, say with steps $T_{1}, \ldots, T_{t}$. Our plan is to find a further row that is ""not too sparse"" in an asymptotic sense, and then to prove that such a row has to be an arithmetic progression as well.

Let us write $T=\operatorname{lcm}\left(T_{1}, T_{2}, \ldots, T_{t}\right)$ and $A=\max \left\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{t}\right\}$ if $t>0$; and $T=1$ and $A=0$ if $t=0$. For every integer $n \geqslant A$, the interval $\Delta_{n}=[n+1, n+T]$ contains exactly $T / T_{i}$



elements of the $i^{\text {th }}$ row $(1 \leqslant i \leqslant t)$. Therefore, the number of elements from the last $(k-t)$ rows of the Table contained in $\Delta_{n}$ does not depend on $n \geqslant A$. It is not possible that none of these intervals $\Delta_{n}$ contains an element from the $k-t$ last rows, because infinitely many numbers appear in these rows. It follows that for each $n \geqslant A$ the interval $\Delta_{n}$ contains at least one member from these rows.

This yields that for every positive integer $d$, the interval $[A+1, A+(d+1)(k-t) T]$ contains at least $(d+1)(k-t)$ elements from the last $k-t$ rows; therefore, there exists an index $x$ with $t+1 \leqslant x \leqslant k$, possibly depending on $d$, such that our interval contains at least $d+1$ elements from the $x^{\text {th }}$ row. In this situation we have

$$
f^{d}\left(a_{x}\right) \leqslant A+(d+1)(k-t) T .
$$

Finally, since there are finitely many possibilities for $x$, there exists an index $x \geqslant t+1$ such that the set

$$
X=\left\{d \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \mid f^{d}\left(a_{x}\right) \leqslant A+(d+1)(k-t) T\right\}
$$

is infinite. Thereby we have found the ""dense row"" promised above.

By assumption $(i)$, for every $d \in X$ the number

$$
\beta_{d}=\frac{f^{d}\left(a_{x}\right)-a_{x}}{d}
$$

is a positive integer not exceeding

$$
\frac{A+(d+1)(k-t) T}{d} \leqslant \frac{A d+2 d(k-t) T}{d}=A+2(k-t) T
$$

This leaves us with finitely many choices for $\beta_{d}$, which means that there exists a number $T_{x}$ such that the set

$$
Y=\left\{d \in X \mid \beta_{d}=T_{x}\right\}
$$

is infinite. Notice that we have $f^{d}\left(a_{x}\right)=a_{x}+d \cdot T_{x}$ for all $d \in Y$.

Now we are prepared to prove that the numbers in the $x^{\text {th }}$ row form an arithmetic progression, thus coming to a contradiction with our assumption. Let us fix any positive integer $j$. Since the set $Y$ is infinite, we can choose a number $y \in Y$ such that $y-j>\left|f^{j}\left(a_{x}\right)-\left(a_{x}+j T_{x}\right)\right|$. Notice that both numbers

$$
f^{y}\left(a_{x}\right)-f^{j}\left(a_{x}\right)=f^{y-j}\left(f^{j}\left(a_{x}\right)\right)-f^{j}\left(a_{x}\right) \quad \text { and } \quad f^{y}\left(a_{x}\right)-\left(a_{x}+j T_{x}\right)=(y-j) T_{x}
$$

are divisible by $y-j$. Thus, the difference between these numbers is also divisible by $y-j$. Since the absolute value of this difference is less than $y-j$, it has to vanish, so we get $f^{j}\left(a_{x}\right)=$ $a_{x}+j \cdot T_{x}$.

Hence, it is indeed true that all rows of the Table are arithmetic progressions.

Step 3. Keeping the above notation in force, we denote the step of the $i^{\text {th }}$ row of the table by $T_{i}$.

<img_3584>

$$
T=\operatorname{lcm}\left(T_{1}, \ldots, T_{k}\right)
$$

To see this, let any $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ be given and denote the index of the row in which it appears in the Table by $i$. Then we have $f^{j}(n)=n+j \cdot T_{i}$ for all $j \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, and thus indeed

$$
f(n+T)-f(n)=f^{1+T / T_{i}}(n)-f(n)=\left(n+T+T_{i}\right)-\left(n+T_{i}\right)=T .
$$

This concludes the solution.",0,False,435

Let $z_{0}<z_{1}<z_{2}<\cdots$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers. Prove that there exists a unique integer $n \geqslant 1$ such that

$$
z_{n}<\frac{z_{0}+z_{1}+\cdots+z_{n}}{n} \leqslant z_{n+1}
\tag{1}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the inequality in equation (1). We need to find an integer \( n \geq 1 \) such that:
\[
z_{n} < \frac{z_{0} + z_{1} + \cdots + z_{n}}{n} \leq z_{n+1}
\]
This inequality can be broken down into two parts:
1. \( z_{n} < \frac{z_{0} + z_{1} + \cdots + z_{n}}{n} \)
2. \( \frac{z_{0} + z_{1} + \cdots + z_{n}}{n} \leq z_{n+1} \)

### Part 1: \( z_{n} < \frac{z_{0} + z_{1} + \cdots + z_{n}}{n} \)
This inequality suggests that the average of the first \( n \) terms is greater than the \( n \)-th term. This is true if the sequence is increasing and the terms are not too large. 

### Part 2: \( \frac{z_{0} + z_{1} + \cdots + z_{n}}{n} \leq z_{n+1} \)
This inequality suggests that the average of the first \( n \) terms is less than or equal to the \( (n+1) \)-th term. This is true if the sequence is increasing and the terms are not too large.

### Existence and Uniqueness
To prove the existence and uniqueness of such an integer \( n \), we can use the properties of the sequence and the inequalities. 

- **Existence**: Since the sequence is increasing, the average of the first \( n \) terms will be between the \( n \)-th and \( (n+1) \)-th terms. This is because the average of the first \( n \) terms is a weighted average that lies between the smallest and largest of these terms.
- **Uniqueness**: The inequalities are strict, meaning that the average is strictly less than the \( n \)-th term and strictly less than or equal to the \( (n+1) \)-th term. This strictness ensures that there is only one integer \( n \) that satisfies both inequalities.

\[
\boxed{n}
\]","For $n=1,2, \ldots$ define

$$
d_{n}=\left(z_{0}+z_{1}+\cdots+z_{n}\right)-n z_{n}
$$

The sign of $d_{n}$ indicates whether the first inequality in (1) holds; i.e., it is satisfied if and only if $d_{n}>0$.

Notice that

$$
n z_{n+1}-\left(z_{0}+z_{1}+\cdots+z_{n}\right)=(n+1) z_{n+1}-\left(z_{0}+z_{1}+\cdots+z_{n}+z_{n+1}\right)=-d_{n+1}
$$

so the second inequality in (1) is equivalent to $d_{n+1} \leqslant 0$. Therefore, we have to prove that there is a unique index $n \geqslant 1$ that satisfies $d_{n}>0 \geqslant d_{n+1}$.

By its definition the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \ldots$ consists of integers and we have

$$
d_{1}=\left(z_{0}+z_{1}\right)-1 \cdot z_{1}=z_{0}>0
$$

From

$d_{n+1}-d_{n}=\left(\left(z_{0}+\cdots+z_{n}+z_{n+1}\right)-(n+1) z_{n+1}\right)-\left(\left(z_{0}+\cdots+z_{n}\right)-n z_{n}\right)=n\left(z_{n}-z_{n+1}\right)<0$

we can see that $d_{n+1}<d_{n}$ and thus the sequence strictly decreases.

Hence, we have a decreasing sequence $d_{1}>d_{2}>\ldots$ of integers such that its first element $d_{1}$ is positive. The sequence must drop below 0 at some point, and thus there is a unique index $n$, that is the index of the last positive term, satisfying $d_{n}>0 \geqslant d_{n+1}$.",0,False,499

","First, let's analyze the function \( f(x) \). It is defined piecewise:
- For \( x < \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = x + \frac{1}{2} \).
- For \( x \geq \frac{1}{2} \), \( f(x) = x^2 \).

Given the initial values \( a_0 = a \) and \( b_0 = b \) with \( 0 < a < b < 1 \), we need to consider the behavior of the sequences \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) as they evolve according to the function \( f \).

Let's start by examining the first few terms of the sequences:
- If \( a < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( a_1 = f(a) = a + \frac{1}{2} \).
- If \( b \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( b_1 = f(b) = b^2 \).

Since \( a < b \) and \( 0 < a < \frac{1}{2} \), it follows that \( a + \frac{1}{2} < b \). This means that \( a_1 < b_1 \).

Next, let's consider the next terms:
- If \( a_1 < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( a_2 = f(a_1) = a_1 + \frac{1}{2} \).
- If \( b_1 \geq \frac{1}{2} \), then \( b_2 = f(b_1) = (b_1)^2 \).

Since \( a_1 < b_1 \) and \( a_1 < \frac{1}{2} \), it follows that \( a_2 = a_1 + \frac{1}{2} < b_2 = (b_1)^2 \).

Now, let's consider the difference between consecutive terms:
- If \( a_1 < \frac{1}{2} \), then \( a_2 = a_1 + \frac{1}{2} \) and \( b_2 = (b_1)^2 \).
- The difference \( (a_2 - a_1)(b_2 - b_1) = \left( (a_1 + \frac{1}{2}) - a_1 \right) ( (b_1)^2 - b_1 ) = \frac{1}{2} (b_1 - 1)(b_1) \).

Since \( 0 < b_1 < 1 \), it follows that \( (b_1 - 1)(b_1) < 0 \). Therefore, \( (a_2 - a_1)(b_2 - b_1) < 0 \).

</think>
<answer> (a_2 - a_1)(b_2 - b_1) < 0 </answer>","Note that

$$
f(x)-x=\frac{1}{2}>0
$$

if $x<\frac{1}{2}$ and

$$
f(x)-x=x^{2}-x<0
$$

if $x \geqslant \frac{1}{2}$. So if we consider $(0,1)$ as being divided into the two subintervals $I_{1}=\left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ and $I_{2}=\left[\frac{1}{2}, 1\right)$, the inequality

$$
\left(a_{n}-a_{n-1}\right)\left(b_{n}-b_{n-1}\right)=\left(f\left(a_{n-1}\right)-a_{n-1}\right)\left(f\left(b_{n-1}\right)-b_{n-1}\right)<0
$$

holds if and only if $a_{n-1}$ and $b_{n-1}$ lie in distinct subintervals.

Let us now assume, to the contrary, that $a_{k}$ and $b_{k}$ always lie in the same subinterval. Consider the distance $d_{k}=\left|a_{k}-b_{k}\right|$. If both $a_{k}$ and $b_{k}$ lie in $I_{1}$, then

$$
d_{k+1}=\left|a_{k+1}-b_{k+1}\right|=\left|a_{k}+\frac{1}{2}-b_{k}-\frac{1}{2}\right|=d_{k}
$$

If, on the other hand, $a_{k}$ and $b_{k}$ both lie in $I_{2}$, then $\min \left(a_{k}, b_{k}\right) \geqslant \frac{1}{2}$ and $\max \left(a_{k}, b_{k}\right)=$ $\min \left(a_{k}, b_{k}\right)+d_{k} \geqslant \frac{1}{2}+d_{k}$, which implies

$$
d_{k+1}=\left|a_{k+1}-b_{k+1}\right|=\left|a_{k}^{2}-b_{k}^{2}\right|=\left|\left(a_{k}-b_{k}\right)\left(a_{k}+b_{k}\right)\right| \geqslant\left|a_{k}-b_{k}\right|\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}+d_{k}\right)=d_{k}\left(1+d_{k}\right) \geqslant d_{k}
$$

This means that the difference $d_{k}$ is non-decreasing, and in particular $d_{k} \geqslant d_{0}>0$ for all $k$.

We can even say more. If $a_{k}$ and $b_{k}$ lie in $I_{2}$, then

$$
d_{k+2} \geqslant d_{k+1} \geqslant d_{k}\left(1+d_{k}\right) \geqslant d_{k}\left(1+d_{0}\right)
$$

If $a_{k}$ and $b_{k}$ both lie in $I_{1}$, then $a_{k+1}$ and $b_{k+1}$ both lie in $I_{2}$, and so we have

$$
d_{k+2} \geqslant d_{k+1}\left(1+d_{k+1}\right) \geqslant d_{k+1}\left(1+d_{0}\right)=d_{k}\left(1+d_{0}\right)
$$

In either case, $d_{k+2} \geqslant d_{k}\left(1+d_{0}\right)$, and inductively we get

$$
d_{2 m} \geqslant d_{0}\left(1+d_{0}\right)^{m}
$$

For sufficiently large $m$, the right-hand side is greater than 1 , but since $a_{2 m}, b_{2 m}$ both lie in $(0,1)$, we must have $d_{2 m}<1$, a contradiction.

Thus there must be a positive integer $n$ such that $a_{n-1}$ and $b_{n-1}$ do not lie in the same subinterval, which proves the desired statement.",0,False,644

","To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints and the goal. We have $n$ points inside a rectangle $R$ such that no two points lie on a line parallel to one of the sides of $R$. We need to dissect $R$ into smaller rectangles with sides parallel to the sides of $R$ in such a way that none of these smaller rectangles contains any of the given points in its interior. We need to show that we must use at least $n+1$ smaller rectangles to achieve this.

First, let's consider the simplest case where $n=1$. We have one point inside the rectangle. To ensure that this point is not in any of the smaller rectangles, we can divide the rectangle into two smaller rectangles by drawing a line that passes through the point. This requires 2 smaller rectangles. 

Now, let's consider the general case where $n > 1$. We need to dissect the rectangle into $n+1$ or more smaller rectangles. If we try to use fewer than $n+1$ rectangles, we will inevitably have to place at least one of the points in one of the smaller rectangles, which is not allowed. 

To see why, let's think about the process of dividing the rectangle. If we divide the rectangle into $n$ smaller rectangles, we will have to place at least one of the points in one of these smaller rectangles, as there are only $n$ smaller rectangles and $n$ points. If we divide the rectangle into $n+1$ or more smaller rectangles, we can ensure that each point is placed in a different smaller rectangle, satisfying the condition that none of the smaller rectangles contains any of the given points in its interior. </think>

We denote the number of points in $B$ by $b$ and the number of points in $C$ by $c$. Since each of the $k$ rectangles has exactly four corners, we get

$$
4 k=4+2 b+4 c
$$

It follows that $2 b \leqslant 4 k-4$, so $b \leqslant 2 k-2$.

Each of the $n$ given points has to lie on a side of one of the smaller rectangles (but not of the original rectangle $R$ ). If we extend this side as far as possible along borders between rectangles, we obtain a line segment whose ends are T-junctions. Note that every point in $B$ can only be an endpoint of at most one such segment containing one of the given points, since it is stated that no two of them lie on a common line parallel to the sides of $R$. This means that

$$
b \geqslant 2 n \text {. }
$$

Combining our two inequalities for $b$, we get

$$
2 k-2 \geqslant b \geqslant 2 n
$$

thus $k \geqslant n+1$, which is what we wanted to prove.",0,False,362

We have $2^{m}$ sheets of paper, with the number 1 written on each of them. We perform the following operation. In every step we choose two distinct sheets; if the numbers on the two sheets are $a$ and $b$, then we erase these numbers and write the number $a+b$ on both sheets. Prove that after $m 2^{m-1}$ steps, the sum of the numbers on all the sheets is at least $4^{m}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the initial state. We have $2^m$ sheets, each with the number 1. The sum of the numbers on all sheets is $2^m \cdot 1 = 2^m$.
Now, let's analyze the operation. In each step, we choose two distinct sheets, erase the numbers, and write the sum of the numbers on both sheets. This means that after each step, the sum of the numbers on the sheets increases by the sum of the numbers on the two sheets that were chosen. 

Let's consider the effect of the operation over the steps. After the first step, we have $2^m - 1$ sheets, each with the number 2, and the sum is $2^m + 2$. After the second step, we have $2^m - 2$ sheets, each with the number 4, and the sum is $2^m + 2 + 4$. This pattern continues, and after $m$ steps, we will have $2$ sheets, each with the number $2^m$, and the sum will be $2^m + 2^m + ... + 2^m = m \cdot 2^m$.

However, we need to consider the full process, which involves $m 2^{m-1}$ steps. After $m 2^{m-1}$ steps, we will have $2$ sheets, each with the number $2^m$, and the sum will be $2 \cdot 2^m = 2^{m+1}$. But, to reach the minimum sum, we need to consider the intermediate steps, which involve the sum of the numbers on the sheets, and the sum of the numbers on the sheets after each step, which will be at least $4^m$ when considering the full process. </think>
<answer> 4^m </answer>","Let $P_{k}$ be the product of the numbers on the sheets after $k$ steps.

Suppose that in the $(k+1)^{\text {th }}$ step the numbers $a$ and $b$ are replaced by $a+b$. In the product, the number $a b$ is replaced by $(a+b)^{2}$, and the other factors do not change. Since $(a+b)^{2} \geqslant 4 a b$, we see that $P_{k+1} \geqslant 4 P_{k}$. Starting with $P_{0}=1$, a straightforward induction yields

$$
P_{k} \geqslant 4^{k}
$$

for all integers $k \geqslant 0$; in particular

$$
P_{m \cdot 2^{m-1}} \geqslant 4^{m \cdot 2^{m-1}}=\left(2^{m}\right)^{2^{m}}
$$

so by the AM-GM inequality, the sum of the numbers written on the sheets after $m 2^{m-1}$ steps is at least

$$
2^{m} \cdot \sqrt[2^{m}]{P_{m \cdot 2^{m-1}}} \geqslant 2^{m} \cdot 2^{m}=4^{m}

Consider $n \geqslant 3$ lines in the plane such that no two lines are parallel and no three have a common point. These lines divide the plane into polygonal regions; let $\mathcal{F}$ be the set of regions having finite area. Prove that it is possible to colour $\lceil\sqrt{n / 2}\rceil$ of the lines blue in such a way that no region in $\mathcal{F}$ has a completely blue boundary. (For a real number $x,\lceil x\rceil$ denotes the least integer which is not smaller than $x$.)
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the regions formed by the lines. The lines divide the plane into a number of regions, and we need to color some of these lines blue in such a way that no region in the set $\mathcal{F}$ has a completely blue boundary. 

We start by noting that the number of regions formed by $n$ lines is given by the formula $R = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. The goal is to color $\lceil\sqrt{n / 2}\rceil$ lines blue, and we need to ensure that no region has a completely blue boundary. 

A key observation is that if we color a line blue, it can only contribute to the boundary of regions that it intersects. If we color a line blue, it can intersect up to $n-1$ other lines, and each intersection can contribute to the boundary of up to two regions. 

To achieve the goal, we can use a strategy of coloring lines in a way that minimizes the number of blue regions. One effective approach is to consider the structure of the regions and the intersections. If we color a line blue, it can be part of the boundary of up to two regions, and we need to ensure that these regions do not have a completely blue boundary. 

Let's consider the case when $n = 3$. Here, we have 3 lines, and they divide the plane into 3 regions. We can color one line blue, and it will contribute to the boundary of 2 regions. This is feasible because the regions formed by 3 lines can be colored in such a way that one line can be part of the boundary of 2 regions without forming a completely blue boundary. 

For larger $n$, we can use a similar strategy. We need to find a way to color $\lceil\sqrt{n / 2}\rceil$ lines such that the regions formed do not have a completely blue boundary. This can be done by considering the intersections and the structure of the regions, and by ensuring that the coloring is done in a way that minimizes the number of blue regions. </think>
<answer> \lceil\sqrt{n / 2}\rceil </answer>","Let $L$ be the given set of lines. Choose a maximal (by inclusion) subset $B \subseteq L$ such that when we colour the lines of $B$ blue, no region in $\mathcal{F}$ has a completely blue boundary. Let $|B|=k$. We claim that $k \geqslant\lceil\sqrt{n / 2}\rceil$.

Let us colour all the lines of $L \backslash B$ red. Call a point blue if it is the intersection of two blue lines. Then there are $\left(\begin{array}{l}k \\ 2\end{array}\right)$ blue points.

Now consider any red line $\ell$. By the maximality of $B$, there exists at least one region $A \in \mathcal{F}$ whose only red side lies on $\ell$. Since $A$ has at least three sides, it must have at least one blue vertex. Let us take one such vertex and associate it to $\ell$.

Since each blue point belongs to four regions (some of which may be unbounded), it is associated to at most four red lines. Thus the total number of red lines is at most $4\left(\begin{array}{l}k \\ 2\end{array}\right)$. On the other hand, this number is $n-k$, so

$$
n-k \leqslant 2 k(k-1), \quad \text { thus } n \leqslant 2 k^{2}-k \leqslant 2 k^{2} \text {, }

and finally $k \geqslant\lceil\sqrt{n / 2}\rceil$, which gives the desired result.",0,False,457

Let $M$ be a set of $n \geqslant 4$ points in the plane, no three of which are collinear. Initially these points are connected with $n$ segments so that each point in $M$ is the endpoint of exactly two segments. Then, at each step, one may choose two segments $A B$ and $C D$ sharing a common interior point and replace them by the segments $A C$ and $B D$ if none of them is present at this moment. Prove that it is impossible to perform $n^{3} / 4$ or more such moves.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the initial configuration of the points and segments. We have $n$ points, and each point is the endpoint of exactly two segments. This means that the total number of segments is $2n$. 

Now, let's analyze the operation we can perform: we can replace two segments $AB$ and $CD$ that share a common interior point with the segments $AC$ and $BD$. This operation reduces the number of segments by 2. 

If we perform this operation $k$ times, the number of segments will be reduced by $2k$. We need to find the maximum value of $k$ such that $2k \leq 2n - k$. This inequality simplifies to $3k \leq 2n$, or $k \leq \frac{2n}{3}$. 

Since we are asked to prove that it is impossible to perform $n^3 / 4$ or more such moves, we need to check if $n^3 / 4$ can be greater than or equal to $\frac{2n}{3}$. 

Let's consider the inequality $n^3 / 4 \geq \frac{2n}{3}$. Multiplying both sides by 12 to clear the fractions, we get $3n^3 \geq 8n$. Dividing both sides by $n$ (assuming $n \neq 0$), we get $3n^2 \geq 8$. This inequality holds for $n \geq 3$, but we need to check if it can be true for $n \geq 4$. 

For $n = 4$, we have $3 \cdot 4^2 = 48 \geq 8$, which is true. However, for $n = 5$, we have $3 \cdot 5^2 = 75 \geq 8$, which is also true. But for $n = 6$, we have $3 \cdot 6^2 = 108 \geq 8$, which is true, but we need to check if it can be true for $n^3 / 4$ to be $n^3 / 4$ or more. 

</think>
<answer> \frac{n^3}{4} \leq \frac{2n}{3} </answer>","A line is said to be red if it contains two points of $M$. As no three points of $M$ are collinear, each red line determines a unique pair of points of $M$. Moreover, there are precisely $\left(\begin{array}{l}n \\ 2\end{array}\right)<\frac{n^{2}}{2}$ red lines. By the value of a segment we mean the number of red lines intersecting it in its interior, and the value of a set of segments is defined to be the sum of the values of its elements. We will prove that $(i)$ the value of the initial set of segments is smaller than $n^{3} / 2$ and that (ii) each step decreases the value of the set of segments present by at least 2 . Since such a value can never be negative, these two assertions imply the statement of the problem.

To show $(i)$ we just need to observe that each segment has a value that is smaller than $n^{2} / 2$. Thus the combined value of the $n$ initial segments is indeed below $n \cdot n^{2} / 2=n^{3} / 2$.

It remains to establish (ii). Suppose that at some moment we have two segments $A B$ and $C D$ sharing an interior point $S$, and that at the next moment we have the two segments $A C$ and $B D$ instead. Let $X_{A B}$ denote the set of red lines intersecting the segment $A B$ in its interior and let the sets $X_{A C}, X_{B D}$, and $X_{C D}$ be defined similarly. We are to prove that $\left|X_{A C}\right|+\left|X_{B D}\right|+2 \leqslant\left|X_{A B}\right|+\left|X_{C D}\right|$.

As a first step in this direction, we claim that

$$
\left|X_{A C} \cup X_{B D}\right|+2 \leqslant\left|X_{A B} \cup X_{C D}\right|
\tag{1}
$$

Indeed, if $g$ is a red line intersecting, e.g. the segment $A C$ in its interior, then it has to intersect the triangle $A C S$ once again, either in the interior of its side $A S$, or in the interior of its side $C S$, or at $S$, meaning that it belongs to $X_{A B}$ or to $X_{C D}$ (see Figure 1). Moreover, the red lines $A B$ and $C D$ contribute to $X_{A B} \cup X_{C D}$ but not to $X_{A C} \cup X_{B D}$. Thereby (1) is proved.

Similarly but more easily one obtains

$$
\left|X_{A C} \cap X_{B D}\right| \leqslant\left|X_{A B} \cap X_{C D}\right|
\tag{2}
$$

Indeed, a red line $h$ appearing in $X_{A C} \cap X_{B D}$ belongs, for similar reasons as above, also to $X_{A B} \cap X_{C D}$. To make the argument precise, one may just distinguish the cases $S \in h$ (see Figure 2) and $S \notin h$ (see Figure 3). Thereby (2) is proved.

Adding (1) and (2) we obtain the desired conclusion, thus completing the solution of this problem.",0,False,504

There are $n$ circles drawn on a piece of paper in such a way that any two circles intersect in two points, and no three circles pass through the same point. Turbo the snail slides along the circles in the following fashion. Initially he moves on one of the circles in clockwise direction. Turbo always keeps sliding along the current circle until he reaches an intersection with another circle. Then he continues his journey on this new circle and also changes the direction of moving, i.e. from clockwise to anticlockwise or vice versa.

Suppose that Turbo's path entirely covers all circles. Prove that $n$ must be odd.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that $n$ must be odd, let's analyze the movement of Turbo the snail. We know that Turbo starts on one circle and moves along it until he reaches an intersection with another circle. At this intersection, he changes direction and moves to the new circle. This process continues until he has visited all circles. 

Since Turbo's path covers all circles, he must have visited each circle exactly once. Let's consider the implications of the direction changes. If Turbo changes direction at each intersection, he will alternate between clockwise and anticlockwise directions. 

If $n$ were even, the total number of direction changes would be even (since he changes direction after each intersection, and there are an even number of circles). However, this would mean that the last circle he visits would be in the same direction as the first circle, which is not possible because he would have to change direction to reach it. 

Therefore, $n$ must be odd to allow for an odd number of direction changes, ensuring that the last circle visited is in a different direction from the first circle. </think>
<answer> n must be odd </answer>","Replace every cross (i.e. intersection of two circles) by two small circle arcs that indicate the direction in which the snail should leave the cross (see Figure 1.1). Notice that the placement of the small arcs does not depend on the direction of moving on the curves; no matter which direction the snail is moving on the circle arcs, he will follow the same curves (see Figure 1.2). In this way we have a set of curves, that are the possible paths of the snail. Call these curves snail orbits or just orbits. Every snail orbit is a simple closed curve that has no intersection with any other orbit.

<img_3222>

Figure 1.1

<img_3315>

Figure 1.2

We prove the following, more general statement.

(*) In any configuration of $n$ circles such that no two of them are tangent, the number of snail orbits has the same parity as the number $n$. (Note that it is not assumed that all circle pairs intersect.)

This immediately solves the problem.

Let us introduce the following operation that will be called flipping a cross. At a cross, remove the two small arcs of the orbits, and replace them by the other two arcs. Hence, when the snail arrives at a flipped cross, he will continue on the other circle as before, but he will preserve the orientation in which he goes along the circle arcs (see Figure 2).
<img_3874>

Figure 2

Consider what happens to the number of orbits when a cross is flipped. Denote by $a, b, c$, and $d$ the four arcs that meet at the cross such that $a$ and $b$ belong to the same circle. Before the flipping $a$ and $b$ were connected to $c$ and $d$, respectively, and after the flipping $a$ and $b$ are connected to $d$ and $c$, respectively.

The orbits passing through the cross are closed curves, so each of the arcs $a, b, c$, and $d$ is connected to another one by orbits outside the cross. We distinguish three cases.

Case 1: $a$ is connected to $b$ and $c$ is connected to $d$ by the orbits outside the cross (see Figure 3.1).



We show that this case is impossible. Remove the two small arcs at the cross, connect $a$ to $b$, and connect $c$ to $d$ at the cross. Let $\gamma$ be the new closed curve containing $a$ and $b$, and let $\delta$ be the new curve that connects $c$ and $d$. These two curves intersect at the cross. So one of $c$ and $d$ is inside $\gamma$ and the other one is outside $\gamma$. Then the two closed curves have to meet at least one more time, but this is a contradiction, since no orbit can intersect itself.

<img_3189>

Figure 3.1

<img_3836>

Figure 3.2
<img_3554>

Figure 3.3

Case 2: $a$ is connected to $c$ and $b$ is connected to $d$ (see Figure 3.2).

Before the flipping $a$ and $c$ belong to one orbit and $b$ and $d$ belong to another orbit. Flipping the cross merges the two orbits into a single orbit. Hence, the number of orbits decreases by 1 .

Case 3: $a$ is connected to $d$ and $b$ is connected to $c$ (see Figure 3.3).

Before the flipping the $\operatorname{arcs} a, b, c$, and $d$ belong to a single orbit. Flipping the cross splits that orbit in two. The number of orbits increases by 1 .

As can be seen, every flipping decreases or increases the number of orbits by one, thus changes its parity.

Now flip every cross, one by one. Since every pair of circles has 0 or 2 intersections, the number of crosses is even. Therefore, when all crosses have been flipped, the original parity of the number of orbits is restored. So it is sufficient to prove $(*)$ for the new configuration, where all crosses are flipped. Of course also in this new configuration the (modified) orbits are simple closed curves not intersecting each other.

Orient the orbits in such a way that the snail always moves anticlockwise along the circle arcs. Figure 4 shows the same circles as in Figure 1 after flipping all crosses and adding orientation. (Note that this orientation may be different from the orientation of the orbit as a planar curve; the orientation of every orbit may be negative as well as positive, like the middle orbit in Figure 4.) If the snail moves around an orbit, the total angle change in his moving direction, the total curvature, is either $+2 \pi$ or $-2 \pi$, depending on the orientation of the orbit. Let $P$ and $N$ be the number of orbits with positive and negative orientation, respectively. Then the total curvature of all orbits is $(P-N) \cdot 2 \pi$.

<img_3813>

Figure 4

<img_3783>

Figure 5

Double-count the total curvature of all orbits. Along every circle the total curvature is $2 \pi$. At every cross, the two turnings make two changes with some angles having the same absolute value but opposite signs, as depicted in Figure 5. So the changes in the direction at the crosses cancel out. Hence, the total curvature is $n \cdot 2 \pi$.

Now we have $(P-N) \cdot 2 \pi=n \cdot 2 \pi$, so $P-N=n$. The number of (modified) orbits is $P+N$, that has a same parity as $P-N=n$.",0,True,233

Prove that the lines $B M$ and $C N$ intersect on the circumcircle of the triangle $A B C$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have points \(P\) and \(Q\) on side \(BC\) of triangle \(ABC\) such that \(\angle PAB = \angle ACB\) and \(\angle QAC = \angle CBA\). This means that \(P\) and \(Q\) are the points where the angle bisectors of \(\angle BAC\) intersect \(BC\). 

Next, we have points \(M\) and \(N\) on the rays \(AP\) and \(AQ\) respectively, such that \(AP = PM\) and \(AQ = QN\). This means that \(M\) and \(N\) are the points that are twice the distance from \(A\) to \(P\) and \(Q\), respectively. 

Now, let's consider the circumcircle of triangle \(ABC\). Since \(P\) and \(Q\) are the points where the angle bisectors of \(\angle BAC\) intersect \(BC\), they are the points where the angle bisectors of \(\angle BAC\) are extended to intersect the circumcircle. 

Since \(M\) and \(N\) are on the rays \(AP\) and \(AQ\) respectively, and they are twice the distance from \(A\), they are effectively the points where the angle bisectors of \(\angle BAC\) are extended to the circumcircle. This means that \(M\) and \(N\) are the points where the angle bisectors of \(\angle BAC\) intersect the circumcircle again. 

Therefore, the lines \(BM\) and \(CN\) intersect on the circumcircle of triangle \(ABC\). </think>

Let moreover $\beta=\angle Q A C=\angle C B A$ and $\gamma=\angle P A B=\angle A C B$. From these equalities it follows that the triangles $A B P$ and $C A Q$ are similar (see Figure 1). Therefore we obtain

$$
\frac{B P}{P M}=\frac{B P}{P A}=\frac{A Q}{Q C}=\frac{N Q}{Q C}
$$

Moreover,

$$
\angle B P M=\beta+\gamma=\angle C Q N
$$

Hence the triangles $B P M$ and $N Q C$ are similar. This gives $\angle B M P=\angle N C Q$, so the triangles $B P M$ and $B S C$ are also similar. Thus we get

$$
\angle C S B=\angle B P M=\beta+\gamma=180^{\circ}-\angle B A C

Let $A B C$ be a triangle. The points $K, L$, and $M$ lie on the segments $B C, C A$, and $A B$, respectively, such that the lines $A K, B L$, and $C M$ intersect in a common point. Prove that it is possible to choose two of the triangles $A L M, B M K$, and $C K L$ whose inradii sum up to at least the inradius of the triangle $A B C$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions. We have three points $K, L, M$ on the sides of triangle $ABC$ such that the lines $AK, BL, CM$ intersect at a common point. This common point is known as the Miquel point of the triangle. We need to show that the sum of the inradii of two of the triangles $ALM, BMK, CKL$ is at least the inradius of triangle $ABC$.

To approach this, let's first recall that the inradius of a triangle is the radius of the inscribed circle, which is the circle that is tangent to all three sides of the triangle. The inradius $r$ of a triangle with area $A$ and semiperimeter $s$ is given by $r = \frac{A}{s}$.

Now, let's consider the triangles $ALM, BMK, CKL$. The inradius of each of these triangles can be expressed in terms of the area and semiperimeter of the respective triangles. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the Miquel point has a special property: it divides the triangle into three smaller triangles whose areas are proportional to the inradii of the original triangle. This means that if we can show that the sum of the inradii of two of these smaller triangles is at least the inradius of the original triangle, we are done.

Since the Miquel point divides the triangle into three smaller triangles, and the inradii of these triangles are proportional to the areas of the smaller triangles, we can infer that the sum of the inradii of two of these smaller triangles will be at least the inradius of the original triangle. This is because the inradius of the original triangle is the average of the inradii of the three smaller triangles, and if we sum the inradii of two of the smaller triangles, we will exceed the inradius of the original triangle.

$$
a=\frac{B K}{K C}, \quad b=\frac{C L}{L A}, \quad c=\frac{A M}{M B}
$$

By CEvA's theorem, $a b c=1$, so we may, without loss of generality, assume that $a \geqslant 1$. Then at least one of the numbers $b$ or $c$ is not greater than 1. Therefore at least one of the pairs $(a, b)$, $(b, c)$ has its first component not less than 1 and the second one not greater than 1 . Without loss of generality, assume that $1 \leqslant a$ and $b \leqslant 1$.

Therefore, we obtain $b c \leqslant 1$ and $1 \leqslant c a$, or equivalently

$$
\frac{A M}{M B} \leqslant \frac{L A}{C L} \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{M B}{A M} \leqslant \frac{B K}{K C}
$$

The first inequality implies that the line passing through $M$ and parallel to $B C$ intersects the segment $A L$ at a point $X$ (see Figure 1). Therefore the inradius of the triangle $A L M$ is not less than the inradius $r_{1}$ of triangle $A M X$.

Similarly, the line passing through $M$ and parallel to $A C$ intersects the segment $B K$ at a point $Y$, so the inradius of the triangle $B M K$ is not less than the inradius $r_{2}$ of the triangle $B M Y$. Thus, to complete our solution, it is enough to show that $r_{1}+r_{2} \geqslant r$, where $r$ is the inradius of the triangle $A B C$. We prove that in fact $r_{1}+r_{2}=r$.

<img_3950>

Figure 1

Since $M X \| B C$, the dilation with centre $A$ that takes $M$ to $B$ takes the incircle of the triangle $A M X$ to the incircle of the triangle $A B C$. Therefore

$$

Let $\Omega$ and $O$ be the circumcircle and the circumcentre of an acute-angled triangle $A B C$ with $A B>B C$. The angle bisector of $\angle A B C$ intersects $\Omega$ at $M \neq B$. Let $\Gamma$ be the circle with diameter $B M$. The angle bisectors of $\angle A O B$ and $\angle B O C$ intersect $\Gamma$ at points $P$ and $Q$, respectively. The point $R$ is chosen on the line $P Q$ so that $B R=M R$. Prove that $B R \| A C$. (Here we always assume that an angle bisector is a ray.)
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric properties involved. We have an acute-angled triangle \(ABC\) with circumcircle \(\Omega\) and circumcenter \(O\). The angle bisector of \(\angle ABC\) intersects \(\Omega\) at point \(M \neq B\). The circle \(\Gamma\) has diameter \(BM\), and the angle bisectors of \(\angle AOB\) and \(\angle BOC\) intersect \(\Gamma\) at points \(P\) and \(Q\), respectively. Point \(R\) is chosen on the line \(PQ\) such that \(BR = MR\). We need to prove that \(BR \parallel AC\).

Since \(M\) is on the angle bisector of \(\angle ABC\), it means that \(\angle ABM = \angle CBM\). The circle \(\Gamma\) with diameter \(BM\) implies that \(\angle BPM = 90^\circ\). The angle bisectors of \(\angle AOB\) and \(\angle BOC\) intersect \(\Gamma\) at points \(P\) and \(Q\), respectively, and since \(\Gamma\) is a circle with diameter \(BM\), \(\angle BOP = \angle BQO = 45^\circ\).

Now, since \(BR = MR\), point \(R\) is the reflection of \(M\) over the line \(PQ\). This means that \(R\) lies on the line \(PQ\) and is symmetric to \(M\) with respect to \(PQ\). Because of the symmetry and the fact that \(\angle BPM = 90^\circ\), the line \(BR\) is parallel to the line \(AC\). This is because the reflection of \(M\) over the angle bisector of \(\angle ABC\) (which is the line \(PQ\)) results in a line that is parallel to the side \(AC\).

\[
\boxed{BR \parallel AC}
\]","Let $K$ be the midpoint of $B M$, i.e., the centre of $\Gamma$. Notice that $A B \neq B C$ implies $K \neq O$. Clearly, the lines $O M$ and $O K$ are the perpendicular bisectors of $A C$ and $B M$, respectively. Therefore, $R$ is the intersection point of $P Q$ and $O K$.

Let $N$ be the second point of intersection of $\Gamma$ with the line $O M$. Since $B M$ is a diameter of $\Gamma$, the lines $B N$ and $A C$ are both perpendicular to $O M$. Hence $B N \| A C$, and it suffices to prove that $B N$ passes through $R$. Our plan for doing this is to interpret the lines $B N, O K$, and $P Q$ as the radical axes of three appropriate circles.

Let $\omega$ be the circle with diameter $B O$. Since $\angle B N O=\angle B K O=90^{\circ}$, the points $N$ and $K$ lie on $\omega$.

Next we show that the points $O, K, P$, and $Q$ are concyclic. To this end, let $D$ and $E$ be the midpoints of $B C$ and $A B$, respectively. Clearly, $D$ and $E$ lie on the rays $O Q$ and $O P$, respectively. By our assumptions about the triangle $A B C$, the points $B, E, O, K$, and $D$ lie in this order on $\omega$. It follows that $\angle E O R=\angle E B K=\angle K B D=\angle K O D$, so the line $K O$ externally bisects the angle $P O Q$. Since the point $K$ is the centre of $\Gamma$, it also lies on the perpendicular bisector of $P Q$. So $K$ coincides with the midpoint of the arc $P O Q$ of the circumcircle $\gamma$ of triangle $P O Q$.

Thus the lines $O K, B N$, and $P Q$ are pairwise radical axes of the circles $\omega, \gamma$, and $\Gamma$. Hence they are concurrent at $R$, as required.

Consider a fixed circle $\Gamma$ with three fixed points $A, B$, and $C$ on it. Also, let us fix a real number $\lambda \in(0,1)$. For a variable point $P \notin\{A, B, C\}$ on $\Gamma$, let $M$ be the point on the segment $C P$ such that $C M=\lambda \cdot C P$. Let $Q$ be the second point of intersection of the circumcircles of the triangles $A M P$ and $B M C$. Prove that as $P$ varies, the point $Q$ lies on a fixed circle.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given points and the conditions. We have a circle $\Gamma$ with three fixed points $A$, $B$, and $C$ on it. A variable point $P$ is on $\Gamma$, and $M$ is the point on the segment $CP$ such that $CM = \lambda \cdot CP$. We need to find the point $Q$ which is the second intersection of the circumcircles of triangles $AMP$ and $BMC$. We need to prove that as $P$ varies, the point $Q$ lies on a fixed circle.

To approach this, let's first consider the geometric properties and relationships. The point $M$ divides $CP$ in the ratio $\lambda : (1-\lambda)$. This means that $M$ is a weighted average of $C$ and $P$ with weights $\lambda$ and $(1-\lambda)$, respectively. 

Now, let's consider the circumcircles of triangles $AMP$ and $BMC$. The point $Q$ is the second intersection of these two circumcircles. We need to show that $Q$ lies on a fixed circle. 

One way to approach this is to use the concept of the radical axis. The radical axis of two circles is the locus of points that have equal power with respect to both circles. The radical axis of the circumcircles of triangles $AMP$ and $BMC$ is the line that passes through the points of intersection of these two circles, which is the line $Q$. 

Since the point $M$ is a weighted average of $C$ and $P$, and the point $Q$ is the second intersection of the circumcircles of $AMP$ and $BMC$, the point $Q$ will be such that it maintains a specific geometric relationship with the points $A$, $B$, and $C$ as $P$ varies. This relationship is that $Q$ lies on a circle that is the image of the original circle $\Gamma$ under a specific transformation, which is a circle that is fixed in position relative to the original circle $\Gamma$.

</think>
<answer> The point $Q$ lies on a fixed circle. </answer>","Throughout the solution, we denote by $\sphericalangle(a, b)$ the directed angle between the lines $a$ and $b$.

Let $D$ be the point on the segment $A B$ such that $B D=\lambda \cdot B A$. We will show that either $Q=D$, or $\sphericalangle(D Q, Q B)=\sphericalangle(A B, B C)$; this would mean that the point $Q$ varies over the constant circle through $D$ tangent to $B C$ at $B$, as required.

Denote the circumcircles of the triangles $A M P$ and $B M C$ by $\omega_{A}$ and $\omega_{B}$, respectively. The lines $A P, B C$, and $M Q$ are pairwise radical axes of the circles $\Gamma, \omega_{A}$, and $\omega_{B}$, thus either they are parallel, or they share a common point $X$.

Assume that these lines are parallel (see Figure 1). Then the segments $A P, Q M$, and $B C$ have a common perpendicular bisector; the reflection in this bisector maps the segment $C P$ to $B A$, and maps $M$ to $Q$. Therefore, in this case $Q$ lies on $A B$, and $B Q / A B=C M / C P=$ $B D / A B$; so we have $Q=D$.

Figure 2

Now assume that the lines $A P, Q M$, and $B C$ are concurrent at some point $X$ (see Figure 2). Notice that the points $A, B, Q$, and $X$ lie on a common circle $\Omega$ by MiQUEL's theorem applied to the triangle $X P C$. Let us denote by $Y$ the symmetric image of $X$ about the perpendicular bisector of $A B$. Clearly, $Y$ lies on $\Omega$, and the triangles $Y A B$ and $\triangle X B A$ are congruent. Moreover, the triangle $X P C$ is similar to the triangle $X B A$, so it is also similar to the triangle $Y A B$.

Next, the points $D$ and $M$ correspond to each other in similar triangles $Y A B$ and $X P C$, since $B D / B A=C M / C P=\lambda$. Moreover, the triangles $Y A B$ and $X P C$ are equi-oriented, so $\sphericalangle(M X, X P)=\sphericalangle(D Y, Y A)$. On the other hand, since the points $A, Q, X$, and $Y$ lie on $\Omega$, we have $\sphericalangle(Q Y, Y A)=\sphericalangle(M X, X P)$. Therefore, $\sphericalangle(Q Y, Y A)=\sphericalangle(D Y, Y A)$, so the points $Y, D$, and $Q$ are collinear.

Finally, we have $\sphericalangle(D Q, Q B)=\sphericalangle(Y Q, Q B)=\sphericalangle(Y A, A B)=\sphericalangle(A B, B X)=\sphericalangle(A B, B C)$, as desired.",0,False,458

Let $A B C D$ be a convex quadrilateral with $\angle B=\angle D=90^{\circ}$. Point $H$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $B D$. The points $S$ and $T$ are chosen on the sides $A B$ and $A D$, respectively, in such a way that $H$ lies inside triangle $S C T$ and

$$
\angle S H C-\angle B S C=90^{\circ}, \quad \angle T H C-\angle D T C=90^{\circ} .
$$

Prove that the circumcircle of triangle $S H T$ is tangent to the line $B D$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with $\angle B = \angle D = 90^\circ$. Point $H$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $BD$. Points $S$ and $T$ are chosen on $AB$ and $AD$ respectively such that $H$ lies inside triangle $SCT$ and the angles $\angle SHC - \angle BSC = 90^\circ$ and $\angle THC - \angle DTC = 90^\circ$.

Since $H$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $BD$, we know that $AH \perp BD$. This implies that $H$ lies on the circle with diameter $BD$. Now, let's consider the angles given. The condition $\angle SHC - \angle BSC = 90^\circ$ and $\angle THC - \angle DTC = 90^\circ$ suggests that $S$ and $T$ are positioned in a way that the angles formed with $H$ and the sides of the quadrilateral are significant. 

Given that $H$ is inside triangle $SCT$, and considering the perpendicularity and the angles, we can infer that $S$ and $T$ are positioned such that the circumcircle of triangle $SHT$ is tangent to $BD$. This is because the perpendicularity and the specific angle conditions imply that the circle centered at $H$ with radius $HT$ is tangent to $BD$ when extended to the circumcircle of $SHT$.

</think>
<answer> The circumcircle of triangle $SHT$ is tangent to the line $BD$ </answer>","Let the line passing through $C$ and perpendicular to the line $S C$ intersect the line $A B$ at $Q$ (see Figure 1). Then

$$
\angle S Q C=90^{\circ}-\angle B S C=180^{\circ}-\angle S H C
$$

which implies that the points $C, H, S$, and $Q$ lie on a common circle. Moreover, since $S Q$ is a diameter of this circle, we infer that the circumcentre $K$ of triangle $S H C$ lies on the line $A B$. Similarly, we prove that the circumcentre $L$ of triangle $C H T$ lies on the line $A D$.

<img_3673>

Figure 1

In order to prove that the circumcircle of triangle $S H T$ is tangent to $B D$, it suffices to show that the perpendicular bisectors of $H S$ and $H T$ intersect on the line $A H$. However, these two perpendicular bisectors coincide with the angle bisectors of angles $A K H$ and $A L H$. Therefore, in order to complete the solution, it is enough (by the bisector theorem) to show that

$$
\frac{A K}{K H}=\frac{A L}{L H}\tag{1}
$$

We present two proofs of this equality.

First proof. Let the lines $K L$ and $H C$ intersect at $M$ (see Figure 2). Since $K H=K C$ and $L H=L C$, the points $H$ and $C$ are symmetric to each other with respect to the line $K L$. Therefore $M$ is the midpoint of $H C$. Denote by $O$ the circumcentre of quadrilateral $A B C D$. Then $O$ is the midpoint of $A C$. Therefore we have $O M \| A H$ and hence $O M \perp B D$. This together with the equality $O B=O D$ implies that $O M$ is the perpendicular bisector of $B D$ and therefore $B M=D M$.

Since $C M \perp K L$, the points $B, C, M$, and $K$ lie on a common circle with diameter $K C$. Similarly, the points $L, C, M$, and $D$ lie on a circle with diameter $L C$. Thus, using the sine law, we obtain

$$
\frac{A K}{A L}=\frac{\sin \angle A L K}{\sin \angle A K L}=\frac{D M}{C L} \cdot \frac{C K}{B M}=\frac{C K}{C L}=\frac{K H}{L H}
$$



which finishes the proof of (1).

<img_3365>

Figure 2

<img_3512>

Figure 3

Second proof. If the points $A, H$, and $C$ are collinear, then $A K=A L$ and $K H=L H$, so the equality (1) follows. Assume therefore that the points $A, H$, and $C$ do not lie in a line and consider the circle $\omega$ passing through them (see Figure 3). Since the quadrilateral $A B C D$ is cyclic,

$$
\angle B A C=\angle B D C=90^{\circ}-\angle A D H=\angle H A D .
$$

Let $N \neq A$ be the intersection point of the circle $\omega$ and the angle bisector of $\angle C A H$. Then $A N$ is also the angle bisector of $\angle B A D$. Since $H$ and $C$ are symmetric to each other with respect to the line $K L$ and $H N=N C$, it follows that both $N$ and the centre of $\omega$ lie on the line $K L$. This means that the circle $\omega$ is an Apollonius circle of the points $K$ and $L$. This immediately yields (1).",0,False,357

Let $A B C$ be a fixed acute-angled triangle. Consider some points $E$ and $F$ lying on the sides $A C$ and $A B$, respectively, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $E F$. Let the perpendicular bisector of $E F$ intersect the line $B C$ at $K$, and let the perpendicular bisector of $M K$ intersect the lines $A C$ and $A B$ at $S$ and $T$, respectively. We call the pair $(E, F)$ interesting, if the quadrilateral $K S A T$ is cyclic.

Suppose that the pairs $\left(E_{1}, F_{1}\right)$ and $\left(E_{2}, F_{2}\right)$ are interesting. Prove that

$$
\frac{E_{1} E_{2}}{A B}=\frac{F_{1} F_{2}}{A C}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions and the properties of the points and lines involved. We need to show that if the pairs \((E_1, F_1)\) and \((E_2, F_2)\) are interesting, then the ratio \(\frac{E_1 E_2}{AB} = \frac{F_1 F_2}{AC}\) holds true. 

Given that the quadrilateral \(K S A T\) is cyclic for both pairs, we can use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the perpendicular bisectors to derive the required ratio. 

Since \(K\) is the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of \(EF\) with \(BC\), and \(M\) is the midpoint of \(EF\), the perpendicular bisector of \(EF\) is also the perpendicular bisector of \(MK\). This means that \(K\) is equidistant from \(E\) and \(F\), and \(M\) is equidistant from \(K\).

Now, consider the perpendicular bisector of \(MK\). This line intersects \(AC\) at \(S\) and \(AB\) at \(T\). Since \(K\) is on \(BC\), and the perpendicular bisector of \(MK\) intersects \(AC\) and \(AB\), the points \(S\) and \(T\) are such that \(S\) and \(T\) are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of \(MK\).

Given that the quadrilateral \(K S A T\) is cyclic, the angles subtended by the chords \(KS\), \(SA\), \(ST\), and \(TA\) are related in a specific way. Specifically, the angles \(\angle KSA\) and \(\angle KTA\) are supplementary, and the angles \(\angle SAK\) and \(\angle TAK\) are also supplementary. 

Using the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the fact that the perpendicular bisectors create equal distances, we can deduce that the segments \(E_1 E_2\) and \(F_1 F_2\) are related to the sides \(AB\) and \(AC\) in a specific ratio. </think>
<answer> \frac{E_1 E_2}{AB} = \frac{F_1 F_2}{AC} </answer>","For any interesting pair $(E, F)$, we will say that the corresponding triangle $E F K$ is also interesting.

Let $E F K$ be an interesting triangle. Firstly, we prove that $\angle K E F=\angle K F E=\angle A$, which also means that the circumcircle $\omega_{1}$ of the triangle $A E F$ is tangent to the lines $K E$ and $K F$.

Denote by $\omega$ the circle passing through the points $K, S, A$, and $T$. Let the line $A M$ intersect the line $S T$ and the circle $\omega$ (for the second time) at $N$ and $L$, respectively (see Figure 1).

Since $E F \| T S$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $E F, N$ is the midpoint of $S T$. Moreover, since $K$ and $M$ are symmetric to each other with respect to the line $S T$, we have $\angle K N S=\angle M N S=$ $\angle L N T$. Thus the points $K$ and $L$ are symmetric to each other with respect to the perpendicular bisector of $S T$. Therefore $K L \| S T$.

Let $G$ be the point symmetric to $K$ with respect to $N$. Then $G$ lies on the line $E F$, and we may assume that it lies on the ray $M F$. One has

$$
\angle K G E=\angle K N S=\angle S N M=\angle K L A=180^{\circ}-\angle K S A
$$

(if $K=L$, then the angle $K L A$ is understood to be the angle between $A L$ and the tangent to $\omega$ at $L$ ). This means that the points $K, G, E$, and $S$ are concyclic. Now, since $K S G T$ is a parallelogram, we obtain $\angle K E F=\angle K S G=180^{\circ}-\angle T K S=\angle A$. Since $K E=K F$, we also have $\angle K F E=\angle K E F=\angle A$.

After having proved this fact, one may finish the solution by different methods.

First method. We have just proved that all interesting triangles are similar to each other. This allows us to use the following lemma.



Lemma. Let $A B C$ be an arbitrary triangle. Choose two points $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ on the side $A C$, two points $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ on the side $A B$, and two points $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ on the side $B C$, in a way that the triangles $E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}$ and $E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}$ are similar. Then the six circumcircles of the triangles $A E_{i} F_{i}$, $B F_{i} K_{i}$, and $C E_{i} K_{i}(i=1,2)$ meet at a common point $Z$. Moreover, $Z$ is the centre of the spiral similarity that takes the triangle $E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}$ to the triangle $E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}$.

Proof. Firstly, notice that for each $i=1,2$, the circumcircles of the triangles $A E_{i} F_{i}, B F_{i} K_{i}$, and $C K_{i} E_{i}$ have a common point $Z_{i}$ by MiqueL's theorem. Moreover, we have

$\sphericalangle\left(Z_{i} F_{i}, Z_{i} E_{i}\right)=\sphericalangle(A B, C A), \quad \sphericalangle\left(Z_{i} K_{i}, Z_{i} F_{i}\right)=\sphericalangle(B C, A B), \quad \sphericalangle\left(Z_{i} E_{i}, Z_{i} K_{i}\right)=\sphericalangle(C A, B C)$.

This yields that the points $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{2}$ correspond to each other in similar triangles $E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}$ and $E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}$. Thus, if they coincide, then this common point is indeed the desired centre of a spiral similarity.

Finally, in order to show that $Z_{1}=Z_{2}$, one may notice that $\sphericalangle\left(A B, A Z_{1}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(E_{1} F_{1}, E_{1} Z_{1}\right)=$ $\sphericalangle\left(E_{2} F_{2}, E_{2} Z_{2}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(A B, A Z_{2}\right)$ (see Figure 2$)$. Similarly, one has $\sphericalangle\left(B C, B Z_{1}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(B C, B Z_{2}\right)$ and $\sphericalangle\left(C A, C Z_{1}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(C A, C Z_{2}\right)$. This yields $Z_{1}=Z_{2}$.

Now, let $P$ and $Q$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $B$ and $C$ onto $A C$ and $A B$, respectively, and let $R$ be the midpoint of $B C$ (see Figure 3). Then $R$ is the circumcentre of the cyclic quadrilateral $B C P Q$. Thus we obtain $\angle A P Q=\angle B$ and $\angle R P C=\angle C$, which yields $\angle Q P R=\angle A$. Similarly, we show that $\angle P Q R=\angle A$. Thus, all interesting triangles are similar to the triangle $P Q R$.

<img_3569>

Figure 3

<img_3540>

Figure 4

Denote now by $Z$ the common point of the circumcircles of $A P Q, B Q R$, and $C P R$. Let $E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}$ and $E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}$ be two interesting triangles. By the lemma, $Z$ is the centre of any spiral similarity taking one of the triangles $E_{1} F_{1} K_{1}, E_{2} F_{2} K_{2}$, and $P Q R$ to some other of them. Therefore the triangles $Z E_{1} E_{2}$ and $Z F_{1} F_{2}$ are similar, as well as the triangles $Z E_{1} F_{1}$ and $Z P Q$. Hence

$$
\frac{E_{1} E_{2}}{F_{1} F_{2}}=\frac{Z E_{1}}{Z F_{1}}=\frac{Z P}{Z Q}
$$

Moreover, the equalities $\angle A Z Q=\angle A P Q=\angle A B C=180^{\circ}-\angle Q Z R$ show that the point $Z$ lies on the line $A R$ (see Figure 4). Therefore the triangles $A Z P$ and $A C R$ are similar, as well as the triangles $A Z Q$ and $A B R$. This yields

$$
\frac{Z P}{Z Q}=\frac{Z P}{R C} \cdot \frac{R B}{Z Q}=\frac{A Z}{A C} \cdot \frac{A B}{A Z}=\frac{A B}{A C},
$$

which completes the solution.



Second method. Now we will start from the fact that $\omega_{1}$ is tangent to the lines $K E$ and $K F$ (see Figure 5$)$. We prove that if $(E, F)$ is an interesting pair, then

$$
\frac{A E}{A B}+\frac{A F}{A C}=2 \cos \angle A
\tag{1}
$$

Let $Y$ be the intersection point of the segments $B E$ and $C F$. The points $B, K$, and $C$ are collinear, hence applying PASCAL's theorem to the degenerated hexagon $A F F Y E E$, we infer that $Y$ lies on the circle $\omega_{1}$.

Denote by $Z$ the second intersection point of the circumcircle of the triangle $B F Y$ with the line $B C$ (see Figure 6). By Miquel's theorem, the points $C, Z, Y$, and $E$ are concyclic. Therefore we obtain

$$
B F \cdot A B+C E \cdot A C=B Y \cdot B E+C Y \cdot C F=B Z \cdot B C+C Z \cdot B C=B C^{2}
$$

On the other hand, $B C^{2}=A B^{2}+A C^{2}-2 A B \cdot A C \cos \angle A$, by the cosine law. Hence

$$
(A B-A F) \cdot A B+(A C-A E) \cdot A C=A B^{2}+A C^{2}-2 A B \cdot A C \cos \angle A
$$

which simplifies to the desired equality (1).

Let now $\left(E_{1}, F_{1}\right)$ and $\left(E_{2}, F_{2}\right)$ be two interesting pairs of points. Then we get

$$
\frac{A E_{1}}{A B}+\frac{A F_{1}}{A C}=\frac{A E_{2}}{A B}+\frac{A F_{2}}{A C}
$$

which gives the desired result.

<img_3657>

Figure 5

<img_3918>

Figure 6

Third method. Again, we make use of the fact that all interesting triangles are similar (and equi-oriented). Let us put the picture onto a complex plane such that $A$ is at the origin, and identify each point with the corresponding complex number.

Let $E F K$ be any interesting triangle. The equalities $\angle K E F=\angle K F E=\angle A$ yield that the ratio $\nu=\frac{K-E}{F-E}$ is the same for all interesting triangles. This in turn means that the numbers $E$, $F$, and $K$ satisfy the linear equation

$$
K=\mu E+\nu F, \quad \text { where } \quad \mu=1-\nu
\tag{2}
$$



Now let us choose the points $X$ and $Y$ on the rays $A B$ and $A C$, respectively, so that $\angle C X A=\angle A Y B=\angle A=\angle K E F$ (see Figure 7). Then each of the triangles $A X C$ and $Y A B$ is similar to any interesting triangle, which also means that

$$
C=\mu A+\nu X=\nu X \quad \text { and } \quad B=\mu Y+\nu A=\mu Y
\tag{3}
$$

Moreover, one has $X / Y=\overline{C / B}$.

Since the points $E, F$, and $K$ lie on $A C, A B$, and $B C$, respectively, one gets

$$
E=\rho Y, \quad F=\sigma X, \quad \text { and } \quad K=\lambda B+(1-\lambda) C
$$

for some real $\rho, \sigma$, and $\lambda$. In view of (3), the equation (2) now reads $\lambda B+(1-\lambda) C=K=$ $\mu E+\nu F=\rho B+\sigma C$, or

$$
(\lambda-\rho) B=(\sigma+\lambda-1) C .
$$

Since the nonzero complex numbers $B$ and $C$ have different arguments, the coefficients in the brackets vanish, so $\rho=\lambda$ and $\sigma=1-\lambda$. Therefore,

$$
\frac{E}{Y}+\frac{F}{X}=\rho+\sigma=1
\tag{4}
$$

Now, if $\left(E_{1}, F_{1}\right)$ and $\left(E_{2}, F_{2}\right)$ are two distinct interesting pairs, one may apply (4) to both pairs. Subtracting, we get

$$
\frac{E_{1}-E_{2}}{Y}=\frac{F_{2}-F_{1}}{X}, \quad \text { so } \quad \frac{E_{1}-E_{2}}{F_{2}-F_{1}}=\frac{Y}{X}=\frac{\bar{B}}{\bar{C}}
$$

Taking absolute values provides the required result.

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\Omega$ and incentre $I$. Let the line passing through $I$ and perpendicular to $C I$ intersect the segment $B C$ and the $\operatorname{arc} B C$ (not containing $A$ ) of $\Omega$ at points $U$ and $V$, respectively. Let the line passing through $U$ and parallel to $A I$ intersect $A V$ at $X$, and let the line passing through $V$ and parallel to $A I$ intersect $A B$ at $Y$. Let $W$ and $Z$ be the midpoints of $A X$ and $B C$, respectively. Prove that if the points $I, X$, and $Y$ are collinear, then the points $I, W$, and $Z$ are also collinear.

","First, let's analyze the given conditions and the geometric relationships. We know that $I$ is the incenter of triangle $ABC$, and the line through $I$ perpendicular to $CI$ intersects $BC$ at $U$ and the arc $BC$ (not containing $A$) at $V$. The line through $U$ parallel to $AI$ intersects $AV$ at $X$, and the line through $V$ parallel to $AI$ intersects $AB$ at $Y$. We need to prove that if $I, X, Y$ are collinear, then $I, W, Z$ are also collinear, where $W$ and $Z$ are the midpoints of $AX$ and $BC$, respectively.

Since $I, X, Y$ are collinear, and $X$ lies on $AV$ and $Y$ lies on $AB$, we can use the properties of the incenter and the parallel lines to infer that $X$ and $Y$ are related to the incenter in a specific way. The key is to recognize that the line through $I$ perpendicular to $CI$ and the parallel lines through $U$ and $V$ create a symmetrical setup that allows us to use the midpoint properties effectively.

Given that $W$ is the midpoint of $AX$ and $Z$ is the midpoint of $BC$, and considering the collinearity of $I, X, Y$, we can use the fact that the incenter $I$ is the intersection of the angle bisectors and the properties of the midpoints to conclude that $I, W, Z$ are collinear. This is because the setup of the parallel lines and the midpoints creates a symmetric configuration that preserves the collinearity when $I, X, Y$ are collinear.

<answer> I, W, Z </answer>","We start with some general observations. Set $\alpha=\angle A / 2, \beta=\angle B / 2, \gamma=\angle C / 2$. Then obviously $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=90^{\circ}$. Since $\angle U I C=90^{\circ}$, we obtain $\angle I U C=\alpha+\beta$. Therefore $\angle B I V=\angle I U C-\angle I B C=\alpha=\angle B A I=\angle B Y V$, which implies that the points $B, Y, I$, and $V$ lie on a common circle (see Figure 1).

Assume now that the points $I, X$ and $Y$ are collinear. We prove that $\angle Y I A=90^{\circ}$.

Let the line $X U$ intersect $A B$ at $N$. Since the lines $A I, U X$, and $V Y$ are parallel, we get

$$
\frac{N X}{A I}=\frac{Y N}{Y A}=\frac{V U}{V I}=\frac{X U}{A I}
$$

implying $N X=X U$. Moreover, $\angle B I U=\alpha=\angle B N U$. This implies that the quadrilateral $B U I N$ is cyclic, and since $B I$ is the angle bisector of $\angle U B N$, we infer that $N I=U I$. Thus in the isosceles triangle $N I U$, the point $X$ is the midpoint of the base $N U$. This gives $\angle I X N=90^{\circ}$, i.e., $\angle Y I A=90^{\circ}$.

Figure 1

Let $S$ be the midpoint of the segment $V C$. Let moreover $T$ be the intersection point of the lines $A X$ and $S I$, and set $x=\angle B A V=\angle B C V$. Since $\angle C I A=90^{\circ}+\beta$ and $S I=S C$, we obtain

$$
\angle T I A=180^{\circ}-\angle A I S=90^{\circ}-\beta-\angle C I S=90^{\circ}-\beta-\gamma-x=\alpha-x=\angle T A I,
$$

which implies that $T I=T A$. Therefore, since $\angle X I A=90^{\circ}$, the point $T$ is the midpoint of $A X$, i.e., $T=W$.

To complete our solution, it remains to show that the intersection point of the lines $I S$ and $B C$ coincide with the midpoint of the segment $B C$. But since $S$ is the midpoint of the segment $V C$, it suffices to show that the lines $B V$ and $I S$ are parallel.



Since the quadrilateral $B Y I V$ is cyclic, $\angle V B I=\angle V Y I=\angle Y I A=90^{\circ}$. This implies that $B V$ is the external angle bisector of the angle $A B C$, which yields $\angle V A C=\angle V C A$. Therefore $2 \alpha-x=2 \gamma+x$, which gives $\alpha=\gamma+x$. Hence $\angle S C I=\alpha$, so $\angle V S I=2 \alpha$.

On the other hand, $\angle B V C=180^{\circ}-\angle B A C=180^{\circ}-2 \alpha$, which implies that the lines $B V$ and $I S$ are parallel. This completes the solution.",0,False,391

A coin is called a Cape Town coin if its value is $1 / n$ for some positive integer $n$. Given a collection of Cape Town coins of total value at most $99+\frac{1}{2}$, prove that it is possible to split this collection into at most 100 groups each of total value at most 1 .
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the total value of the collection of Cape Town coins. The total value is at most $99 + \frac{1}{2}$. We need to show that this collection can be split into at most 100 groups, each with a total value of at most 1. 

To do this, we can start by considering the fractions that make up the total value. The fractions are of the form $\frac{1}{n}$, where $n$ is a positive integer. We need to find a way to combine these fractions to get a total value of 1 or less, using each fraction only once. 

One approach is to use the fractions in a way that their sum is close to 1 but does not exceed it. We can start by trying to combine fractions that add up to 1. For example, if we have fractions $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$, their sum is $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$, which is less than 1. 

If we have fractions that add up to less than 1, we can add more fractions to reach 1. For instance, if we have $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$, which is still less than 1, but if we add $\frac{1}{3}$, we get $\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 1$.

value at most $N-\frac{1}{2}$ can be split into $N$ groups each of total value at most 1 . The problem statement is a particular case for $N=100$.

We start with some preparations. If several given coins together have a total value also of the form $\frac{1}{k}$ for a positive integer $k$, then we may merge them into one new coin. Clearly, if the resulting collection can be split in the required way then the initial collection can also be split.

After each such merging, the total number of coins decreases, thus at some moment we come to a situation when no more merging is possible. At this moment, for every even $k$ there is at most one coin of value $\frac{1}{k}$ (otherwise two such coins may be merged), and for every odd $k>1$ there are at most $k-1$ coins of value $\frac{1}{k}$ (otherwise $k$ such coins may also be merged).

Now, clearly, each coin of value 1 should form a single group; if there are $d$ such coins then we may remove them from the collection and replace $N$ by $N-d$. So from now on we may assume that there are no coins of value 1 .

Finally, we may split all the coins in the following way. For each $k=1,2, \ldots, N$ we put all the coins of values $\frac{1}{2 k-1}$ and $\frac{1}{2 k}$ into a group $G_{k}$; the total value of $G_{k}$ does not exceed

$$
(2 k-2) \cdot \frac{1}{2 k-1}+\frac{1}{2 k}<1
$$

It remains to distribute the ""small"" coins of values which are less than $\frac{1}{2 N}$; we will add them one by one. In each step, take any remaining small coin. The total value of coins in the groups at this moment is at most $N-\frac{1}{2}$, so there exists a group of total value at most $\frac{1}{N}\left(N-\frac{1}{2}\right)=1-\frac{1}{2 N}$; thus it is possible to put our small coin into this group. Acting so, we will finally distribute all the coins.",0,True,4796

Let $n>1$ be a given integer. Prove that infinitely many terms of the sequence $\left(a_{k}\right)_{k \geqslant 1}$, defined by

$$
a_{k}=\left\lfloor\frac{n^{k}}{k}\right\rfloor
$$

are odd. (For a real number $x,\lfloor x\rfloor$ denotes the largest integer not exceeding $x$.)
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression for $a_k = \left\lfloor \frac{n^k}{k} \right\rfloor$. We need to show that there are infinitely many terms in this sequence that are odd. 

One way to approach this is to consider the behavior of the sequence as $k$ increases. We can start by examining the expression $\frac{n^k}{k}$ and how it behaves when divided by $k$ to get the floor function. 

If we can find a pattern or a way to manipulate the expression to make it easier to determine when the floor function results in an odd number, we can prove that there are infinitely many odd terms. 

Let's consider the case when $n$ is odd. If $n$ is odd, then $n^k$ is also odd for any integer $k$. We need to check when $\frac{n^k}{k}$ is an integer and when it results in an odd number when taking the floor. 

If $k$ is odd, then $\frac{n^k}{k}$ is an integer, and since $n^k$ is odd, $\frac{n^k}{k}$ is odd if and only if $k$ is odd. This means that for odd $k$, $a_k$ is odd. 

Now, if we can find infinitely many odd $k$, then we have infinitely many odd terms in the sequence. Since there are infinitely many odd numbers, we can indeed find infinitely many odd $k$ that satisfy the condition. </think>
<answer> \text{For any odd } k, \left\lfloor \frac{n^k}{k} \right\rfloor \text{ is odd.} </answer>","If $n$ is odd, let $k=n^{m}$ for $m=1,2, \ldots$ Then $a_{k}=n^{n^{m}-m}$, which is odd for each $m$.

Henceforth, assume that $n$ is even, say $n=2 t$ for some integer $t \geqslant 1$. Then, for any $m \geqslant 2$, the integer $n^{2^{m}}-2^{m}=2^{m}\left(2^{2^{m}-m} \cdot t^{2^{m}}-1\right)$ has an odd prime divisor $p$, since $2^{m}-m>1$. Then, for $k=p \cdot 2^{m}$, we have

$$
n^{k}=\left(n^{2^{m}}\right)^{p} \equiv\left(2^{m}\right)^{p}=\left(2^{p}\right)^{m} \equiv 2^{m}
$$

where the congruences are taken modulo $p\left(\right.$ recall that $2^{p} \equiv 2(\bmod p)$, by FERMAT's little theorem). Also, from $n^{k}-2^{m}<n^{k}<n^{k}+2^{m}(p-1)$, we see that the fraction $\frac{n^{k}}{k}$ lies strictly between the consecutive integers $\frac{n^{k}-2^{m}}{p \cdot 2^{m}}$ and $\frac{n^{k}+2^{m}(p-1)}{p \cdot 2^{m}}$, which gives

$$
\left\lfloor\frac{n^{k}}{k}\right\rfloor=\frac{n^{k}-2^{m}}{p \cdot 2^{m}}
$$

We finally observe that $\frac{n^{k}-2^{m}}{p \cdot 2^{m}}=\frac{\frac{n^{k}}{2^{m}}-1}{p}$ is an odd integer, since the integer $\frac{n^{k}}{2^{m}}-1$ is odd (recall that $k>m$ ). Note that for different values of $m$, we get different values of $k$, due to the different powers of 2 in the prime factorisation of $k$.",0,True,360

Let $a_{1}<a_{2}<\cdots<a_{n}$ be pairwise coprime positive integers with $a_{1}$ being prime and $a_{1} \geqslant n+2$. On the segment $I=\left[0, a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}\right]$ of the real line, mark all integers that are divisible by at least one of the numbers $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}$. These points split $I$ into a number of smaller segments. Prove that the sum of the squares of the lengths of these segments is divisible by $a_{1}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the segment $I = [0, a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n]$. We need to mark all integers in $I$ that are divisible by at least one of the numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. This means that the segment $I$ is divided into smaller segments by these marked points. 

The key observation is that the length of each segment is a multiple of $a_1$ because $a_1$ is the smallest number in the set and it is the only number that can divide the segment in a way that the length of the segment is a multiple of $a_1$. 

Let's denote the length of the segment from $k$ to $k+1$ as $L_k$. Since $k$ is not divisible by any of the numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$, $L_k$ is not a multiple of $a_1$. However, the segment from $k$ to $k+1$ is divided by the points that are multiples of $a_1$, and the length of each segment that is a multiple of $a_1$ is a multiple of $a_1$. 

Now, let's consider the sum of the squares of the lengths of these segments. Since each segment that is a multiple of $a_1$ has a length that is a multiple of $a_1$, the sum of the squares of these lengths will also be a multiple of $a_1^2$. However, we need to show that the sum of the squares of the lengths of all segments is divisible by $a_1$. 

To do this, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of all segments is $a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n$, and since each segment that is a multiple of $a_1$ contributes to this sum, the sum of the squares of the lengths of these segments will be divisible by $a_1$. </think>
<answer> (a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n)^2 / a_1 = a_1 a_2 \cdots a_{n-1} a_2^2 \cdots a_n^2 </answer>","Let $A=a_{1} \cdots a_{n}$. Throughout the solution, all intervals will be nonempty and have integer end-points. For any interval $X$, the length of $X$ will be denoted by $|X|$.

Define the following two families of intervals:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathcal{S}=\{[x, y]: x<y \text { are consecutive marked points }\} \\
& \mathcal{T}=\{[x, y]: x<y \text { are integers, } 0 \leqslant x \leqslant A-1, \text { and no point is marked in }(x, y)\}
\end{aligned}
$$

We are interested in computing $\sum_{X \in \mathcal{S}}|X|^{2}$ modulo $a_{1}$.

Note that the number $A$ is marked, so in the definition of $\mathcal{T}$ the condition $y \leqslant A$ is enforced without explicitly prescribing it.

Assign weights to the intervals in $\mathcal{T}$, depending only on their lengths. The weight of an arbitrary interval $Y \in \mathcal{T}$ will be $w(|Y|)$, where

$$
w(k)= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } k=1 \\ 2 & \text { if } k \geqslant 2\end{cases}
$$

Consider an arbitrary interval $X \in \mathcal{S}$ and its sub-intervals $Y \in \mathcal{T}$. Clearly, $X$ has one sub-interval of length $|X|$, two sub-intervals of length $|X|-1$ and so on; in general $X$ has $|X|-d+1$ sub-intervals of length $d$ for every $d=1,2, \ldots,|X|$. The sum of the weights of the sub-intervals of $X$ is

$$
\sum_{Y \in \mathcal{T}, Y \subseteq X} w(|Y|)=\sum_{d=1}^{|X|}(|X|-d+1) \cdot w(d)=|X| \cdot 1+((|X|-1)+(|X|-2)+\cdots+1) \cdot 2=|X|^{2}
$$

Since the intervals in $\mathcal{S}$ are non-overlapping, every interval $Y \in \mathcal{T}$ is a sub-interval of a single interval $X \in \mathcal{S}$. Therefore,

$$
\sum_{X \in \mathcal{S}}|X|^{2}=\sum_{X \in \mathcal{S}}\left(\sum_{Y \in \mathcal{T}, Y \subseteq X} w(|Y|)\right)=\sum_{Y \in \mathcal{T}} w(|Y|)\tag{1}
$$

For every $d=1,2, \ldots, a_{1}$, we count how many intervals in $\mathcal{T}$ are of length $d$. Notice that the multiples of $a_{1}$ are all marked, so the lengths of the intervals in $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ cannot exceed $a_{1}$. Let $x$ be an arbitrary integer with $0 \leqslant x \leqslant A-1$ and consider the interval $[x, x+d]$. Let $r_{1}$, $\ldots, r_{n}$ be the remainders of $x$ modulo $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively. Since $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are pairwise coprime, the number $x$ is uniquely identified by the sequence $\left(r_{1}, \ldots, r_{n}\right)$, due to the Chinese remainder theorem.

For every $i=1, \ldots, n$, the property that the interval $(x, x+d)$ does not contain any multiple of $a_{i}$ is equivalent with $r_{i}+d \leqslant a_{i}$, i.e. $r_{i} \in\left\{0,1, \ldots, a_{i}-d\right\}$, so there are $a_{i}-d+1$ choices for the number $r_{i}$ for each $i$. Therefore, the number of the remainder sequences $\left(r_{1}, \ldots, r_{n}\right)$ that satisfy $[x, x+d] \in \mathcal{T}$ is precisely $\left(a_{1}+1-d\right) \cdots\left(a_{n}+1-d\right)$. Denote this product by $f(d)$.



Now we can group the last sum in (1) by length of the intervals. As we have seen, for every $d=1, \ldots, a_{1}$ there are $f(d)$ intervals $Y \in \mathcal{T}$ with $|Y|=d$. Therefore, (1) can be continued as

$$
\sum_{X \in \mathcal{S}}|X|^{2}=\sum_{Y \in \mathcal{T}} w(|Y|)=\sum_{d=1}^{a_{1}} f(d) \cdot w(d)=2 \sum_{d=1}^{a_{1}} f(d)-f(1)\tag{2}
$$

Having the formula (2), the solution can be finished using the following well-known fact: Lemma. If $p$ is a prime, $F(x)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients, and $\operatorname{deg} F \leqslant p-2$, then $\sum_{x=1}^{p} F(x)$ is divisible by $p$.

Proof. Obviously, it is sufficient to prove the lemma for monomials of the form $x^{k}$ with $k \leqslant p-2$. Apply induction on $k$. If $k=0$ then $F=1$, and the statement is trivial.

Let $1 \leqslant k \leqslant p-2$, and assume that the lemma is proved for all lower degrees. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 & \equiv p^{k+1}=\sum_{x=1}^{p}\left(x^{k+1}-(x-1)^{k+1}\right)=\sum_{x=1}^{p}\left(\sum_{\ell=0}^{k}(-1)^{k-\ell}\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+1 \\
\ell
\end{array}\right) x^{\ell}\right) \\
& =(k+1) \sum_{x=1}^{p} x^{k}+\sum_{\ell=0}^{k-1}(-1)^{k-\ell}\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+1 \\
\ell
\end{array}\right) \sum_{x=1}^{p} x^{\ell} \equiv(k+1) \sum_{x=1}^{p} x^{k} \quad(\bmod p) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $0<k+1<p$, this proves $\sum_{x=1}^{p} x^{k} \equiv 0(\bmod p)$.

In (2), by applying the lemma to the polynomial $f$ and the prime $a_{1}$, we obtain that $\sum_{d=1}^{a_{1}} f(d)$ is divisible by $a_{1}$. The term $f(1)=a_{1} \cdots a_{n}$ is also divisible by $a_{1}$; these two facts together prove that $\sum_{X \in \mathcal{S}}|X|^{2}$ is divisible by $a_{1}$.",0,True,479

Let $c \geqslant 1$ be an integer. Define a sequence of positive integers by $a_{1}=c$ and

$$
a_{n+1}=a_{n}^{3}-4 c \cdot a_{n}^{2}+5 c^{2} \cdot a_{n}+c
$$

for all $n \geqslant 1$. Prove that for each integer $n \geqslant 2$ there exists a prime number $p$ dividing $a_{n}$ but none of the numbers $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n-1}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given sequence. We have $a_1 = c$ and the recurrence relation:
$$a_{n+1} = a_n^3 - 4c \cdot a_n^2 + 5c^2 \cdot a_n + c.$$
We need to show that for each integer $n \geq 2$, there exists a prime number $p$ dividing $a_n$ but none of the numbers $a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$.

Let's start by considering the expression for $a_{n+1}$. We can rewrite it as:
$$a_{n+1} = a_n(a_n^2 - 4c a_n + 5c^2) + c.$$
This expression shows that $a_{n+1}$ is a linear combination of $a_n$ and a quadratic polynomial in $a_n$. 

Now, let's consider the quadratic polynomial $a_n^2 - 4c a_n + 5c^2$. We need to check if this polynomial can be factored in a way that helps us find a prime divisor of $a_n$ that is not a divisor of any $a_i$ for $i < n$.

Notice that $a_n^2 - 4c a_n + 5c^2$ can be rewritten as:
$$(a_n - 2c)^2 + 3c^2.$$
This form shows that the polynomial is always positive and greater than $c^2$ for $c \geq 1$ and $a_n \geq 2c$. 

Since $a_n$ is a positive integer, and the polynomial is always positive, it means that $a_n$ is always greater than $2c$. This implies that $a_n$ cannot be a divisor of $c$ or any $a_i$ for $i < n$.

Now, let's consider the expression $a_{n+1} = a_n(a_n^2 - 4c a_n + 5c^2) + c$. Since $a_n$ is not a divisor of $c$ or any $a_i$ for $i < n$, and the term $a_n^2 - 4c a_n + 5c^2$ is always positive and greater than $c^2$, it follows that $a_{n+1}$ must have a prime divisor that is not a divisor of any $a_i$ for $i < n$.

Thus, for each integer $n \geq 2$, there exists a prime number $p$ dividing $a_n$ but none of the numbers $a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$. </think>
<answer> $$\text{For each integer } n \geq 2, \text{ there exists a prime number } p \text{ dividing } a_n \text{ but none of the numbers } a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}.$$ </answer>","Let us define $x_{0}=0$ and $x_{n}=a_{n} / c$ for all integers $n \geqslant 1$. It is easy to see that the sequence $\left(x_{n}\right)$ thus obtained obeys the recursive law

$$
x_{n+1}=c^{2}\left(x_{n}^{3}-4 x_{n}^{2}+5 x_{n}\right)+1\tag{1}
$$

for all integers $n \geqslant 0$. In particular, all of its terms are positive integers; notice that $x_{1}=1$ and $x_{2}=2 c^{2}+1$. Since

$$
x_{n+1}=c^{2} x_{n}\left(x_{n}-2\right)^{2}+c^{2} x_{n}+1>x_{n}\tag{2}
$$

holds for all integers $n \geqslant 0$, it is also strictly increasing. Since $x_{n+1}$ is by (1) coprime to $c$ for any $n \geqslant 0$, it suffices to prove that for each $n \geqslant 2$ there exists a prime number $p$ dividing $x_{n}$ but none of the numbers $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n-1}$. Let us begin by establishing three preliminary claims.

Claim 1. If $i \equiv j(\bmod m)$ holds for some integers $i, j \geqslant 0$ and $m \geqslant 1$, then $x_{i} \equiv x_{j}\left(\bmod x_{m}\right)$ holds as well.

Proof. Evidently, it suffices to show $x_{i+m} \equiv x_{i}\left(\bmod x_{m}\right)$ for all integers $i \geqslant 0$ and $m \geqslant 1$. For this purpose we may argue for fixed $m$ by induction on $i$ using $x_{0}=0$ in the base case $i=0$. Now, if we have $x_{i+m} \equiv x_{i}\left(\bmod x_{m}\right)$ for some integer $i$, then the recursive equation (1) yields

$$
x_{i+m+1} \equiv c^{2}\left(x_{i+m}^{3}-4 x_{i+m}^{2}+5 x_{i+m}\right)+1 \equiv c^{2}\left(x_{i}^{3}-4 x_{i}^{2}+5 x_{i}\right)+1 \equiv x_{i+1} \quad\left(\bmod x_{m}\right),
$$

which completes the induction.

Claim 2. If the integers $i, j \geqslant 2$ and $m \geqslant 1$ satisfy $i \equiv j(\bmod m)$, then $x_{i} \equiv x_{j}\left(\bmod x_{m}^{2}\right)$ holds as well.

Proof. Again it suffices to prove $x_{i+m} \equiv x_{i}\left(\bmod x_{m}^{2}\right)$ for all integers $i \geqslant 2$ and $m \geqslant 1$. As above, we proceed for fixed $m$ by induction on $i$. The induction step is again easy using (1), but this time the base case $i=2$ requires some calculation. Set $L=5 c^{2}$. By (1) we have $x_{m+1} \equiv L x_{m}+1\left(\bmod x_{m}^{2}\right)$, and hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_{m+1}^{3}-4 x_{m+1}^{2}+5 x_{m+1} & \equiv\left(L x_{m}+1\right)^{3}-4\left(L x_{m}+1\right)^{2}+5\left(L x_{m}+1\right) \\
& \equiv\left(3 L x_{m}+1\right)-4\left(2 L x_{m}+1\right)+5\left(L x_{m}+1\right) \equiv 2 \quad\left(\bmod x_{m}^{2}\right),
\end{aligned}
$$

which in turn gives indeed $x_{m+2} \equiv 2 c^{2}+1 \equiv x_{2}\left(\bmod x_{m}^{2}\right)$.

Claim 3. For each integer $n \geqslant 2$, we have $x_{n}>x_{1} \cdot x_{2} \cdots x_{n-2}$.

Proof. The cases $n=2$ and $n=3$ are clear. Arguing inductively, we assume now that the claim holds for some $n \geqslant 3$. Recall that $x_{2} \geqslant 3$, so by monotonicity and (2) we get $x_{n} \geqslant x_{3} \geqslant x_{2}\left(x_{2}-2\right)^{2}+x_{2}+1 \geqslant 7$. It follows that

$$
x_{n+1}>x_{n}^{3}-4 x_{n}^{2}+5 x_{n}>7 x_{n}^{2}-4 x_{n}^{2}>x_{n}^{2}>x_{n} x_{n-1},
$$

which by the induction hypothesis yields $x_{n+1}>x_{1} \cdot x_{2} \cdots x_{n-1}$, as desired.



Now we direct our attention to the problem itself: let any integer $n \geqslant 2$ be given. By Claim 3 there exists a prime number $p$ appearing with a higher exponent in the prime factorisation of $x_{n}$ than in the prime factorisation of $x_{1} \cdots x_{n-2}$. In particular, $p \mid x_{n}$, and it suffices to prove that $p$ divides none of $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n-1}$.

Otherwise let $k \in\{1, \ldots, n-1\}$ be minimal such that $p$ divides $x_{k}$. Since $x_{n-1}$ and $x_{n}$ are coprime by (1) and $x_{1}=1$, we actually have $2 \leqslant k \leqslant n-2$. Write $n=q k+r$ with some integers $q \geqslant 0$ and $0 \leqslant r<k$. By Claim 1 we have $x_{n} \equiv x_{r}\left(\bmod x_{k}\right)$, whence $p \mid x_{r}$. Due to the minimality of $k$ this entails $r=0$, i.e. $k \mid n$.

Thus from Claim 2 we infer

$$
x_{n} \equiv x_{k} \quad\left(\bmod x_{k}^{2}\right)
$$

Now let $\alpha \geqslant 1$ be maximal with the property $p^{\alpha} \mid x_{k}$. Then $x_{k}^{2}$ is divisible by $p^{\alpha+1}$ and by our choice of $p$ so is $x_{n}$. So by the previous congruence $x_{k}$ is a multiple of $p^{\alpha+1}$ as well, contrary to our choice of $\alpha$. This is the final contradiction concluding the solution.",0,False,642

For every real number $x$, let $\|x\|$ denote the distance between $x$ and the nearest integer. Prove that for every pair $(a, b)$ of positive integers there exist an odd prime $p$ and a positive integer $k$ satisfying

$$
\left\|\frac{a}{p^{k}}\right\|+\left\|\frac{b}{p^{k}}\right\|+\left\|\frac{a+b}{p^{k}}\right\|=1\tag{1}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression we need to satisfy: 
\[
\left\|\frac{a}{p^{k}}\right\|+\left\|\frac{b}{p^{k}}\right\|+\left\|\frac{a+b}{p^{k}}\right\}=1
\]
where $p$ is an odd prime and $k$ is a positive integer. The distance function $\|x\|$ is defined as the distance between $x$ and the nearest integer. 

To approach this, let's first consider the case when $a$ and $b$ are small compared to $p^k$. If $a$ and $b$ are both small, then $\frac{a}{p^k}$, $\frac{b}{p^k}$, and $\frac{a+b}{p^k}$ are also small. The sum of their distances to the nearest integer should be 1. 

One way to achieve this is to consider the fractions $\frac{1}{p^k}$, $\frac{1}{p^k}$, and $\frac{1}{p^k}$. If we take $a = p^k$, $b = p^k$, and $k = 1$, then:
\[
\left\|\frac{p^k}{p^1}\right\|+\left\|\frac{p^k}{p^1}\right\|+\left\|\frac{p^k + p^k}{p^1}\right\} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 1
\]
This satisfies the equation. </think>
<answer> \left\|\frac{p^k}{p^1}\right\|+\left\|\frac{p^k}{p^1}\right\|+\left\|\frac{p^k + p^k}{p^1}\right\} \</answer>","Notice first that $\left\lfloor x+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor$ is an integer nearest to $x$, so $\|x\|=\left|\left\lfloor x+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor-x\right|$. Thus we have

$$
\left\lfloor x+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor=x \pm\|x\|\tag{2}
$$

For every rational number $r$ and every prime number $p$, denote by $v_{p}(r)$ the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorisation of $r$. Recall the notation $(2 n-1) !$ ! for the product of all odd positive integers not exceeding $2 n-1$, i.e., $(2 n-1) ! !=1 \cdot 3 \cdots(2 n-1)$.

Lemma. For every positive integer $n$ and every odd prime $p$, we have

$$
v_{p}((2 n-1) ! !)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\left\lfloor\frac{n}{p^{k}}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor
$$

Proof. For every positive integer $k$, let us count the multiples of $p^{k}$ among the factors $1,3, \ldots$, $2 n-1$. If $\ell$ is an arbitrary integer, the number $(2 \ell-1) p^{k}$ is listed above if and only if

$$
0<(2 \ell-1) p^{k} \leqslant 2 n \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \frac{1}{2}<\ell \leqslant \frac{n}{p^{k}}+\frac{1}{2} \Longleftrightarrow 1 \leqslant \ell \leqslant\left\lfloor\frac{n}{p^{k}}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor .
$$

Hence, the number of multiples of $p^{k}$ among the factors is precisely $m_{k}=\left\lfloor\frac{n}{p^{k}}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor$. Thus we obtain

$$
v_{p}((2 n-1) ! !)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_{p}(2 i-1)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{k=1}^{v_{p}(2 i-1)} 1=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \sum_{\ell=1}^{m_{k}} 1=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\left\lfloor\frac{n}{p^{k}}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor .
$$

In order to prove the problem statement, consider the rational number

$$
N=\frac{(2 a+2 b-1) ! !}{(2 a-1) ! ! \cdot(2 b-1) ! !}=\frac{(2 a+1)(2 a+3) \cdots(2 a+2 b-1)}{1 \cdot 3 \cdots(2 b-1)} .
$$

Obviously, $N>1$, so there exists a prime $p$ with $v_{p}(N)>0$. Since $N$ is a fraction of two odd numbers, $p$ is odd.

By our lemma,

$$
0<v_{p}(N)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(\left\lfloor\frac{a+b}{p^{k}}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{a}{p^{k}}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{b}{p^{k}}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor\right) .
$$

Therefore, there exists some positive integer $k$ such that the integer number

$$
d_{k}=\left\lfloor\frac{a+b}{p^{k}}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{a}{p^{k}}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{b}{p^{k}}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor
$$

is positive, so $d_{k} \geqslant 1$. By (2) we have

$$
1 \leqslant d_{k}=\frac{a+b}{p^{k}}-\frac{a}{p^{k}}-\frac{b}{p^{k}} \pm\left\|\frac{a+b}{p^{k}}\right\| \pm\left\|\frac{a}{p^{k}}\right\| \pm\left\|\frac{b}{p^{k}}\right\|= \pm\left\|\frac{a+b}{p^{k}}\right\| \pm\left\|\frac{a}{p^{k}}\right\| \pm\left\|\frac{b}{p^{k}}\right\| .\tag{3}
$$



Since $\|x\|<\frac{1}{2}$ for every rational $x$ with odd denominator, the relation (3) can only be satisfied if all three signs on the right-hand side are positive and $d_{k}=1$. Thus we get

$$
\left\|\frac{a}{p^{k}}\right\|+\left\|\frac{b}{p^{k}}\right\|+\left\|\frac{a+b}{p^{k}}\right\|=d_{k}=1

\[
(a_2)^2 + a_2 a_3 \leq 1 + a_3

\[
a_2(a_2 + a_3) \leq 1 + a_3

<answer> a_{2022} \leq 1 </answer>","We begin by observing that $\left(a_{n+1}\right)^{2}-1 \leqslant a_{n}+a_{n+2}-a_{n} a_{n+2}-1$, which is equivalent to

$$
\left(a_{n+1}\right)^{2}-1 \leqslant\left(1-a_{n}\right)\left(a_{n+2}-1\right) .
$$

Suppose now that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $a_{n+1}>1$ and $a_{n+2}>1$. Since $\left(a_{n+1}\right)^{2}-1 \leqslant\left(1-a_{n}\right)\left(a_{n+2}-1\right)$, we deduce that $0<1-a_{n}<1<1+a_{n+2}$, thus $\left(a_{n+1}\right)^{2}-1<\left(a_{n+2}+1\right)\left(a_{n+2}-1\right)=\left(a_{n+2}\right)^{2}-1$.

On the other hand, $\left(a_{n+2}\right)^{2}-1 \leqslant\left(1-a_{n+3}\right)\left(a_{n+1}-1\right)<\left(1+a_{n+1}\right)\left(a_{n+1}-1\right)=\left(a_{n+1}\right)^{2}-1$, a contradiction. We have shown that we cannot have two consecutive terms, except maybe $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$, strictly greater than 1 .

Finally, suppose $a_{2022}>1$. This implies that $a_{2021} \leqslant 1$ and $a_{2023} \leqslant 1$. Therefore $0<$ $\left(a_{2022}\right)^{2}-1 \leqslant\left(1-a_{2021}\right)\left(a_{2023}-1\right) \leqslant 0$, a contradiction. We conclude that $a_{2022} \leqslant 1$.",0,False,592

Let $n \geqslant 3$ be an integer, and let $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$ be real numbers in the interval $[0,1]$. Let $s=x_{1}+x_{2}+\ldots+x_{n}$, and assume that $s \geqslant 3$. Prove that there exist integers $i$ and $j$ with $1 \leqslant i<j \leqslant n$ such that

$$
2^{j-i} x_{i} x_{j}>2^{s-3}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions: $n \geqslant 3$, $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n} \in [0,1]$, and $s = x_{1} + x_{2} + \ldots + x_{n} \geqslant 3$. We need to show that there exist integers $i$ and $j$ with $1 \leqslant i < j \leqslant n$ such that $2^{j-i} x_{i} x_{j} > 2^{s-3}$.

Since $s \geqslant 3$, it means that at least one of the $x_i$'s must be at least $\frac{3}{n}$. Let's assume without loss of generality that $x_1 \geqslant \frac{3}{n}$. We need to find $i$ and $j$ such that $2^{j-i} x_{i} x_{j} > 2^{s-3}$. 

If we choose $i = 1$ and $j = k$ for some $k > 1$, then we need to check if $2^{k-1} x_1 x_k > 2^{s-3}$. Since $x_1 \geqslant \frac{3}{n}$, we can simplify this to $2^{k-1} \cdot \frac{3}{n} x_k > 2^{s-3}$. 

Now, let's consider the case when $k = 2$. We need to check if $2^{2-1} \cdot \frac{3}{n} x_2 > 2^{s-3}$, which simplifies to $2 \cdot \frac{3}{n} x_2 > 2^{s-3}$. This inequality holds if $x_2 > \frac{n}{6} \cdot 2^{3-s}$. 

Since $s \geqslant 3$, $2^{s-3} \leqslant 1$, and thus $\frac{n}{6} \cdot 2^{3-s} \leqslant \frac{n}{6}$. This means that if $x_2 > \frac{n}{6}$, the inequality holds. </think>
<answer> $$2^{j-i} x_{i} x_{j} > 2^{s-3}$$ for some $i$ and $j$ with $1 \leqslant i < j \leqslant n$$</answer>","Let $1 \leqslant a<b \leqslant n$ be such that $2^{b-a} x_{a} x_{b}$ is maximal. This choice of $a$ and $b$ implies that $x_{a+t} \leqslant 2^{t} x_{a}$ for all $1-a \leqslant t \leqslant b-a-1$, and similarly $x_{b-t} \leqslant 2^{t} x_{b}$ for all $b-n \leqslant t \leqslant b-a+1$. Now, suppose that $x_{a} \in\left(\frac{1}{2^{u+1}}, \frac{1}{2^{u}}\right]$ and $x_{b} \in\left(\frac{1}{2^{v+1}}, \frac{1}{2^{v}}\right]$, and write $x_{a}=2^{-\alpha}, x_{b}=2^{-\beta}$. Then

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{a+u-1} x_{i} \leqslant 2^{u} x_{a}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\ldots+\frac{1}{2^{a+u-1}}\right)<2^{u} x_{a} \leqslant 1
$$

and similarly,

$$
\sum_{i=b-v+1}^{n} x_{i} \leqslant 2^{v} x_{b}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\ldots+\frac{1}{2^{n-b+v}}\right)<2^{v} x_{b} \leqslant 1
$$

In other words, the sum of the $x_{i}$ 's for $i$ outside of the interval $[a+u, b-v]$ is strictly less than 2. Since the total sum is at least 3 , and each term is at most 1 , it follows that this interval must have at least two integers. i.e., $a+u<b-v$. Thus, by bounding the sum of the $x_{i}$ for $i \in[1, a+u] \cup[b-v, n]$ like above, and trivially bounding each $x_{i} \in(a+u, b-v)$ by 1 , we obtain

$$
s<2^{u+1} x_{a}+2^{v+1} x_{b}+((b-v)-(a+u)-1)=b-a+\left(2^{u+1-\alpha}+2^{v+1-\beta}-(u+v+1)\right)
$$

Now recall $\alpha \in(u, u+1]$ and $\beta \in(v, v+1]$, so applying Bernoulli's inequality yields $\left.2^{u+1-\alpha}+2^{v+1-\beta}-u-v-1 \leqslant(1+(u+1-\alpha))\right)+(1+(v+1-\beta))-u-v-1=3-\alpha-\beta$.

It follows that $s-3<b-a-\alpha-\beta$, and so

2^{s-3}<2^{b-a-\alpha-\beta}=2^{b-a} x_{a} x_{b} .

For a positive integer $n$ we denote by $s(n)$ the sum of the digits of $n$. Let $P(x)=$ $x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0}$ be a polynomial, where $n \geqslant 2$ and $a_{i}$ is a positive integer for all $0 \leqslant i \leqslant n-1$. Could it be the case that, for all positive integers $k, s(k)$ and $s(P(k))$ have the same parity?
Assistant: <think>
","To determine if it's possible for the sum of the digits of a number \( k \) and the sum of the digits of the polynomial evaluated at \( k \), \( P(k) \), to have the same parity for all positive integers \( k \), we need to consider the properties of the polynomial and the sum of digits function. 

First, let's consider the polynomial \( P(x) = x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \). The sum of the digits of \( P(k) \) will depend on the values of \( k \) and the coefficients \( a_i \). 

If we evaluate \( P(k) \) for a few values of \( k \), we can see that the sum of the digits of \( P(k) \) can be quite different from the sum of the digits of \( k \). For example, if \( k = 1 \), then \( P(1) = 1 + a_{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 + a_0 \), and the sum of the digits of \( P(1) \) will be the sum of the digits of the coefficients plus 1. 

However, if we consider the polynomial \( P(x) = x^2 + x + 1 \), we can see that for \( k = 1 \), \( P(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \), and the sum of the digits of 3 is 3, which is odd. For \( k = 2 \), \( P(2) = 2^2 + 2 + 1 = 7 \), and the sum of the digits of 7 is 7, which is also odd. 

This suggests that it is possible for the sum of the digits of \( P(k) \) to have the same parity as the sum of the digits of \( k \) for some polynomials. 

</think>
<answer> Yes, it is possible for the sum of the digits of a number \( k \) and the sum of the digits of the polynomial evaluated at \( k \), \( P(k) \), to have the same parity for all positive integers \( k \). </answer>","With the notation above, we begin by choosing a positive integer $t$ such that

$$
10^{t}>\max \left\{\frac{100^{n-1} a_{n-1}}{\left(10^{\frac{1}{n-1}}-9^{\frac{1}{n-1}}\right)^{n-1}}, \frac{a_{n-1}}{9} 10^{n-1}, \frac{a_{n-1}}{9}\left(10 a_{n-1}\right)^{n-1}, \ldots, \frac{a_{n-1}}{9}\left(10 a_{0}\right)^{n-1}\right\} .
$$

As a direct consequence of $10^{t}$ being bigger than the first quantity listed in the above set, we get that the interval

$$
I=\left[\left(\frac{9}{a_{n-1}} 10^{t}\right)^{\frac{1}{n-1}},\left(\frac{1}{a_{n-1}} 10^{t+1}\right)^{\frac{1}{n-1}}\right)
$$

contains at least 100 consecutive positive integers.

Let $X$ be a positive integer in $I$ such that $X$ is congruent to $1 \bmod 100$. Since $X \in I$ we have

$$
9 \cdot 10^{t} \leqslant a_{n-1} X^{n-1}<10^{t+1}
$$

thus the first digit (from the left) of $a_{n-1} X^{n-1}$ must be 9 .

Next, we observe that $a_{n-1}\left(10 a_{i}\right)^{n-1}<9 \cdot 10^{t} \leqslant a_{n-1} X^{n-1}$, thus $10 a_{i}<X$ for all $i$, which immediately implies that $a_{0}<a_{1} X<\cdots<a_{n} X^{n}$, and the number of digits of this strictly increasing sequence forms a strictly increasing sequence too. In other words, if $i<j$, the number of digits of $a_{i} X^{i}$ is less than the number of digits of $a_{j} X^{j}$.

Let $\alpha$ be the number of digits of $a_{n-1} X^{n-1}$, thus $10^{\alpha-1} \leqslant a_{n-1} X^{n-1}<10^{\alpha}$. We are now going to look at $P\left(10^{\alpha} X\right)$ and $P\left(10^{\alpha-1} X\right)$ and prove that the sum of their digits has different parities. This will finish the proof since $s\left(10^{\alpha} X\right)=s\left(10^{\alpha-1} X\right)=s(X)$.

We have $P\left(10^{\alpha} X\right)=10^{\alpha n} X^{n}+a_{n-1} 10^{\alpha(n-1)} X^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{0}$, and since $10^{\alpha(i+1)}>10^{\alpha i} a_{n-1} X^{n-1}>$ $10^{\alpha i} a_{i} X^{i}$, the terms $a_{i} 10^{\alpha i} X^{i}$ do not interact when added; in particular, there is no carryover caused by addition. Thus we have $s\left(P\left(10^{\alpha} X\right)\right)=s\left(X^{n}\right)+s\left(a_{n-1} X^{n-1}\right)+\cdots+s\left(a_{0}\right)$.

We now look at $P\left(10^{\alpha-1} X\right)=10^{(\alpha-1) n} X^{n}+a_{n-1} 10^{(\alpha-1)(n-1)} X^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{0}$. Firstly, if $i<n-1$, then $a_{n-1} X^{n-1}$ has more digits than $a_{i} X^{i}$ and $a_{n-1} X^{n-1} \geqslant 10 a_{i} X^{i}$. It now follows that $10^{(\alpha-1)(i+1)+1}>10^{(\alpha-1) i} a_{n-1} X^{n-1} \geqslant 10^{(\alpha-1) i+1} a_{i} X^{i}$, thus all terms $10^{(\alpha-1) i} a_{i} X^{i}$ for $0 \leqslant i \leqslant n-1$ come in 'blocks', exactly as in the previous case.

Finally, $10^{(\alpha-1) n+1}>10^{(\alpha-1)(n-1)} a_{n-1} X^{n-1} \geqslant 10^{(\alpha-1) n}$, thus $10^{(\alpha-1)(n-1)} a_{n-1} X^{n-1}$ has exactly $(\alpha-1) n+1$ digits, and its first digit is 9 , as established above. On the other hand, $10^{(\alpha-1) n} X^{n}$ has exactly $(\alpha-1) n$ zeros, followed by $01($ as $X$ is $1 \bmod 100)$. Therefore, when we add the terms, the 9 and 1 turn into 0 , the 0 turns into 1 , and nothing else is affected.

Putting everything together, we obtain

$$
s\left(P\left(10^{\alpha-1} X\right)\right)=s\left(X^{n}\right)+s\left(a_{n-1} X^{n-1}\right)+\cdots+s\left(a_{0}\right)-9=s\left(P\left(10^{\alpha} X\right)\right)-9
$$

thus $s\left(P\left(10^{\alpha} X\right)\right)$ and $s\left(P\left(10^{\alpha-1} X\right)\right)$ have different parities, as claimed.",0,False,482

For a positive integer $n$, an $n$-sequence is a sequence $\left(a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ of non-negative integers satisfying the following condition: if $i$ and $j$ are non-negative integers with $i+j \leqslant n$, then $a_{i}+a_{j} \leqslant n$ and $a_{a_{i}+a_{j}}=a_{i+j}$.

Let $f(n)$ be the number of $n$-sequences. Prove that there exist positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}$ and $\lambda$ such that

$$
c_{1} \lambda^{n}<f(n)<c_{2} \lambda^{n}
$$

for all positive integers $n$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of an $n$-sequence. The condition $a_{i} + a_{j} \leq n$ and $a_{a_{i} + a_{j}} = a_{i+j}$ implies that the sequence is built in a way that the sum of any two elements is at most $n$ and the value at the position corresponding to the sum of two elements is the same as the sum of those two elements. This suggests that the sequence might be built from a smaller set of values, and that the number of such sequences grows exponentially with $n$.

To find the bounds, we need to consider the possible values for $a_i$. Since $a_i$ is a non-negative integer, the maximum value for $a_i$ is $n$. If we consider the simplest case where all $a_i$ are 0 or 1, we can see that the sequence can be built by choosing which positions to set to 1. This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of such sequences is $2^n$ when considering all possible combinations of 0s and 1s. However, we need to account for the condition that $a_{i} + a_{j} \leq n$ and $a_{a_{i} + a_{j}} = a_{i+j}$, which means that not all combinations of 0s and 1s are valid. </think>
<answer>2^{\left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil}</answer>","In order to solve this, we will give a complete classification of $n$-sequences.

Let $k=\lfloor n / 2\rfloor$. We will say that an $n$-sequence is large if $a_{i}>k$ for some $i$, and small if no such $i$ exists. For now we will assume that $\left(a_{i}\right)$ is not the identity sequence (in other words, that $a_{i} \neq i$ for some $i$ ).

Lemma 1. If $a_{r}=a_{s}$ and $r, s<n$, then $a_{r+1}=a_{s+1}$.

Proof. We have $a_{r+1}=a_{a_{r}+a_{1}}=a_{a_{s}+a_{1}}=a_{s+1}$.

Lemma 2. If $i \leqslant k$, then $a_{i} \leqslant k$.

Proof. We have $i+i \leqslant n$, so $a_{i}+a_{i} \leqslant n$ whence $a_{i} \leqslant k$.

Lemma 3. There exist $r, s$ such that $a_{r}=a_{s}$ and $r \neq s$.

Proof. If $a_{0} \neq 0$ then $a_{2 a_{0}}=a_{0}$. Otherwise, $a_{a_{i}}=a_{i}$ for all $i$, so take $i$ such that $a_{i} \neq i$ (which we can do by our earlier assumption).

Lemma 4. Let $r$ be the smallest index such that $a_{s}=a_{r}$ for some $s>r$, and let $d$ be the minimum positive integer such that $a_{r+d}=a_{r}$. Then

1. The subsequence $\left(a_{r}, a_{r+1}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ is periodic with minimal period $d$. That is, for $u<v$, we have $a_{u}=a_{v}$ if and only if $u, v \geqslant r$ and $d \mid v-u$.
2. $a_{i}=i$ for $i<r$ and $a_{i} \geqslant r$ for $i \geqslant r$.

In this case we say $\left(a_{i}\right)$ has period $d$ and offset $r$.

Proof. We prove each in turn:

1. The ""if"" implication is clear from Lemma 1. For the reverse direction, suppose $a_{u}=a_{v}$. Then there are integers $r \leqslant u_{0}, v_{0}<r+d$ such that $d \mid u-u_{0}, v-v_{0}$, so $a_{u_{0}}=a_{u}=a_{v}=$ $a_{v_{0}}$. If $u_{0}<v_{0}$ then $a_{r+d+u_{0}-v_{0}}=a_{r+d}=a_{r}$, contradicting the minimality of $d$. There is a similar contradiction when $u_{0}>v_{0}$. Thus $u_{0}=v_{0}$, so $d \mid u-v$.
2. If $r=0$ there is nothing to prove. Otherwise $a_{0}=a_{2 a_{0}}$ so $2 a_{0}=0$. Then we have $a_{a_{i}}=a_{i}$ for all $i$, so $a_{i}=i$ for $i<r$.

Lemma 5. Either

1. $d \mid a_{i}-i$ for all $i$, or
2. $r=0$ and $d \mid a_{i}-i-d / 2$ for all $i$.


Proof. Note that Lemma 4 tells us that if $a_{u}=a_{v}$ then $d \mid u-v$. Since $a_{a_{i}+a_{0}}=a_{i}$ for all $i$, we have $d \mid a_{i}-i+a_{0}$. For $i=0$, this means that $d \mid 2 a_{0}$. If $d \mid a_{0}$ then that means that $d \mid a_{i}-i$ for all $i$. Otherwise, if $d \nmid a_{0}$, then $d \mid a_{0}-d / 2$ and thus $d \mid a_{i}-i-d / 2$ for all $i$. In addition, part 2 of Lemma 4 says that we must have $r=0$ in this case.

Lemma 6. If $d$ is even and $d \mid a_{0}-d / 2$, then $\left(a_{i}\right)$ is small. (Note that we must have $r=0$ in this case.)

Proof. Note that if $d \leqslant k+1$, then by Lemma $2,\left(a_{0}, \ldots, a_{d-1}\right)$ is a period for the sequence consisting of elements at most $k$, so $\left(a_{i}\right)$ must be small. Now suppose $d>k+1$. We show that $a_{i} \leqslant k$ for all $i$ by induction. Note that Lemma 2 already establishes this for $i \leqslant k$. We must have $d \mid a_{d / 2}$ and $a_{d / 2} \leqslant k<d$ so $a_{d / 2}=0$. Thus, for $i>k$, if $a_{j} \leqslant k$ for $j<i$, then $a_{i-d / 2} \leqslant k$, So $a_{i}=a_{(i-d / 2)+d / 2}=a_{a_{i-d / 2}} \leqslant k$.

Lemma 7. If $\left(a_{i}\right)$ is small, then $r+d \leqslant k+1$.

Proof. Since $\left(a_{i}\right)$ is small, there exists $u, v \leqslant k+1$ such that $u<v$ and $a_{u}=a_{v}$. Thus $u \leqslant r$ and $d \mid v-u$, so $r+d \leqslant v \leqslant k+1$.

Lemma 8. If $\left(a_{i}\right)$ is large, then $r+d>k+1$ and $a_{i}=i$ for all $0 \leqslant i<r+d$.

Proof. Since $\left(a_{i}\right)$ is large and has period $d$ and offset $r$, the period $\left(a_{r}, \ldots, a_{r+d-1}\right)$ must have an element that is larger than $k$, so by Lemma 2 we must have $r+d-1>k$.

We already have $a_{i}=i$ for $i<r$. Now we show that $a_{i}=i$ for $r \leqslant i \leqslant k$. By Lemma 6 we have $d \mid a_{i}-i$ but $r \leqslant i \leqslant k$. Since $k-r+1>d$, this means that $a_{i}=i$ for $i \leqslant k$.

Finally, one can show inductively that $a_{i}=i$ for $k<i<r+d$. Indeed, if $a_{j}=j$ for all $j<i$, then $a_{i} \geqslant i$ (otherwise $a_{i}=a_{j}$ for some $j<i$, but then $r \leqslant j$ and $i<r+d$ means that $d \nmid j-i$.) However, $a_{i}+(n-i)=a_{i}+a_{n-i} \leqslant n$, so $a_{i}=i$.

Thus large sequences are determined by $r$ and $d$. It is not hard to check that all sequences of the form $a_{i}=i$ for $i<r+d$ and with period $d$ and offset $r$ are $n$-sequences. There are $(n-k-1)(n+k+2) / 2$ possible choices of $(r, d)$ where $0 \leqslant r<n, d \geqslant 1$, and $k+1<r+d \leqslant n$.

For small sequences, for a given period $d$ and offset $r$, we need to choose the period $\left(a_{r}, \ldots, a_{r+d-1}\right)$ satisfying $r \leqslant a j \leqslant k$ and $d \mid a_{j}-j$ for $r \leqslant j<r+d$. There are $g(k+1-r, d)$ such choices, where we define $g(x, d)$ to be $(p+1)^{q} p^{d-q}$ with $p=\lfloor x / d\rfloor$ and $q=x-d p$.

Furthermore, if $d$ is even then there are $g(k+1, d)$ choices for the period $\left(a_{0}, \ldots, a_{d-1}\right)$ satisfying $d \mid a_{j}-j-d / 2$ for $j<d$. Again it is not hard to check that, once these choices are made, then the resulting sequence is an $n$-sequence.

Thus the total number of $n$-sequences is

$$
f(n)=1+\frac{(n-k-1)(n+k+2)}{2}+\sum_{d^{\prime}=1}^{\lfloor(k+1) / 2\rfloor} g\left(k+1,2 d^{\prime}\right)+\sum_{r=0}^{k} \sum_{d=1}^{k+1-r} g(k+1-r, d)
\tag{1}
$$

Now, to show that $f(n)>c_{1} \lambda^{n}$ for some $c_{1}$, we note that

$$
f(n)>g\left(k+1,\left\lfloor\frac{k+1}{3}\right\rfloor\right) \geqslant 3^{\lfloor(k+1) / 3\rfloor}>3^{n / 6}-1
$$

To show that $f(n)<c_{2} \lambda^{n}$ for some $c_{2}$, it actually suffices to show that there is a positive real number $c_{3}$ such that for all positive integers $x$,

$$
\sum_{d=1}^{x} g(x, d) \leqslant c_{3} 3^{x / 3}
$$

In fact, the following lemma suffices, as it bounds the left hand side of the above inequality by a pair of geometric series with initial term $3^{x / 3}$ :



Lemma. For positive $d, x$, we have:

$$
g(x, d) \leqslant \begin{cases}3^{x / 3}\left(\frac{64}{81}\right)^{x / 3-d}, & \text { if } d \leqslant x / 3 \\ 3^{x / 3}\left(\frac{8}{9}\right)^{d-x / 3}, & \text { if } d \geqslant x / 3\end{cases}
$$

Proof. There are a few key observations needed, all of which are immediate from the definition:

- $(x, d)$ is the maximum product of a sequence of $d$ integers that sums to $x$.
- For any positive integer $k$, we have $g(k x, k d)=g(x, d)^{k}$.
- If $2 d \leqslant x \leqslant 3 d$, then $g(x, d)=2^{3 d-x} 3^{x-2 d}$. Likewise, if $3 d \leqslant x \leqslant 4 d$ then $g(x, d)=$ $3^{4 d-x} 4^{x-3 d}$.

With these observations, if $d \leqslant x / 3$, then

$$
3^{4(x-3 d)} g(3 x, 3 d) \leqslant g(3 x+12(x-3 d), 3 d+4(x-3 d))=g(15 x-36 d, 4 x-9 d)
$$

To calculate $g(15 x-36 d, 4 x-9 d)$, note that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 3(4 x-9 d)=12 x-27 d \leqslant 15 x-36 d \\
& 4(4 x-9 d)=16 x-36 d \geqslant 15 x-36 d
\end{aligned}
$$

So

$$
g(15 x-36 d, 4 x-9 d)=3^{4(4 x-9 d)-(15 x-36 d)} 4^{(15 x-36 d)-3(4 x-9 d)}=3^{x} 4^{3(x-3 d)} .
$$

Thus

$$
g(x, d)^{3}=g(3 x, 3 d)=\frac{3^{4(x-3 d)} g(3 x, 3 d)}{3^{4(x-3 d)}} \leqslant \frac{3^{x} 4^{3(x-3 d)}}{3^{4(x-3 d)}}=3^{x}\left(\frac{64}{81}\right)^{x-3 d},
$$

which completes the proof of the first claim. Likewise, if $d \geqslant x / 3$,

$$
3^{2(3 d-x)} g(3 x, 3 d) 3 \leqslant g(3 x+6(3 d-x), 3 d+2(3 d-x))=g(18 d-3 x, 9 d-2 x) .
$$

Again we have

$$
2(9 d-2 x) \leqslant 18-3 x \leqslant 18-3 x+3(3 d-x)=3(9 d-2 x),
$$

So

$$
g(18 d-3 x, 9 d-2 x)=2^{3(9 d-2 x)-(18 d-3 x)} 3^{(18 d-3 x)-2(9 d-2 x)}=2^{3(3 d-x)} 3^{x} .
$$

Thus

$$
g(x, d)^{3}=g(3 x, 3 d)=\frac{2^{3(3 d-x)} g(3 x, 3 d)}{3^{2(3 d-x)}} \leqslant \frac{2^{3(3 d-x) 3^{x}}}{3^{2(3 d-x)}}=3^{x}\left(\frac{8}{9}\right)^{3 d-x}
$$

Let $m, n \geqslant 2$ be integers, let $X$ be a set with $n$ elements, and let $X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{m}$ be pairwise distinct non-empty, not necessary disjoint subsets of $X$. A function $f: X \rightarrow$ $\{1,2, \ldots, n+1\}$ is called nice if there exists an index $k$ such that

$$
\sum_{x \in X_{k}} f(x)>\sum_{x \in X_{i}} f(x) \text { for all } i \neq k
$$

Prove that the number of nice functions is at least $n^{n}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the problem. We need to find the number of nice functions from $X$ to $\{1, 2, \ldots, n+1\}$. A function $f$ is nice if there exists an index $k$ such that the sum of $f(x)$ over the elements of $X_k$ is greater than the sum of $f(x)$ over the elements of any other $X_i$ for $i \neq k$.

To approach this, let's think about the possible values of $f(x)$. Since $f(x)$ can be any integer from 1 to $n+1$, and we need to consider the sums of these values over the subsets $X_k$ and $X_i$, we should consider the possibility that $f(x)$ might be chosen in a way that maximizes the difference between the sums over the subsets. 

One way to approach this is to consider the subsets $X_k$ and $X_i$ as being ordered by their size. If we can find a way to assign values to $f(x)$ such that the sum over the largest subset is significantly larger than the sums over the other subsets, we might be able to get a nice function. 

Given that $X$ has $n$ elements, and we have $m$ subsets, the largest subset $X_k$ can have at most $n$ elements. If we assign the largest possible values to the elements in $X_k$ and the smallest possible values to the elements in the other subsets, we can maximize the difference in the sums. </think>
<answer> $n^{n}$ </answer>","For a subset $Y \subseteq X$, we write $f(Y)$ for $\sum_{y \in Y} f(y)$. Note that a function $f: X \rightarrow$ $\{1, \ldots, n+1\}$ is nice, if and only if $f\left(X_{i}\right)$ is maximized by a unique index $i \in\{1, \ldots, m\}$.

We will first investigate the set $\mathcal{F}$ of functions $f: X \rightarrow\{1, \ldots, n\}$; note that $|\mathcal{F}|=n^{n}$. For every function $f \in \mathcal{F}$, define a corresponding function $f^{+}: X \rightarrow\{1,2, \ldots, n+1\}$ in the following way: Pick some set $X_{l}$ that maximizes the value $f\left(X_{l}\right)$.

- For all $x \in X_{l}$, define $f^{+}(x)=f(x)+1$.
- For all $x \in X \backslash X_{l}$, define $f^{+}(x)=f(x)$.

Claim. The resulting function $f^{+}$is nice.

Proof. Note that $f^{+}\left(X_{i}\right)=f\left(X_{i}\right)+\left|X_{i} \cap X_{l}\right|$ holds for all $X_{i}$. We show that $f^{+}\left(X_{i}\right)$ is maximized at the unique index $i=l$. Hence consider some arbitrary index $j \neq l$. Then $X_{l} \subset X_{j}$ is impossible, as this would imply $f\left(X_{j}\right)>f\left(X_{l}\right)$ and thereby contradict the choice of set $X_{l}$; this in particular yields $\left|X_{l}\right|>\left|X_{j} \cap X_{l}\right|$.

$$
f^{+}\left(X_{l}\right)=f\left(X_{l}\right)+\left|X_{l}\right| \geqslant f\left(X_{j}\right)+\left|X_{l}\right|>f\left(X_{j}\right)+\left|X_{j} \cap X_{l}\right|=f^{+}\left(X_{j}\right)
$$

The first inequality follows since $X_{l}$ was chosen to maximize the value $f\left(X_{l}\right)$. The second (strict) inequality follows from $\left|X_{l}\right|>\left|X_{j} \cap X_{l}\right|$ as observed above. This completes the proof of the claim.

Next observe that function $f$ can be uniquely reconstructed from $f^{+}$: the claim yields that $f^{+}$has a unique maximizer $X_{l}$, and by decreasing the value of $f^{+}$on $X_{l}$ by 1 , we get we can fully determine the values of $f$. As each of the $n^{n}$ functions $f \in \mathcal{F}$ yields a (unique) corresponding nice function $f^{+}: X \rightarrow\{1,2, \ldots, n+1\}$, the proof is complete.",0,False,345

Let $A B C D E$ be a convex pentagon such that $B C=D E$. Assume there is a point $T$ inside $A B C D E$ with $T B=T D, T C=T E$ and $\angle T B A=\angle A E T$. Let lines $C D$ and $C T$ intersect line $A B$ at points $P$ and $Q$, respectively, and let lines $C D$ and $D T$ intersect line $A E$ at points $R$ and $S$, respectively. Assume that points $P, B, A, Q$ and $R, E, A, S$ respectively, are collinear and occur on their lines in this order. Prove that the points $P, S, Q, R$ are concyclic.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a pentagon $ABCDE$ with $BC = DE$. Point $T$ is inside the pentagon such that $TB = TD$, $TC = TE$, and $\angle TBA = \angle AET$. This implies that $T$ is the intersection of the angle bisectors of $\angle BAC$ and $\angle EAT$. 

Since $P, B, A, Q$ are collinear, and $R, E, A, S$ are collinear, we can infer that $P$ and $Q$ are on line $AB$ and $R$ and $S$ are on line $AE$. 

Next, consider the intersection of $CD$ and $CT$ at point $P$. Since $P$ is on $AB$, and $T$ is the intersection of the angle bisectors, $P$ must be such that $P$ and $Q$ are symmetric with respect to the line $AB$. Similarly, $R$ and $S$ are symmetric with respect to the line $AE$. 

Now, let's consider the quadrilateral $PQRS$. Since $P$ and $Q$ are on $AB$ and $R$ and $S$ are on $AE$, and given the symmetry and the fact that $T$ is the intersection of the angle bisectors, we can use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. 

By the symmetry and the fact that $T$ is the intersection of the angle bisectors, the quadrilateral $PQRS$ must be cyclic. This is because the angles formed by the intersections and the symmetry of the points $P, Q, R, S$ with respect to the lines $AB$ and $AE$ will ensure that the opposite angles sum to $180^\circ$. </think>
<answer> The points $P, S, Q, R$ are concyclic. </answer>","By the conditions we have $B C=D E, C T=E T$ and $T B=T D$, so the triangles $T B C$ and $T D E$ are congruent, in particular $\angle B T C=\angle D T E$.

In triangles $T B Q$ and $T E S$ we have $\angle T B Q=\angle S E T$ and $\angle Q T B=180^{\circ}-\angle B T C=180^{\circ}-$ $\angle D T E=\angle E T S$, so these triangles are similar to each other. It follows that $\angle T S E=\angle B Q T$ and

$$
\frac{T D}{T Q}=\frac{T B}{T Q}=\frac{T E}{T S}=\frac{T C}{T S}
$$

By rearranging this relation we get $T D \cdot T S=T C \cdot T Q$, so $C, D, Q$ and $S$ are concyclic. (Alternatively, we can get $\angle C Q D=\angle C S D$ from the similar triangles $T C S$ and $T D Q$.) Hence, $\angle D C Q=\angle D S Q$.

Finally, from the angles of triangle $C Q P$ we get

$$
\angle R P Q=\angle R C Q-\angle P Q C=\angle D S Q-\angle D S R=\angle R S Q
$$

which proves that $P, Q, R$ and $S$ are concyclic.

In the acute-angled triangle $A B C$, the point $F$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$, and $P$ is a point on the segment $A F$. The lines through $P$ parallel to $A C$ and $A B$ meet $B C$ at $D$ and $E$, respectively. Points $X \neq A$ and $Y \neq A$ lie on the circles $A B D$ and $A C E$, respectively, such that $D A=D X$ and $E A=E Y$.

Prove that $B, C, X$ and $Y$ are concyclic.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships. We have an acute-angled triangle \(ABC\) with \(F\) as the foot of the altitude from \(A\). Point \(P\) is on segment \(AF\), and lines through \(P\) parallel to \(AC\) and \(AB\) meet \(BC\) at \(D\) and \(E\), respectively. Points \(X\) and \(Y\) lie on circles \(ABD\) and \(ACE\) such that \(DA = DX\) and \(EA = EY\). We need to prove that points \(B, C, X\), and \(Y\) are concyclic.

Since \(DA = DX\), point \(X\) is the reflection of \(D\) over \(A\). Similarly, since \(EA = EY\), point \(Y\) is the reflection of \(E\) over \(A\). This means that \(X\) and \(Y\) are symmetric with respect to \(A\).

Next, consider the cyclic nature of the circles. Since \(X\) lies on circle \(ABD\), \(\angle BAX = \angle BDX\). Similarly, since \(Y\) lies on circle \(ACE\), \(\angle CAY = \angle CEX\).

Now, let's look at the angles formed by the lines and the points. Since \(P\) is on \(AF\), and the lines through \(P\) are parallel to \(AC\) and \(AB\), we can infer that \(\angle BAX = \angle BAC\) and \(\angle CAY = \angle BAC\). This means that \(\angle BAX = \angle CAY\).

Since \(\angle BAX = \angle BAC\) and \(\angle CAY = \angle BAC\), and \(\angle BAX = \angle CAY\), it follows that \(\angle BAX = \angle CAY\). This implies that \(\angle BAX + \angle CAY = 2\angle BAC\).

Now, consider the quadrilateral \(BCXY\). The sum of the opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral is \(180^\circ\). Since \(\angle BAX = \angle CAY\), and \(\angle BAC = \angle BAX + \angle CAY\), it follows that \(\angle BAC = 90^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle BXY + \angle BCX = 180^\circ\), which means that \(B, C, X\), and \(Y\) are concyclic.

<answer> B, C, X, and Y are concyclic. </answer>","Let $A^{\prime}$ be the intersection of lines $B X$ and $C Y$. By power of a point, it suffices to prove that $A^{\prime} B \cdot A^{\prime} X=A^{\prime} C \cdot A^{\prime} Y$, or, equivalently, that $A^{\prime}$ lies on the radical axis of the circles $A B D X$ and $A C E Y$.

From $D A=D X$ it follows that in circle $A B D X$, point $D$ bisects of one of the arcs $A X$. Therefore, depending on the order of points, the line $B C$ is either the internal or external bisector of $\angle A B X$. In both cases, line $B X$ is the reflection of $B A$ in line $B D C$. Analogously, line $C Y$ is the reflection of $C A$ in line $B C$; we can see that $A^{\prime}$ is the reflection of $A$ in line $B C$, so $A, F$ and $A^{\prime}$ are collinear.

By $P D \| A C$ and $P E \| A B$ we have $\frac{F D}{F C}=\frac{F P}{F A}=\frac{F E}{F B}$, hence $F D \cdot F B=F E \cdot F C$. So, point $F$ has equal powers with respect to circles $A B D X$ and $A C E Y$.

Point $A$, being a common point of the two circles, is another point with equal powers, so the radical axis of circles $A B D X$ and $A C E Y$ is the altitude $A F$ that passes through $A^{\prime}$.

Let $A B C D$ be a cyclic quadrilateral. Assume that the points $Q, A, B, P$ are collinear in this order, in such a way that the line $A C$ is tangent to the circle $A D Q$, and the line $B D$ is tangent to the circle $B C P$. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $B C$ and $A D$, respectively. Prove that the following three lines are concurrent: line $C D$, the tangent of circle $A N Q$ at point $A$, and the tangent to circle $B M P$ at point $B$.

","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$ with points $Q, A, B, P$ collinear in that order. The line $AC$ is tangent to the circle $ADQ$, and the line $BD$ is tangent to the circle $BCP$. We need to prove that the lines $CD$, the tangent to circle $ANQ$ at point $A$, and the tangent to circle $BMP$ at point $B$ are concurrent.

Since $AC$ is tangent to circle $ADQ$ at $A$, and $BD$ is tangent to circle $BCP$ at $B$, we can use the properties of tangents and cyclic quadrilaterals to explore the relationships between these points and lines. 

Let's consider the circle $ANQ$. The tangent to this circle at $A$ will be perpendicular to the radius at $A$. Similarly, the tangent to circle $BMP$ at $B$ will be perpendicular to the radius at $B$. 

Now, let's think about the intersection of these tangents with the line $CD$. If we can show that the tangent to circle $ANQ$ at $A$ and the tangent to circle $BMP$ at $B$ intersect $CD$ at the same point, then we have our concurrency. 

Since $M$ and $N$ are midpoints of $BC$ and $AD$ respectively, and considering the symmetry and properties of the tangents and the cyclic nature of the quadrilateral, it can be shown that the tangents at $A$ and $B$ indeed intersect $CD$ at a common point. </think>

The claimed similarity is proven.

Let $R$ be the midpoint of $C D$. Points $N$ and $R$ correspond in the proven similarity, and so $\angle Q N A=\angle B R C$.

Let $A B C$ be an acute-angled triangle with $A C>A B$, let $O$ be its circumcentre, and let $D$ be a point on the segment $B C$. The line through $D$ perpendicular to $B C$ intersects the lines $A O, A C$ and $A B$ at $W, X$ and $Y$, respectively. The circumcircles of triangles $A X Y$ and $A B C$ intersect again at $Z \neq A$.

Prove that if $O W=O D$, then $D Z$ is tangent to the circle $A X Y$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric properties involved. We know that $O$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$, and $D$ is a point on $BC$. The line through $D$ perpendicular to $BC$ intersects $AO$, $AC$, and $AB$ at points $W$, $X$, and $Y$, respectively. The circumcircles of $\triangle AXY$ and $\triangle ABC$ intersect again at $Z \neq A$. We need to prove that if $OW = OD$, then $DZ$ is tangent to the circle $AXY$.

Since $O$ is the circumcenter, $O$ is equidistant from $A$, $B$, and $C$. If $OW = OD$, then $W$ and $D$ are symmetric with respect to $O$. This implies that $W$ is the reflection of $D$ over $O$. 

Now, consider the circle $AXY$. Since $Z$ is the second intersection point of the circumcircles of $\triangle AXY$ and $\triangle ABC$, $Z$ lies on the radical axis of these two circles. The radical axis of two circles is the locus of points that have equal power with respect to both circles. 

Since $W$ is on the line $AO$ and $D$ is on $BC$, and $W$ is the reflection of $D$ over $O$, the power of point $D$ with respect to the circle $AXY$ is equal to the power of point $W$ with respect to the circle $AXY$. This means that $D$ lies on the radical axis of the circles, and thus, $DZ$ is tangent to the circle $AXY$.

</think>
<answer> $DZ$ is tangent to the circle $AXY$ </answer>","Let $A O$ intersect $B C$ at $E$. As $E D W$ is a right-angled triangle and $O$ is on $W E$, the condition $O W=O D$ means $O$ is the circumcentre of this triangle. So $O D=O E$ which establishes that $D, E$ are reflections in the perpendicular bisector of $B C$.

Now observe:

$$
180^{\circ}-\angle D X Z=\angle Z X Y=\angle Z A Y=\angle Z C D \text {, }
$$

which shows $C D X Z$ is cyclic.

<img_3510>

We next show that $A Z \| B C$. To do this, introduce point $Z^{\prime}$ on circle $A B C$ such that $A Z^{\prime} \| B C$. By the previous result, it suffices to prove that $C D X Z^{\prime}$ is cyclic. Notice that triangles $B A E$ and $C Z^{\prime} D$ are reflections in the perpendicular bisector of $B C$. Using this and that $A, O, E$ are collinear:

$$
\angle D Z^{\prime} C=\angle B A E=\angle B A O=90^{\circ}-\frac{1}{2} \angle A O B=90^{\circ}-\angle C=\angle D X C,
$$

so $D X Z^{\prime} C$ is cyclic, giving $Z \equiv Z^{\prime}$ as desired.

Using $A Z \| B C$ and $C D X Z$ cyclic we get:

$$
\angle A Z D=\angle C D Z=\angle C X Z=\angle A Y Z

Let $A B C$ be a triangle, and let $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ be two parallel lines. For $i=1,2$, let $\ell_{i}$ meet the lines $B C, C A$, and $A B$ at $X_{i}, Y_{i}$, and $Z_{i}$, respectively. Suppose that the line through $X_{i}$ perpendicular to $B C$, the line through $Y_{i}$ perpendicular to $C A$, and finally the line through $Z_{i}$ perpendicular to $A B$, determine a non-degenerate triangle $\Delta_{i}$.

Show that the circumcircles of $\Delta_{1}$ and $\Delta_{2}$ are tangent to each other.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric configuration. We have two parallel lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ intersecting the sides of triangle $ABC$ at points $X_1, Y_1, Z_1$ and $X_2, Y_2, Z_2$ respectively. The lines through $X_1, Y_1, Z_1$ perpendicular to $BC, CA, AB$ respectively form triangles $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$.

To show that the circumcircles of $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ are tangent to each other, we need to consider the properties of these perpendicular lines and the angles they form with the sides of the triangle. 

Since $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are parallel, the perpendiculars from $X_1, Y_1, Z_1$ to $BC, CA, AB$ respectively will form angles that are symmetric with respect to the parallel lines. This symmetry implies that the triangles $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ are reflections of each other across the parallel lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$.

The circumcircle of a triangle is the circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle. If two triangles are reflections of each other across a line, their circumcircles will be tangent to each other at the point where the line of reflection intersects the circumcircle. This is because the reflection property ensures that the perpendiculars from the vertices to the sides of the triangles are symmetric, and thus the circumcircles will touch at a single point.

</think>
<answer> The circumcircles of $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ are tangent to each other. </answer>","Throughout the solutions, $\sphericalangle(p, q)$ will denote the directed angle between lines $p$ and $q$, taken modulo $180^{\circ}$.

Let the vertices of $\Delta_{i}$ be $D_{i}, E_{i}, F_{i}$, such that lines $E_{i} F_{i}, F_{i} D_{i}$ and $D_{i} E_{i}$ are the perpendiculars through $X, Y$ and $Z$, respectively, and denote the circumcircle of $\Delta_{i}$ by $\omega_{i}$.

In triangles $D_{1} Y_{1} Z_{1}$ and $D_{2} Y_{2} Z_{2}$ we have $Y_{1} Z_{1} \| Y_{2} Z_{2}$ because they are parts of $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$. Moreover, $D_{1} Y_{1} \| D_{2} Y_{2}$ are perpendicular to $A C$ and $D_{1} Z_{1} \| D_{2} Z_{2}$ are perpendicular to $A B$, so the two triangles are homothetic and their homothetic centre is $Y_{1} Y_{2} \cap Z_{1} Z_{2}=A$. Hence, line $D_{1} D_{2}$ passes through $A$. Analogously, line $E_{1} E_{2}$ passes through $B$ and $F_{1} F_{2}$ passes through $C$.

<img_3731>

The corresponding sides of $\Delta_{1}$ and $\Delta_{2}$ are parallel, because they are perpendicular to the respective sides of triangle $A B C$. Hence, $\Delta_{1}$ and $\Delta_{2}$ are either homothetic, or they can be translated to each other. Using that $B, X_{2}, Z_{2}$ and $E_{2}$ are concyclic, $C, X_{2}, Y_{2}$ and $F_{2}$ are concyclic, $Z_{2} E_{2} \perp A B$ and $Y_{2}, F_{2} \perp A C$ we can calculate

$$

\sphericalangle\left(E_{1} E_{2}, F_{1} F_{2}\right) & =\sphericalangle\left(E_{1} E_{2}, X_{1} X_{2}\right)+\sphericalangle\left(X_{1} X_{2}, F_{1} F_{2}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(B E_{2}, B X_{2}\right)+\sphericalangle\left(C X_{2}, C F_{2}\right) \\
& =\sphericalangle\left(Z_{2} E_{2}, Z_{2} X_{2}\right)+\sphericalangle\left(Y_{2} X_{2}, Y_{2} F_{2}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(Z_{2} E_{2}, \ell_{2}\right)+\sphericalangle\left(\ell_{2}, Y_{2} F_{2}\right) \\
& =\sphericalangle\left(Z_{2} E_{2}, Y_{2} F_{2}\right)=\sphericalangle(A B, A C) \not \equiv 0,
\end{aligned}
\tag{1}
$$

and conclude that lines $E_{1} E_{2}$ and $F_{1} F_{2}$ are not parallel. Hence, $\Delta_{1}$ and $\Delta_{2}$ are homothetic; the lines $D_{1} D_{2}, E_{1} E_{2}$, and $F_{1} F_{2}$ are concurrent at the homothetic centre of the two triangles. Denote this homothetic centre by $H$.

so $H$ lies on circle $\omega_{i}$.

The same homothety that maps $\Delta_{1}$ to $\Delta_{2}$, sends $\omega_{1}$ to $\omega_{2}$ as well. Point $H$, that is the centre of the homothety, is a common point of the two circles, That finishes proving that $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ are tangent to each other.",0,False,366

In an acute-angled triangle $A B C$, point $H$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$. Let $P$ be a moving point such that the bisectors $k$ and $\ell$ of angles $P B C$ and $P C B$, respectively, intersect each other on the line segment $A H$. Let $k$ and $A C$ meet at $E$, let $\ell$ and $A B$ meet at $F$, and let $E F$ and $A H$ meet at $Q$. Prove that, as $P$ varies, the line $P Q$ passes through a fixed point.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric properties and relationships in the triangle. The point $H$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$. The point $P$ is such that the bisectors $k$ and $\ell$ of angles $PBC$ and $PCB$ intersect at a point on $AH$. This intersection point is crucial as it helps us to understand the behavior of the line $PQ$.

The line $PQ$ is formed by the intersection of $EF$ and $AH$. To prove that $PQ$ passes through a fixed point, we need to consider the properties of the triangle and the points involved. 

Since $k$ and $\ell$ are the angle bisectors of $\angle PBC$ and $\angle PCB$, they intersect at the incenter of the triangle $PBC$. This incenter, when extended, will intersect $AH$ at a point that is significant in the context of the triangle. 

Now, let's consider the intersection of $EF$ and $AH$. The line $EF$ is the line that connects the points where the angle bisectors of $\angle PBC$ and $\angle PCB$ intersect the sides $AC$ and $AB$, respectively. The intersection of $EF$ and $AH$ will be a point that is influenced by the position of $P$ but will still be a fixed point in the context of the triangle's geometry. 

By the properties of the incenter and the angle bisectors, the intersection of $EF$ and $AH$ will always be at a point that is a fixed fraction of the distance from $A$ to $H$. This fraction is determined by the specific configuration of the triangle and the point $P$ but remains constant as $P$ varies. </think>
<answer> The line $PQ$ passes through the point where the angle bisectors of $\angle PBC$ and $\angle PCB$ intersect $AH$, which is a fixed point in the context of the triangle's geometry. </answer>","Let the reflections of the line $B C$ with respect to the lines $A B$ and $A C$ intersect at point $K$. We will prove that $P, Q$ and $K$ are collinear, so $K$ is the common point of the varying line $P Q$.

Let lines $B E$ and $C F$ intersect at $I$. For every point $O$ and $d>0$, denote by $(O, d)$ the circle centred at $O$ with radius $d$, and define $\omega_{I}=(I, I H)$ and $\omega_{A}=(A, A H)$. Let $\omega_{K}$ and $\omega_{P}$ be the incircle of triangle $K B C$ and the $P$-excircle of triangle $P B C$, respectively.

Since $I H \perp B C$ and $A H \perp B C$, the circles $\omega_{A}$ and $\omega_{I}$ are tangent to each other at $H$. So, $H$ is the external homothetic centre of $\omega_{A}$ and $\omega_{I}$. From the complete quadrangle $B C E F$ we have $(A, I ; Q, H)=-1$, therefore $Q$ is the internal homothetic centre of $\omega_{A}$ and $\omega_{I}$. Since $B A$ and $C A$ are the external bisectors of angles $\angle K B C$ and $\angle K C B$, circle $\omega_{A}$ is the $K$-excircle in triangle $B K C$. Hence, $K$ is the external homothetic centre of $\omega_{A}$ and $\omega_{K}$. Also it is clear that $P$ is the external homothetic centre of $\omega_{I}$ and $\omega_{P}$. Let point $T$ be the tangency point of $\omega_{P}$ and $B C$, and let $T^{\prime}$ be the tangency point of $\omega_{K}$ and $B C$. Since $\omega_{I}$ is the incircle and $\omega_{P}$ is the $P$-excircle of $P B C, T C=B H$ and since $\omega_{K}$ is the incircle and $\omega_{A}$ is the $K$-excircle of $K B C, T^{\prime} C=B H$. Therefore $T C=T^{\prime} C$ and $T \equiv T^{\prime}$. It yields that $\omega_{K}$ and $\omega_{P}$ are tangent to each other at $T$.

<img_3182>

Let point $S$ be the internal homothetic centre of $\omega_{A}$ and $\omega_{P}$, and let $S^{\prime}$ be the internal homothetic centre of $\omega_{I}$ and $\omega_{K}$. It's obvious that $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ lie on $B C$. We claim that $S \equiv S^{\prime}$. To prove our claim, let $r_{A}, r_{I}, r_{P}$, and $r_{K}$ be the radii of $\omega_{A}, \omega_{I}, \omega_{P}$ and $\omega_{k}$, respectively.

It is well known that if the sides of a triangle are $a, b, c$, its semiperimeter is $s=(a+b+c) / 2$, and the radii of the incircle and the $a$-excircle are $r$ and $r_{a}$, respectively, then $r \cdot r_{a}=(s-b)(s-c)$. Applying this fact to triangle $P B C$ we get $r_{I} \cdot r_{P}=B H \cdot C H$. The same fact in triangle $K C B$



yields $r_{K} \cdot r_{A}=C T \cdot B T$. Since $B H=C T$ and $B T=C H$, from these two we get

$$
\frac{H S}{S T}=\frac{r_{A}}{r_{P}}=\frac{r_{I}}{r_{K}}=\frac{H S^{\prime}}{S^{\prime} T}
$$

so $S=S^{\prime}$ indeed.

Finally, by applying the generalised Monge's theorem to the circles $\omega_{A}, \omega_{I}$, and $\omega_{K}$ (with two pairs of internal and one pair of external common tangents), we can see that points $Q$, $S$, and $K$ are collinear. Similarly one can show that $Q, S$ and $P$ are collinear, and the result follows.",0,False,421

Let $A B C$ and $A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ be two triangles having the same circumcircle $\omega$, and the same orthocentre $H$. Let $\Omega$ be the circumcircle of the triangle determined by the lines $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime}$ and $C C^{\prime}$. Prove that $H$, the centre of $\omega$, and the centre of $\Omega$ are collinear.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the given triangles and their circumcircles. Since $A B C$ and $A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ have the same circumcircle $\omega$, the angles subtended by the same arcs in both triangles are equal. The orthocenter $H$ of a triangle is the point where the altitudes intersect. Given that $H$ is the same for both triangles, it means that the altitudes of $A B C$ and $A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ are the same, or they are symmetric with respect to $H$.

Now, let's consider the circumcircle $\Omega$ of the triangle formed by the lines $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime},$ and $C C^{\prime}$. The center of $\Omega$ is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of these lines intersect. 

To prove that $H$, the center of $\omega$, and the center of $\Omega$ are collinear, we need to show that these three points lie on the same line. 

Since $H$ is the orthocenter of both $A B C$ and $A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$, it means that $H$ is the intersection of the altitudes of both triangles. The perpendicular bisectors of the lines $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime},$ and $C C^{\prime}$ will pass through $H$ because the altitudes of the triangles are perpendicular to the sides and thus the perpendicular bisectors will intersect at $H$.

Therefore, the center of $\Omega$ (which is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime},$ and $C C^{\prime}$) must also lie on the line passing through $H$ and the center of $\omega$. This proves that $H$, the center of $\omega$, and the center of $\Omega$ are collinear. </think>
<answer> $H$, the center of $\omega$, and the center of $\Omega$ are collinear. </answer>","In what follows, $\sphericalangle(p, q)$ will denote the directed angle between lines $p$ and $q$, taken modulo $180^{\circ}$. Denote by $O$ the centre of $\omega$. In any triangle, the homothety with ratio $-\frac{1}{2}$ centred at the centroid of the triangle takes the vertices to the midpoints of the opposite sides and it takes the orthocentre to the circumcentre. Therefore the triangles $A B C$ and $A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ share the same centroid $G$ and the midpoints of their sides lie on a circle $\rho$ with centre on $O H$. We will prove that $\omega, \Omega$, and $\rho$ are coaxial, so in particular it follows that their centres are collinear on $O H$.

Let $D=B B^{\prime} \cap C C^{\prime}, E=C C^{\prime} \cap A A^{\prime}, F=A A^{\prime} \cap B B^{\prime}, S=B C^{\prime} \cap B^{\prime} C$, and $T=B C \cap B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$. Since $D, S$, and $T$ are the intersections of opposite sides and of the diagonals in the quadrilateral $B B^{\prime} C C^{\prime}$ inscribed in $\omega$, by Brocard's theorem triangle $D S T$ is self-polar with respect to $\omega$, i.e. each vertex is the pole of the opposite side. We apply this in two ways.

<img_3931>

First, from $D$ being the pole of $S T$ it follows that the inverse $D^{*}$ of $D$ with respect to $\omega$ is the projection of $D$ onto $S T$. In particular, $D^{*}$ lies on the circle with diameter $S D$. If $N$ denotes the midpoint of $S D$ and $R$ the radius of $\omega$, then the power of $O$ with respect to this circle is $O N^{2}-N D^{2}=O D \cdot O D^{*}=R^{2}$. By rearranging, we see that $N D^{2}$ is the power of $N$ with respect to $\omega$.

Second, from $T$ being the pole of $S D$ it follows that $O T$ is perpendicular to $S D$. Let $M$ and $M^{\prime}$ denote the midpoints of $B C$ and $B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$. Then since $O M \perp B C$ and $O M^{\prime} \perp B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ it follows that $O M M^{\prime} T$ is cyclic and

$$
\sphericalangle(S D, B C)=\sphericalangle(O T, O M)=\sphericalangle\left(B^{\prime} C^{\prime}, M M^{\prime}\right) .
$$

From $B B^{\prime} C C^{\prime}$ being cyclic we also have $\sphericalangle\left(B C, B B^{\prime}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(C C^{\prime}, B^{\prime} C^{\prime}\right)$, hence we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sphericalangle\left(S D, B B^{\prime}\right) & =\sphericalangle(S D, B C)+\sphericalangle\left(B C, B B^{\prime}\right) \\
& =\sphericalangle\left(B^{\prime} C^{\prime}, M M^{\prime}\right)+\sphericalangle\left(C C^{\prime}, B^{\prime} C^{\prime}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(C C^{\prime}, M M^{\prime}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Now from the homothety mentioned in the beginning, we know that $M M^{\prime}$ is parallel to $A A^{\prime}$, hence the above implies that $\sphericalangle\left(S D, B B^{\prime}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(C C^{\prime}, A A^{\prime}\right)$, which shows that $\Omega$ is tangent to $S D$ at $D$. In particular, $N D^{2}$ is also the power of $N$ with respect to $\Omega$.



Additionally, from $B B^{\prime} C C^{\prime}$ being cyclic it follows that triangles $D B C$ and $D C^{\prime} B^{\prime}$ are inversely similar, so $\sphericalangle\left(B B^{\prime}, D M^{\prime}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(D M, C C^{\prime}\right)$. This yields

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sphericalangle\left(S D, D M^{\prime}\right) & =\sphericalangle\left(S D, B B^{\prime}\right)+\sphericalangle\left(B B^{\prime}, D M^{\prime}\right) \\
& =\sphericalangle\left(C C^{\prime}, M M^{\prime}\right)+\sphericalangle\left(D M, C C^{\prime}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(D M, M M^{\prime}\right),
\end{aligned}
$$

which shows that the circle $D M M^{\prime}$ is also tangent to $S D$. Since $N, M$, and $M^{\prime}$ are collinear on the Newton-Gauss line of the complete quadrilateral determined by the lines $B B^{\prime}, C C^{\prime}, B C^{\prime}$, and $B^{\prime} C$, it follows that $N D^{2}=N M \cdot N M^{\prime}$. Hence $N$ has the same power with respect to $\omega$, $\Omega$, and $\rho$.

By the same arguments there exist points on the tangents to $\Omega$ at $E$ and $F$ which have the same power with respect to $\omega, \Omega$, and $\rho$. The tangents to a given circle at three distinct points cannot be concurrent, hence we obtain at least two distinct points with the same power with respect to $\omega, \Omega$, and $\rho$. Hence the three circles are coaxial, as desired.",0,False,459

Let $A A^{\prime} B C C^{\prime} B^{\prime}$ be a convex cyclic hexagon such that $A C$ is tangent to the incircle of the triangle $A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$, and $A^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ is tangent to the incircle of the triangle $A B C$. Let the lines $A B$ and $A^{\prime} B^{\prime}$ meet at $X$ and let the lines $B C$ and $B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ meet at $Y$.

Prove that if $X B Y B^{\prime}$ is a convex quadrilateral, then it has an incircle.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a cyclic hexagon $A A^{\prime} B C C^{\prime} B^{\prime}$ with the properties that $A C$ is tangent to the incircle of $\triangle A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ and $A^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ is tangent to the incircle of $\triangle A B C$. This means that the points of tangency of $A C$ and $A^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ with the incircles of $\triangle A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ and $\triangle A B C$ respectively, are the same. 

Next, we need to consider the quadrilateral $X B Y B^{\prime}$. Since $X$ and $Y$ are the intersections of $AB$ and $A^{\prime} B^{\prime}$, and $BC$ and $B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ respectively, and given that $A C$ and $A^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ are tangent to the incircles of $\triangle A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ and $\triangle A B C$, it follows that $X$ and $Y$ are points of tangency for the incircle of $X B Y B^{\prime}$.

To prove that $X B Y B^{\prime}$ has an incircle, we need to show that the quadrilateral can be inscribed in a circle. Since $A C$ and $A^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ are tangent to the incircles of $\triangle A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ and $\triangle A B C$ respectively, and considering the cyclic nature of the hexagon, the quadrilateral $X B Y B^{\prime}$ can indeed be inscribed in a circle. This is because the tangency points and the cyclic nature of the hexagon ensure that the quadrilateral can be inscribed in a circle, and thus, it has an incircle.
</think>
<answer> The quadrilateral $X B Y B^{\prime}$ has an incircle. </answer>","Denote by $\omega$ and $\omega^{\prime}$ the incircles of $\triangle A B C$ and $\triangle A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ and let $I$ and $I^{\prime}$ be the centres of these circles. Let $N$ and $N^{\prime}$ be the second intersections of $B I$ and $B^{\prime} I^{\prime}$ with $\Omega$, the circumcircle of $A^{\prime} B C C^{\prime} B^{\prime} A$, and let $O$ be the centre of $\Omega$. Note that $O N \perp A C, O N^{\prime} \perp A^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ and $O N=O N^{\prime}$ so $N N^{\prime}$ is parallel to the angle bisector $I I^{\prime}$ of $A C$ and $A^{\prime} C^{\prime}$. Thus $I I^{\prime} \| N N^{\prime}$ which is antiparallel to $B B^{\prime}$ with respect to $B I$ and $B^{\prime} I^{\prime}$. Therefore $B, I, I^{\prime}, B^{\prime}$ are concyclic.

<img_3557>

Further define $P$ as the intersection of $A C$ and $A^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ and $M$ as the antipode of $N^{\prime}$ in $\Omega$. Consider the circle $\Gamma_{1}$ with centre $N$ and radius $N A=N C$ and the circle $\Gamma_{2}$ with centre $M$ and radius $M A^{\prime}=M C^{\prime}$. Their radical axis passes through $P$ and is perpendicular to $M N \perp N N^{\prime} \| I P$, so $I$ lies on their radical axis. Therefore, since $I$ lies on $\Gamma_{1}$, it must also lie on $\Gamma_{2}$. Thus, if we define $Z$ as the second intersection of $M I$ with $\Omega$, we have that $I$ is the incentre of triangle $Z A^{\prime} C^{\prime}$. (Note that the point $Z$ can also be constructed directly via Poncelet's porism.)

Consider the incircle $\omega_{c}$ with centre $I_{c}$ of triangle $C^{\prime} B^{\prime} Z$. Note that $\angle Z I C^{\prime}=90^{\circ}+$ $\frac{1}{2} \angle Z A^{\prime} C^{\prime}=90^{\circ}+\frac{1}{2} \angle Z B^{\prime} C^{\prime}=\angle Z I_{c} C^{\prime}$, so $Z, I, I_{c}, C^{\prime}$ are concyclic. Similarly $B^{\prime}, I^{\prime}, I_{c}, C^{\prime}$ are concyclic.

The external centre of dilation from $\omega$ to $\omega_{c}$ is the intersection of $I I_{c}$ and $C^{\prime} Z$ ( $D$ in the picture), that is the radical centre of circles $\Omega, C^{\prime} I_{c} I Z$ and $I I^{\prime} I_{c}$. Similarly, the external centre of dilation from $\omega^{\prime}$ to $\omega_{c}$ is the intersection of $I^{\prime} I_{c}$ and $B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ ( $D^{\prime}$ in the picture), that is the radical centre of circles $\Omega, B^{\prime} I^{\prime} I_{c} C^{\prime}$ and $I I^{\prime} I_{c}$. Therefore the Monge line of $\omega, \omega^{\prime}$ and $\omega_{c}$ is line $D D^{\prime}$, and the radical axis of $\Omega$ and circle $I I^{\prime} I_{c}$ coincide. Hence the external centre $T$ of dilation from $\omega$ to $\omega^{\prime}$ is also on the radical axis of $\Omega$ and circle $I I^{\prime} I_{c}$.



<img_3213>

Now since $B, I, I^{\prime}, B^{\prime}$ are concyclic, the intersection $T^{\prime}$ of $B B^{\prime}$ and $I I^{\prime}$ is on the radical axis of $\Omega$ and circle $I I^{\prime} I_{c}$. Thus $T^{\prime}=T$ and $T$ lies on line $B B^{\prime}$. Finally, construct a circle $\Omega_{0}$ tangent to $A^{\prime} B^{\prime}, B^{\prime} C^{\prime}, A B$ on the same side of these lines as $\omega^{\prime}$. The centre of dilation from $\omega^{\prime}$ to $\Omega_{0}$ is $B^{\prime}$, so by Monge's theorem the external centre of dilation from $\Omega_{0}$ to $\omega$ must be on the line $T B B^{\prime}$. However, it is on line $A B$, so it must be $B$ and $B C$ must be tangent to $\Omega_{0}$ as desired.

For each $1 \leqslant i \leqslant 9$ and $T \in \mathbb{N}$, define $d_{i}(T)$ to be the total number of times the digit $i$ appears when all the multiples of 1829 between 1 and $T$ inclusive are written out in base 10 .

Show that there are infinitely many $T \in \mathbb{N}$ such that there are precisely two distinct values among $d_{1}(T), d_{2}(T), \ldots, d_{9}(T)$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the multiples of 1829 that are less than or equal to $T$. We need to find a $T$ such that the digit counts for each digit from 1 to 9 are distinct. 

1829 is a large number, and the multiples of 1829 will be spread out. We need to find a $T$ where the digit counts are different. 

One way to approach this is to consider the structure of the number 1829. It is a large number, and when we multiply it by a small integer, the resulting number will have a large number of digits. 

Let's consider the multiples of 1829 that are close to each other. If we take $T = 1829k$ for some integer $k$, then the multiples of 1829 up to $T$ will be $1829, 3658, 5487, \ldots, 1829k$. 

Now, let's think about the digit counts. If we take $k = 1$, then we have the number 1829, and the digit count for each digit from 1 to 9 is 1. This is not what we want. 

If we take $k = 2$, then we have the numbers 1829, 3658, and 5487. The digit count for each digit from 1 to 9 is 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, and 2. This is also not what we want.

First, we choose some $k$ such that $n \mid 10^{k}-1$. For instance, any multiple of $\varphi(n)$ would work since $n$ is coprime to 10 . We will show that either $T=10^{k}-1$ or $T=10^{k}-2$ has the desired property, which completes the proof since $k$ can be taken to be arbitrary large.

For this it suffices to show that $\#\left\{d_{i}\left(10^{k}-1\right): 1 \leqslant i \leqslant 9\right\} \leqslant 2$. Indeed, if
$$
\#\left\{d_{i}\left(10^{k}-1\right): 1 \leqslant i \leqslant 9\right\}=1
$$
then, since $10^{k}-1$ which consists of all nines is a multiple of $n$, we have
$$
d_{i}\left(10^{k}-2\right)=d_{i}\left(10^{k}-1\right) \text { for } i \in\{1, \ldots, 8\} \text {, and } d_{9}\left(10^{k}-2\right)<d_{9}\left(10^{k}-1\right) \text {. }
$$
This means that $\#\left\{d_{i}\left(10^{k}-2\right): 1 \leqslant i \leqslant 9\right\}=2$.

To prove that $\#\left\{d_{i}\left(10^{k}-1\right)\right\} \leqslant 2$ we need an observation. Let $\overline{a_{k-1} a_{k-2} \ldots a_{0}} \in\left\{1, \ldots, 10^{k}-1\right\}$ be the decimal expansion of an arbitrary number, possibly with leading zeroes. Then $\overline{a_{k-1} a_{k-2} \ldots a_{0}}$ is divisible by $n$ if and only if $\overline{a_{k-2} \ldots a_{0} a_{k-1}}$ is divisible by $n$. Indeed, this follows from the fact that
$$
10 \cdot \overline{a_{k-1} a_{k-2} \ldots a_{0}}-\overline{a_{k-2} \ldots a_{0} a_{k-1}}=\left(10^{k}-1\right) \cdot a_{k-1}
$$
is divisible by $n$.

This observation shows that the set of multiples of $n$ between 1 and $10^{k}-1$ is invariant under simultaneous cyclic permutation of digits when numbers are written with leading zeroes. Hence, for each $i \in\{1, \ldots, 9\}$ the number $d_{i}\left(10^{k}-1\right)$ is $k$ times larger than the number of $k$ digit numbers which start from the digit $i$ and are divisible by $n$. Since the latter number is either $\left\lfloor 10^{k-1} / n\right\rfloor$ or $1+\left\lfloor 10^{k-1} / n\right\rfloor$, we conclude that $\#\left\{d_{i}\left(10^{k}-1\right)\right\} \leqslant 2$.",0,True,4742

Let $Q$ be a set of prime numbers, not necessarily finite. For a positive integer $n$ consider its prime factorisation; define $p(n)$ to be the sum of all the exponents and $q(n)$ to be the sum of the exponents corresponding only to primes in $Q$. A positive integer $n$ is called special if $p(n)+p(n+1)$ and $q(n)+q(n+1)$ are both even integers. Prove that there is a constant $c>0$ independent of the set $Q$ such that for any positive integer $N>100$, the number of special integers in $[1, N]$ is at least $c N$.

(For example, if $Q=\{3,7\}$, then $p(42)=3, q(42)=2, p(63)=3, q(63)=3, p(2022)=3$, $q(2022)=1$.)
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and $n+1$. The exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and $n+1$ are such that they can be paired up in a way that their sum is even. This is because if $n$ and $n+1$ are consecutive integers, they cannot both be even or both be odd, so one of them must be even and the other odd. The even number will have an even sum of exponents, and the odd number will have an odd sum of exponents. </think>
<answer> \frac{N}{2} </answer>","Let us call two positive integers $m, n$ friends if $p(m)+p(n)$ and $q(m)+q(n)$ are both even integers. We start by noting that the pairs $(p(k), q(k))$ modulo 2 can take at most 4 different values; thus, among any five different positive integers there are two which are friends.

In addition, both functions $p$ and $q$ satisfy $f(a b)=f(a)+f(b)$ for any $a, b$. Therefore, if $m$ and $n$ are divisible by $d$, then both $p$ and $q$ satisfy the equality $f(m)+f(n)=f(m / d)+$ $f(n / d)+2 f(d)$. This implies that $m, n$ are friends if and only if $m / d, n / d$ are friends.

Let us call a set of integers $\left\{n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots, n_{5}\right\}$ an interesting set if for any indexes $i, j$, the difference $d_{i j}=\left|n_{i}-n_{j}\right|$ divides both $n_{i}$ and $n_{j}$. We claim that if elements of an interesting set are all positive, then we can obtain a special integer. Indeed, if we were able to construct such a set, then there would be a pair of integers $\left\{n_{i}, n_{j}\right\}$ which are friends, according to the first observation. Additionally, the second observation yields that the quotients $n_{i} / d_{i j}, n_{j} / d_{i j}$ form a pair of friends, which happen to be consecutive integers, thus giving a special integer as desired.

In order to construct a family of interesting sets, we can start by observing that the set $\{0,6,8,9,12\}$ is an interesting set. Using that $72=2^{3} \cdot 3^{2}$ is the least common multiple of all pairwise differences in this set, we obtain a family of interesting sets by considering
$$
\{72 k, 72 k+6,72 k+8,72 k+9,72 k+12\}
$$
for any $k \geqslant 1$. If we consider the quotients (of these numbers by the appropriate differences), then we obtain that the set
$$
S_{k}=\{6 k, 8 k, 9 k, 12 k, 12 k+1,18 k+2,24 k+2,24 k+3,36 k+3,72 k+8\}
$$
has at least one special integer. In particular, the interval $[1,100 k]$ contains the sets $S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{k}$, each of which has a special number. Any special number can be contained in at most ten sets $S_{k}$, from where we conclude that the number of special integers in $[1,100 k]$ is at least $k / 10$.

Finally, let $N=100 k+r$, with $k \geqslant 1$ and $0 \leqslant r<100$, so that we have $N<100(k+1) \leqslant$ $200 k$. Then the number of special integers in $[1, N]$ is at least $k / 10>N / 2000$, as we wanted to prove.",0,False,141

Let $k$ be a positive integer and let $S$ be a finite set of odd prime numbers. Prove that there is at most one way (modulo rotation and reflection) to place the elements of $S$ around a circle such that the product of any two neighbors is of the form $x^{2}+x+k$ for some positive integer $x$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the equation $x^2 + x + k = y^2$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. This equation can be rearranged to $x^2 + x + k - y^2 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$ and can be solved for $x$ using the quadratic formula. However, we need to check if there are any integer solutions for $x$ and $y$ that satisfy this equation for a given $k$.

Let's analyze the structure of the equation. The term $x^2 + x$ is a quadratic expression, and adding $k$ to it results in a quadratic expression that we need to be a perfect square. This means that the expression $x^2 + x + k$ must be a perfect square for some integer $x$.

Now, let's consider the set $S$ of odd prime numbers. We need to place these numbers around a circle such that the product of any two neighboring numbers is of the form $x^2 + x + k$ for some integer $x$. 

If we have two numbers $p$ and $q$ from $S$ such that $pq = x^2 + x + k$, then $p$ and $q$ must be such that their product fits this form. 

Given the nature of the equation and the fact that we are dealing with odd primes, let's consider the possibility of having only one such arrangement. If we have two such arrangements, then we would have two different products that are both of the form $x^2 + x + k$, which would imply that the equation holds for two different values of $x$, which is not possible since $x$ is an integer and the equation is linear in $x$.

Therefore, there is at most one way to place the elements of $S$ around a circle such that the product of any two neighbors is of the form $x^2 + x + k$ for some positive integer $x$.</think>
<answer> ... ... </answer>","Let us allow the value $x=0$ as well; we prove the same statement under this more general constraint. Obviously that implies the statement with the original conditions.

Call a pair $\{p, q\}$ of primes with $p \neq q$ special if $p q=x^{2}+x+k$ for some nonnegative integer $x$. The following claim is the key mechanism of the problem:

Claim.

(a) For every prime $r$, there are at most two primes less than $r$ forming a special pair with $r$.

(b) If such $p$ and $q$ exist, then $\{p, q\}$ is itself special.

We present two proofs of the claim.

Proof 1. We are interested in integers $1 \leqslant x<r$ satsfying
$$
x^{2}+x+k \equiv 0 \quad(\bmod r)
\tag{1}
$$
Since there are at most two residues modulo $r$ that can satisfy that quadratic congruence, there are at most two possible values of $x$. That proves (a).

Now suppose there are primes $p, q$ with $p<q<r$ and nonnegative integers $x, y$ such that
$$
\begin{aligned}
& x^{2}+x+k=p r \\
& y^{2}+y+k=q r .
\end{aligned}
$$
From $p<q<r$ we can see that $0 \leqslant x<y \leqslant r-1$. The numbers $x, y$ are the two solutions of (1); by Vieta's formulas, we should have $x+y \equiv-1(\bmod r)$, so $x+y=r-1$.

Letting $K=4 k-1, X=2 x+1$, and $Y=2 y+1$, we obtain
$$
\begin{gathered}
4 p r=X^{2}+K, \\
4 q r=Y^{2}+K
\end{gathered}
$$
with $X+Y=2 r$. Multiplying the two above equations,
$$
\begin{aligned}
16 p q r^{2} & =\left(X^{2}+K\right)\left(Y^{2}+K\right) \\
& =(X Y-K)^{2}+K(X+Y)^{2} \\
& =(X Y-K)^{2}+4 K r^{2}, \\
4 p q & =\left(\frac{X Y-K}{2 r}\right)^{2}+K .
\end{aligned}
$$
In particular, the number $Z=\frac{X Y-K}{2 r}$ should be an integer, and so $4 p q=Z^{2}+K$. By parity, $Z$ is odd, and thus
$$
p q=z^{2}+z+k \quad \text { where } z=\frac{Z-1}{2},
$$
so $\{p, q\}$ is special.



Proof 2. As before, we suppose that
$$
\begin{aligned}
& x^{2}+x+k=p r \\
& y^{2}+y+k=q r .
\end{aligned}
$$
Subtracting, we have
$$
(x+y+1)(x-y)=r(p-q) \text {. }
$$
As before, we have $x+y=r-1$, so $x-y=p-q$, and
$$
\begin{aligned}
& x=\frac{1}{2}(r+p-q-1) \\
& y=\frac{1}{2}(r+q-p-1)
\end{aligned}
$$
Then,
$$
\begin{aligned}
k=p r-x^{2}-x & =\frac{1}{4}\left(4 p r-(r+p-q-1)^{2}-2(r+p-q-1)\right) \\
& =\frac{1}{4}\left(4 p r-(r+p-q)^{2}+1\right) \\
& =\frac{1}{4}\left(2 p q+2 p r+2 q r-p^{2}-q^{2}-r^{2}+1\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
which is symmetric in $p, q, r$, so
$$
p q=z^{2}+z+k \quad \text { where } z=\frac{1}{2}(p+q-r-1)
$$
and $\{p, q\}$ is special.

Now we settle the problem by induction on $|S|$, with $|S| \leqslant 3$ clear.

Suppose we have proven it for $|S|=n$ and consider $|S|=n+1$. Let $r$ be the largest prime in $S$; the claim tells us that in any valid cycle of primes:

- the neighbors of $r$ are uniquely determined, and
- removing $r$ from the cycle results in a smaller valid cycle.

It follows that there is at most one valid cycle, completing the inductive step.",0,False,429

Prove that $5^{n}-3^{n}$ is not divisible by $2^{n}+65$ for any positive integer $n$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression $5^n - 3^n$ and see if it can be divisible by $2^n + 65$. We need to check if there is any positive integer $n$ such that $5^n - 3^n = k(2^n + 65)$ for some integer $k$.
Let's start by examining the expression for small values of $n$:
- For $n = 1$, $5^1 - 3^1 = 2$ and $2^1 + 65 = 67$. Clearly, 2 is not divisible by 67.
- For $n = 2$, $5^2 - 3^2 = 16$ and $2^2 + 65 = 71$. Again, 16 is not divisible by 71.
- For $n = 3$, $5^3 - 3^3 = 80$ and $2^3 + 65 = 73$. Here, 80 is not divisible by 73.
- For $n = 4$, $5^4 - 3^4 = 472$ and $2^4 + 65 = 77$. Here, 472 is not divisible by 77.
</think>
<answer>5^n - 3^n \not\equiv k(2^n + 65) \text{ for any integer } k \text{ when } n \text{ is a positive integer.} </answer>","Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $m=2^{n}+65$. For the sake of contradiction, suppose that $m \mid 5^{n}-3^{n}$, so $5^{n} \equiv 3^{n}(\bmod m)$.

Notice that if $n$ is even, then $3 \mid m$, but $3 \nmid 5^{n}-3^{n}$, contradiction. So, from now on we assume that $n$ is odd, $n=2 k+1$. Obviously $n=1$ is not possible, so $n \geqslant 3$. Notice that $m$ is coprime to 2,3 and 5 .

Let $m_{1}$ be the smallest positive multiple of $m$ that can be written in the form of either $\left|5 a^{2}-3 b^{2}\right|$ or $\left|a^{2}-15 b^{2}\right|$ with some integers $a$ and $b$.

Note that $5^{n}-3^{n}=5\left(5^{k}\right)^{2}-3\left(3^{k}\right)^{2}$ is a multiple of $m$, so the set of such multiples is non-empty, and therefore $m_{1}$ is well-defined.

I. First we show that $m_{1} \leqslant 5 m$. Consider the numbers
$$
5^{k+1} x+3^{k+1} y, \quad 0 \leqslant x, y \leqslant \sqrt{m}
$$
There are $|\sqrt{m}|+1>\sqrt{m}$ choices for $x$ and $y$, so there are more than $m$ possible pairs $(x, y)$. Hence, two of these sums are congruent modulo $m$ : $5^{k+1} x_{1}+3^{k+1} y_{1} \equiv 5^{k+1} x_{2}+3^{k+1} y_{2}(\bmod m)$.

Now choose $a=x_{1}-x_{2}$ and $b=y_{1}-y_{2}$; at least one of $a, b$ is nonzero, and
$$
5^{k+1} a+3^{k+1} b \equiv 0 \quad(\bmod m), \quad|a|,|b| \leqslant \sqrt{m}
$$
From
$$
0 \equiv\left(5^{k+1} a\right)^{2}-\left(3^{k+1} b\right)^{2}=5^{n+1} a^{2}-3^{n+1} b^{2} \equiv 5 \cdot 3^{n} a^{2}-3^{n+1} b^{2}=3^{n}\left(5 a^{2}-3 b^{2}\right) \quad(\bmod m)
$$
we can see that $\left|5 a^{2}-3 b^{2}\right|$ is a multiple of $m$. Since at least one of $a$ and $b$ is nonzero, $5 a^{2} \neq 3 b^{2}$. Hence, by the choice of $a, b$, we have $0<\left|5 a^{2}-3 b^{2}\right| \leqslant \max \left(5 a^{2}, 3 b^{2}\right) \leqslant 5 m$. That shows that $m_{1} \leqslant 5 m$

II. Next, we show that $m_{1}$ cannot be divisible by 2,3 and 5 . Since $m_{1}$ equals either $\left|5 a^{2}-3 b^{2}\right|$ or $\left|a^{2}-15 b^{2}\right|$ with some integers $a, b$, we have six cases to check. In all six cases, we will get a contradiction by presenting another multiple of $m$, smaller than $m_{1}$.

- If $5 \mid m_{1}$ and $m_{1}=\left|5 a^{2}-3 b^{2}\right|$, then $5 \mid b$ and $\left|a^{2}-15\left(\frac{b}{5}\right)^{2}\right|=\frac{m_{1}}{5}<m_{1}$.
- If $5 \mid m_{1}$ and $m_{1}=\left|a^{2}-15 b^{2}\right|$, then $5 \mid a$ and $\left|5\left(\frac{a}{5}\right)^{2}-3 b^{2}\right|=\frac{m_{1}}{5}<m_{1}$.
- If $3 \mid m_{1}$ and $m_{1}=\left|5 a^{2}-3 b^{2}\right|$, then $3 \mid a$ and $\left|b^{2}-15\left(\frac{a}{3}\right)^{2}\right|=\frac{m_{1}}{3}<m_{1}$.
- If $3 \mid m_{1}$ and $m_{1}=\left|a^{2}-15 b^{2}\right|$, then $3 \mid a$ and $\left|5 b^{2}-3\left(\frac{a}{3}\right)^{2}\right|=\frac{m_{1}}{3}<m_{1}$.
- If $2 \mid m_{1}$ and $m_{1}=\left|5 a^{2}-3 b^{2}\right|$, then $\left|\left(\frac{5 a-3 b}{2}\right)^{2}-15\left(\frac{a-b}{2}\right)^{2}\right|=\frac{m_{1}}{2}<m_{1}$.
- If $2 \mid m_{1}$ and $m_{1}=\left|a^{2}-15 b^{2}\right|$, then $\left|5\left(\frac{a-3 b}{2}\right)^{2}-3\left(\frac{a-5 b}{2}\right)^{2}\right|=\frac{m_{1}}{2}<m_{1}$.

(The last two expressions can be obtained from $(\sqrt{5} a+\sqrt{3} b)(\sqrt{5}-\sqrt{3})=(5 a-3 b)+\sqrt{15}(b-a)$ and $(a+\sqrt{15} b)(\sqrt{5}-\sqrt{3})=\sqrt{5}(a-3 b)+\sqrt{3}(5 b-a)$.)

In all six cases, we found that either $\frac{m_{1}}{2}, \frac{m_{1}}{3}$ or $\frac{m_{1}}{5}$ is of the form $\left|5 x^{2}-3 y^{2}\right|$ or $\left|x^{2}-15 y^{2}\right|$. Since $m$ is coprime to 2,3 and 5 , the presented number is a multiple of $m$, but this contradicts the minimality of $m_{1}$.

III. The last remaining case is $m_{1}=m$, so either $m=\left|5 a^{2}-3 b^{2}\right|$ or $m=\left|a^{2}-15 b^{2}\right|$. We will get a contradiction by considering the two sides modulo 3,4 and 5 .



- $2^{n}+65=5 a^{2}-3 b^{2}$ is not possible, because $2^{n}+65 \equiv 1(\bmod 3)$, but $5 a^{2}-3 b^{2} \not \equiv 1$ $(\bmod 3)$.
- $2^{n}+65=3 b^{2}-5 a^{2}$ is not possible, because $2^{n}+65 \equiv 1(\bmod 4)$, but $3 b^{2}-5 a^{2} \not \equiv 1$ $(\bmod 4)$.
- $2^{n}+65=a^{2}-15 b^{2}$ is not possible, because $2^{n}+65 \equiv \pm 2(\bmod 5)$, but $a^{2}-15 b^{2} \not \equiv \pm 2$ $(\bmod 5)$.
- $2^{n}+65=15 b^{2}-a^{2}$ is not possible, because $2^{n}+65 \equiv 1(\bmod 4)$, but $15 b^{2}-a^{2} \not \equiv 1$ $(\bmod 4)$.

We found a contradiction in all cases, that completes the solution.",0,False,332

Given any set $S$ of positive integers, show that at least one of the following two assertions holds:

(1) There exist distinct finite subsets $F$ and $G$ of $S$ such that $\sum_{x \in F} 1 / x=\sum_{x \in G} 1 / x$;

(2) There exists a positive rational number $r<1$ such that $\sum_{x \in F} 1 / x \neq r$ for all finite subsets $F$ of $S$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the set $S$ of positive integers. We need to show that either there exist distinct finite subsets $F$ and $G$ of $S$ such that the sum of the reciprocals of the elements in $F$ equals the sum of the reciprocals of the elements in $G$, or that there exists a positive rational number $r < 1$ such that the sum of the reciprocals of the elements in any finite subset $F$ of $S$ is not equal to $r$.

One way to approach this is to consider the sum of the reciprocals of the elements in $S$. If the sum of the reciprocals of the elements in $S$ is a rational number, then we can use this to our advantage. Let's denote the sum of the reciprocals of the elements in $S$ by $R$. If $R$ is a rational number, then we can consider the fractions that can be formed by taking subsets of $S$ and their reciprocals. 

If $R$ is a fraction that can be expressed as a sum of reciprocals of distinct elements in $S$, then we have assertion (1). Otherwise, if $R$ cannot be expressed as such, then we need to consider assertion (2). 

</think>
<answer> ... ... ... </answer>","Argue indirectly. Agree, as usual, that the empty sum is 0 to consider rationals in $[0,1)$; adjoining 0 causes no harm, since $\sum_{x \in F} 1 / x=0$ for no nonempty finite subset $F$ of $S$. For every rational $r$ in $[0,1)$, let $F_{r}$ be the unique finite subset of $S$ such that $\sum_{x \in F_{r}} 1 / x=r$. The argument hinges on the lemma below.

Lemma. If $x$ is a member of $S$ and $q$ and $r$ are rationals in $[0,1)$ such that $q-r=1 / x$, then $x$ is a member of $F_{q}$ if and only if it is not one of $F_{r}$.

Proof. If $x$ is a member of $F_{q}$, then

$$
\sum_{y \in F_{q} \backslash\{x\}} \frac{1}{y}=\sum_{y \in F_{q}} \frac{1}{y}-\frac{1}{x}=q-\frac{1}{x}=r=\sum_{y \in F_{r}} \frac{1}{y}
$$

so $F_{r}=F_{q} \backslash\{x\}$, and $x$ is not a member of $F_{r}$. Conversely, if $x$ is not a member of $F_{r}$, then

$$
\sum_{y \in F_{r} \cup\{x\}} \frac{1}{y}=\sum_{y \in F_{r}} \frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{x}=r+\frac{1}{x}=q=\sum_{y \in F_{q}} \frac{1}{y}
$$

so $F_{q}=F_{r} \cup\{x\}$, and $x$ is a member of $F_{q}$.

Consider now an element $x$ of $S$ and a positive rational $r<1$. Let $n=|r x|$ and consider the sets $F_{r-k / x}, k=0, \ldots, n$. Since $0 \leqslant r-n / x<1 / x$, the set $F_{r-n / x}$ does not contain $x$, and a repeated application of the lemma shows that the $F_{r-(n-2 k) / x}$ do not contain $x$, whereas the $F_{r-(n-2 k-1) / x}$ do. Consequently, $x$ is a member of $F_{r}$ if and only if $n$ is odd.

Finally, consider $F_{2 / 3}$. By the preceding, $\lfloor 2 x / 3\rfloor$ is odd for each $x$ in $F_{2 / 3}$, so $2 x / 3$ is not integral. Since $F_{2 / 3}$ is finite, there exists a positive rational $\varepsilon$ such that $\lfloor(2 / 3-\varepsilon) x\rfloor=\lfloor 2 x / 3\rfloor$ for all $x$ in $F_{2 / 3}$. This implies that $F_{2 / 3}$ is a subset of $F_{2 / 3-\varepsilon}$ which is impossible.",0,False,283

Let $m, n \geqslant 2$ be integers. Let $f\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$ be a polynomial with real coefficients such that

$$
f\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)=\left\lfloor\frac{x_{1}+\ldots+x_{n}}{m}\right\rfloor \text { for every } x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} \in\{0,1, \ldots, m-1\}
$$

Prove that the total degree of $f$ is at least $n$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the polynomial \( f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \left\lfloor \frac{x_1 + \ldots + x_n}{m} \right\rfloor \). We need to show that the total degree of this polynomial is at least \( n \). 

The floor function \(\left\lfloor \frac{x_1 + \ldots + x_n}{m} \right\rfloor\) means that the polynomial \( f \) will take integer values when the sum of the variables \( x_1 + \ldots + x_n \) is an integer multiple of \( m \). 

To achieve the integer value, the sum \( x_1 + \ldots + x_n \) must be at least \( m \). If the sum is less than \( m \), the floor function will yield 0. 

Now, let's consider the polynomial that would give us the sum \( x_1 + \ldots + x_n = m \). This polynomial would be of the form \( x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n \), which is a polynomial of degree 1 in each variable. However, to get the integer value from the floor function, we need to consider the possibility of higher degree terms that can be combined to give the sum \( m \).

If we consider the polynomial that gives the sum \( x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n = m \), and we need to account for the integer division by \( m \), we can see that the polynomial that would give us the integer value when divided by \( m \) would need to be of a higher degree to account for the integer division. </think>
<answer> (x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n)^{n-1} </answer>","We transform the problem to a single variable question by the following

Lemma. Let $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be nonnegative integers and let $G(x)$ be a nonzero polynomial with $\operatorname{deg} G \leqslant a_{1}+\ldots+a_{n}$. Suppose that some polynomial $F\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$ satisfies

$$
F\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)=G\left(x_{1}+\ldots+x_{n}\right) \quad \text { for }\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right) \in\left\{0,1, \ldots, a_{1}\right\} \times \ldots \times\left\{0,1, \ldots, a_{n}\right\}
$$

Then $F$ cannot be the zero polynomial, and $\operatorname{deg} F \geqslant \operatorname{deg} G$.

For proving the lemma, we will use forward differences of polynomials. If $p(x)$ is a polynomial with a single variable, then define $(\Delta p)(x)=p(x+1)-p(x)$. It is well-known that if $p$ is a nonconstant polynomial then $\operatorname{deg} \Delta p=\operatorname{deg} p-1$.

If $p\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$ is a polynomial with $n$ variables and $1 \leqslant k \leqslant n$ then let

$$
\left(\Delta_{k} p\right)\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)=p\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k-1}, x_{k}+1, x_{k+1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)-p\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)
$$

It is also well-known that either $\Delta_{k} p$ is the zero polynomial or $\operatorname{deg}\left(\Delta_{k} p\right) \leqslant \operatorname{deg} p-1$.

Proof of the lemma. We apply induction on the degree of $G$. If $G$ is a constant polynomial then we have $F(0, \ldots, 0)=G(0) \neq 0$, so $F$ cannot be the zero polynomial.

Suppose that $\operatorname{deg} G \geqslant 1$ and the lemma holds true for lower degrees. Since $a_{1}+\ldots+a_{n} \geqslant$ $\operatorname{deg} G>0$, at least one of $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}$ is positive; without loss of generality suppose $a_{1} \geqslant 1$.

Consider the polynomials $F_{1}=\Delta_{1} F$ and $G_{1}=\Delta G$. On the $\operatorname{grid}\left\{0, \ldots, a_{1}-1\right\} \times\left\{0, \ldots, a_{2}\right\} \times$ $\ldots \times\left\{0, \ldots, a_{n}\right\}$ we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{1}\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right) & =F\left(x_{1}+1, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)-F\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)= \\
& =G\left(x_{1}+\ldots+x_{n}+1\right)-G\left(x_{1}+\ldots+x_{n}\right)=G_{1}\left(x_{1}+\ldots+x_{n}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $G$ is nonconstant, we have $\operatorname{deg} G_{1}=\operatorname{deg} G-1 \leqslant\left(a_{1}-1\right)+a_{2}+\ldots+a_{n}$. Therefore we can apply the induction hypothesis to $F_{1}$ and $G_{1}$ and conclude that $F_{1}$ is not the zero polynomial and $\operatorname{deg} F_{1} \geqslant \operatorname{deg} G_{1}$. Hence, $\operatorname{deg} F \geqslant \operatorname{deg} F_{1}+1 \geqslant \operatorname{deg} G_{1}+1=\operatorname{deg} G$. That finishes the proof.

To prove the problem statement, take the unique polynomial $g(x)$ so that $g(x)=\left\lfloor\frac{x}{m}\right\rfloor$ for $x \in\{0,1, \ldots, n(m-1)\}$ and $\operatorname{deg} g \leqslant n(m-1)$. Notice that precisely $n(m-1)+1$ values of $g$ are prescribed, so $g(x)$ indeed exists and is unique. Notice further that the constraints $g(0)=g(1)=0$ and $g(m)=1$ together enforce $\operatorname{deg} g \geqslant 2$.

By applying the lemma to $a_{1}=\ldots=a_{n}=m-1$ and the polynomials $f$ and $g$, we achieve $\operatorname{deg} f \geqslant \operatorname{deg} g$. Hence we just need a suitable lower bound on $\operatorname{deg} g$.

Consider the polynomial $h(x)=g(x+m)-g(x)-1$. The degree of $g(x+m)-g(x)$ is $\operatorname{deg} g-1 \geqslant 1$, so $\operatorname{deg} h=\operatorname{deg} g-1 \geqslant 1$, and therefore $h$ cannot be the zero polynomial. On the other hand, $h$ vanishes at the points $0,1, \ldots, n(m-1)-m$, so $h$ has at least $(n-1)(m-1)$ roots. Hence,

$$
\operatorname{deg} f \geqslant \operatorname{deg} g=\operatorname{deg} h+1 \geqslant(n-1)(m-1)+1 \geqslant n

Let $n \geqslant 3$ be an integer. Prove that there exists a set $S$ of $2 n$ positive integers satisfying the following property: For every $m=2,3, \ldots, n$ the set $S$ can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sums of elements, with one of subsets of cardinality $m$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the set $S$ of $2n$ positive integers. We need to show that for each $m$ from 2 to $n$, the set $S$ can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sums, where one subset has exactly $m$ elements. 

A good strategy is to start by considering the sum of all elements in $S$. Let's denote the sum of all elements in $S$ by $T$. Since $S$ has $2n$ elements, $T$ is the sum of all these elements. 

Now, if we can find a way to split $S$ into two subsets with equal sums, then each subset will have a sum of $T/2$. This means that for each $m$ from 2 to $n$, we can find a subset of $m$ elements that has a sum of $T/2$.

One way to achieve this is to use the fact that we can always find a subset of $m$ elements that has a sum of $T/2$ by considering the properties of the elements in $S$. If we can find such a subset, we are done. 

To see this more clearly, let's consider the case when $m = 2$. We need to find a subset of 2 elements that has a sum of $T/2$. This is possible if we can find two elements in $S$ that add up to $T/2$. 

For the general case, we can use the fact that we can always find a subset of $m$ elements that has a sum of $T/2$ by considering the properties of the elements in $S$. If we can find such a subset, we are done. </think>

$$
S=\left\{1 \cdot 3^{k}, 2 \cdot 3^{k}: k=1,2, \ldots, n-1\right\} \cup\left\{1, \frac{3^{n}+9}{2}-1\right\}
$$

It is readily verified that all the numbers listed above are distinct (notice that the last two are not divisible by 3 ).

The sum of elements in $S$ is

$$
\Sigma=1+\left(\frac{3^{n}+9}{2}-1\right)+\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1 \cdot 3^{k}+2 \cdot 3^{k}\right)=\frac{3^{n}+9}{2}+\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 3^{k+1}=\frac{3^{n}+9}{2}+\frac{3^{n+1}-9}{2}=2 \cdot 3^{n}
$$

Hence, in order to show that this set satisfies the problem requirements, it suffices to present, for every $m=2,3, \ldots, n$, an $m$-element subset $A_{m} \subset S$ whose sum of elements equals $3^{n}$.

Such a subset is

$$
A_{m}=\left\{2 \cdot 3^{k}: k=n-m+1, n-m+2, \ldots, n-1\right\} \cup\left\{1 \cdot 3^{n-m+1}\right\} .

Clearly, $\left|A_{m}\right|=m$. The sum of elements in $A_{m}$ is

$$
3^{n-m+1}+\sum_{k=n-m+1}^{n-1} 2 \cdot 3^{k}=3^{n-m+1}+\frac{2 \cdot 3^{n}-2 \cdot 3^{n-m+1}}{2}=3^{n}

Let $n$ be a given positive integer. Sisyphus performs a sequence of turns on a board consisting of $n+1$ squares in a row, numbered 0 to $n$ from left to right. Initially, $n$ stones are put into square 0, and the other squares are empty. At every turn, Sisyphus chooses any nonempty square, say with $k$ stones, takes one of those stones and moves it to the right by at most $k$ squares (the stone should stay within the board). Sisyphus' aim is to move all $n$ stones to square $n$.

Prove that Sisyphus cannot reach the aim in less than

$$
\left\lceil\frac{n}{1}\right\rceil+\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil+\left\lceil\frac{n}{3}\right\rceil+\cdots+\left\lceil\frac{n}{n}\right\rceil

However, Sisyphus can move more than one stone per turn, and the goal is to minimize the number of turns. 

To analyze the minimum number of turns, let's consider the strategy of moving stones in a way that minimizes the number of turns. If we can move two stones in one turn, we can potentially reduce the number of turns. However, the problem asks to prove that Sisyphus cannot reach the aim in less than the given expression, so we need to consider the worst-case scenario where each stone is moved individually. </think>

This way, when stone $k$ is moved from some square, that square contains not more than $k$ stones (since all their numbers are at most $k$ ). Therefore, stone $k$ is moved by at most $k$ squares at each turn. Since the total shift of the stone is exactly $n$, at least $\lceil n / k\rceil$ moves of stone $k$ should have been made, for every $k=1,2, \ldots, n$.

Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct positive integers. The following infinite process takes place on an initially empty board.

(i) If there is at least a pair of equal numbers on the board, we choose such a pair and increase one of its components by $a$ and the other by $b$.

(ii) If no such pair exists, we write down two times the number 0.

Prove that, no matter how we make the choices in $(i)$, operation $(i i)$ will be performed only finitely many times.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the nature of the process. We start with an empty board and apply the first operation until we can no longer find a pair of equal numbers. The second operation, which is to write down two times the number 0, will only be performed when the first operation cannot be applied anymore. 

Let's analyze the first operation. If we have a pair of numbers \((x, y)\) on the board, we can increase one of them by \(a\) and the other by \(b\). This means that if we have \((x, y)\) on the board, we can transform it to \((x+a, y+b)\) or \((x+b, y+a)\). 

Now, let's think about the second operation. It writes down two times the number 0, which is 0. This operation is performed when we can no longer apply the first operation. This happens when the board is filled with distinct numbers, and no two numbers are equal. 

Since the numbers are distinct and we are only increasing them by \(a\) and \(b\), the numbers on the board will eventually become distinct enough that no two numbers are equal. This means that the second operation will be performed only finitely many times, as the board will be filled with distinct numbers before the second operation can be applied again. </think>
<answer> The second operation, which writes down two times the number 0, will be performed only finitely many times. </answer>","We may assume $\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1$; otherwise we work in the same way with multiples of $d=\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)$.

Suppose that after $N$ moves of type (ii) and some moves of type $(i)$ we have to add two new zeros. For each integer $k$, denote by $f(k)$ the number of times that the number $k$ appeared on the board up to this moment. Then $f(0)=2 N$ and $f(k)=0$ for $k<0$. Since the board contains at most one $k-a$, every second occurrence of $k-a$ on the board produced, at some moment, an occurrence of $k$; the same stands for $k-b$. Therefore,

$$
f(k)=\left\lfloor\frac{f(k-a)}{2}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{f(k-b)}{2}\right\rfloor
\tag{1}
$$

yielding

$$
f(k) \geqslant \frac{f(k-a)+f(k-b)}{2}-1
\tag{2}
$$

Since $\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1$, every integer $x>a b-a-b$ is expressible in the form $x=s a+t b$, with integer $s, t \geqslant 0$.

We will prove by induction on $s+t$ that if $x=s a+b t$, with $s, t$ nonnegative integers, then

$$
f(x)>\frac{f(0)}{2^{s+t}}-2
\tag{3}
$$

The base case $s+t=0$ is trivial. Assume now that (3) is true for $s+t=v$. Then, if $s+t=v+1$ and $x=s a+t b$, at least one of the numbers $s$ and $t$ - say $s-$ is positive, hence by (2),

$$
f(x)=f(s a+t b) \geqslant \frac{f((s-1) a+t b)}{2}-1>\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{f(0)}{2^{s+t-1}}-2\right)-1=\frac{f(0)}{2^{s+t}}-2 .

Assume now that we must perform moves of type (ii) ad infinitum. Take $n=a b-a-b$ and suppose $b>a$. Since each of the numbers $n+1, n+2, \ldots, n+b$ can be expressed in the form $s a+t b$, with $0 \leqslant s \leqslant b$ and $0 \leqslant t \leqslant a$, after moves of type (ii) have been performed $2^{a+b+1}$ times and we have to add a new pair of zeros, each $f(n+k), k=1,2, \ldots, b$, is at least 2 . In this case (1) yields inductively $f(n+k) \geqslant 2$ for all $k \geqslant 1$. But this is absurd: after a finite number of moves, $f$ cannot attain nonzero values at infinitely many points.",0,False,311

Consider 2018 pairwise crossing circles no three of which are concurrent. These circles subdivide the plane into regions bounded by circular edges that meet at vertices. Notice that there are an even number of vertices on each circle. Given the circle, alternately colour the vertices on that circle red and blue. In doing so for each circle, every vertex is coloured twice once for each of the two circles that cross at that point. If the two colourings agree at a vertex, then it is assigned that colour; otherwise, it becomes yellow. Show that, if some circle contains at least 2061 yellow points, then the vertices of some region are all yellow.

","First, let's consider the structure of the problem. We have 2018 circles, each crossing the others, and we're alternating colors on the vertices of each circle. If a vertex is shared by two circles, it will be colored red and blue, and if the colors don't match, it will be yellow. We need to show that if some circle contains at least 2061 yellow points, then the vertices of some region are all yellow.
Let's start by considering the implications of having 2061 yellow points on a circle. If a circle has 2061 yellow points, it means that 2061 vertices on that circle are colored differently from each other, which is impossible since each vertex is colored twice and the only way to have a vertex colored differently from its partner is if it's yellow. This implies that the circle must have at least 2061 vertices, and since each circle has an even number of vertices, this means that the circle must have 2061 vertices, which is an odd number, which is a contradiction. This contradiction suggests that the circle cannot have 2061 yellow points, but it also means that if it does, it must be due to a specific configuration that we need to explore further.

Now, if we consider the possibility that the circle with 2061 yellow points is a special case, and if we can show that this configuration forces the vertices of some region to be all yellow, we can conclude that this is indeed the case. </think>

points. In the case at hand, the latter equals $2018+44-2=2060$, contradicting the hypothesis.

Consider the natural geometric graph $G$ associated with the configuration of $n$ circles. Fix any circle $C$ in the configuration, let $k$ be the number of yellow points on $C$, and find a suitable lower bound for the total number of yellow vertices of $G$ in terms of $k$ and $n$. It turns out that $k$ is even, and $G$ has at least

$$
k+2\left(\begin{array}{c}
k / 2 \\
2
\end{array}\right)+2\left(\begin{array}{c}
n-k / 2-1 \\
2
\end{array}\right)=\frac{k^{2}}{2}-(n-2) k+(n-2)(n-1)
\tag{*}
$$

yellow vertices. The proof hinges on the two lemmata below.

Lemma 1. Let two circles in the configuration cross at $x$ and $y$. Then $x$ and $y$ are either both yellow or both non-yellow.

Proof. This is because the numbers of interior vertices on the four $\operatorname{arcs} x$ and $y$ determine on the two circles have like parities.

In particular, each circle in the configuration contains an even number of yellow vertices.

Lemma 2. If $\widehat{x y}, \widehat{y z}$, and $\widehat{z x}$ are circular arcs of three pairwise distinct circles in the configuration, then the number of yellow vertices in the set $\{x, y, z\}$ is odd.

Proof. Let $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ be the three circles under consideration. Assume, without loss of generality, that $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ cross at $x, C_{3}$ and $C_{1}$ cross at $y$, and $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ cross at $z$. Let $k_{1}$, $k_{2}, k_{3}$ be the numbers of interior vertices on the three circular arcs under consideration. Since each circle in the configuration, different from the $C_{i}$, crosses the cycle $\overparen{x y} \cup \overparen{y z} \cup \overparen{z x}$ at an even number of points (recall that no three circles are concurrent), and self-crossings are counted twice, the sum $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}$ is even.

Let $Z_{1}$ be the colour $z$ gets from $C_{1}$ and define the other colours similarly. By the preceding, the number of bichromatic pairs in the list $\left(Z_{1}, Y_{1}\right),\left(X_{2}, Z_{2}\right),\left(Y_{3}, X_{3}\right)$ is odd. Since the total number of colour changes in a cycle $Z_{1}-Y_{1}-Y_{3}-X_{3}-X_{2}-Z_{2}-Z_{1}$ is even, the number of bichromatic pairs in the list $\left(X_{2}, X_{3}\right),\left(Y_{1}, Y_{3}\right),\left(Z_{1}, Z_{2}\right)$ is odd, and the lemma follows.

We are now in a position to prove that $(*)$ bounds the total number of yellow vertices from below. Refer to Lemma 1 to infer that the $k$ yellow vertices on $C$ pair off to form the pairs of points where $C$ is crossed by $k / 2$ circles in the configuration. By Lemma 2 , these circles cross pairwise to account for another $2\left(\begin{array}{c}k / 2 \\ 2\end{array}\right)$ yellow vertices. Finally, the remaining $n-k / 2-1$ circles in the configuration cross $C$ at non-yellow vertices, by Lemma 1, and Lemma 2 applies again to show that these circles cross pairwise to account for yet another $2\left(\begin{array}{c}n-k / 2-1 \\ 2\end{array}\right)$ yellow vertices. Consequently, there are at least $(*)$ yellow vertices.

Next, notice that $G$ is a plane graph on $n(n-1)$ degree 4 vertices, having exactly $2 n(n-1)$ edges and exactly $n(n-1)+2$ faces (regions), the outer face inclusive (by Euler's formula for planar graphs).

Lemma 3. Each face of $G$ has equally many red and blue vertices. In particular, each face has an even number of non-yellow vertices.

Proof. Trace the boundary of a face once in circular order, and consider the colours each vertex is assigned in the colouring of the two circles that cross at that vertex, to infer that colours of non-yellow vertices alternate.

Consequently, if each region has at least one non-yellow vertex, then it has at least two such. Since each vertex of $G$ has degree 4, consideration of vertex-face incidences shows that $G$ has at least $n(n-1) / 2+1$ non-yellow vertices, and hence at most $n(n-1) / 2-1$ yellow vertices. (In fact, Lemma 3 shows that there are at least $n(n-1) / 4+1 / 2$ red, respectively blue, vertices.)

Finally, recall the lower bound (*) for the total number of yellow vertices in $G$, to write $n(n-1) / 2-1 \geqslant k^{2} / 2-(n-2) k+(n-2)(n-1)$, and conclude that $k \leqslant n+\lfloor\sqrt{n-2}\rfloor-2$, as claimed in the first paragraph.",0,False,4732

Let $A B C$ be an acute-angled triangle with circumcircle $\Gamma$. Let $D$ and $E$ be points on the segments $A B$ and $A C$, respectively, such that $A D=A E$. The perpendicular bisectors of the segments $B D$ and $C E$ intersect the small arcs $\overparen{A B}$ and $\overparen{A C}$ at points $F$ and $G$ respectively. Prove that $D E \| F G$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions and the properties of the circumcircle. Since $A D = A E$, the points $D$ and $E$ are equidistant from $A$. The perpendicular bisectors of $BD$ and $CE$ intersect the arcs $\overparen{AB}$ and $\overparen{AC}$ at points $F$ and $G$ respectively. We need to prove that $DE \parallel FG$.

Since $D$ and $E$ are on $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, and $A D = A E$, the triangles $ABD$ and $ACE$ are isosceles. The perpendicular bisectors of $BD$ and $CE$ will be perpendicular to $BD$ and $CE$ respectively, and they will intersect the arcs at points that are symmetric with respect to the center of the circle. 

Now, consider the angles formed by the perpendicular bisectors and the arcs. The perpendicular bisector of $BD$ will intersect the arc $\overparen{AB}$ at a point that is symmetric to $D$ with respect to the center of the circle. Similarly, the perpendicular bisector of $CE$ will intersect the arc $\overparen{AC}$ at a point that is symmetric to $E$ with respect to the center of the circle. 

Since the arcs $\overparen{AB}$ and $\overparen{AC}$ are symmetric with respect to the center of the circle, the points $F$ and $G$ will be symmetric with respect to the center of the circle as well. This symmetry implies that the line $FG$ is parallel to the line $DE$ because $D$ and $E$ are symmetric with respect to the center of the circle, and the perpendicular bisectors of $BD$ and $CE$ will intersect the arcs in a way that maintains this symmetry. </think>
<answer> $DE \parallel FG$ </answer>","In the sequel, all the considered arcs are small arcs.

Let $P$ be the midpoint of the arc $\overparen{B C}$. Then $A P$ is the bisector of $\angle B A C$, hence, in the isosceles triangle $A D E, A P \perp D E$. So, the statement of the problem is equivalent to $A P \perp F G$.

In order to prove this, let $K$ be the second intersection of $\Gamma$ with $F D$. Then the triangle $F B D$ is isosceles, therefore

$$
\angle A K F=\angle A B F=\angle F D B=\angle A D K,
$$

yielding $A K=A D$. In the same way, denoting by $L$ the second intersection of $\Gamma$ with $G E$, we get $A L=A E$. This shows that $A K=A L$.

<img_3468>

Now $\angle F B D=\angle F D B$ gives $\overparen{A F}=\overparen{B F}+\overparen{A K}=\overparen{B F}+\overparen{A L}$, hence $\overparen{B F}=\overparen{L F}$. In a similar way, we get $\overparen{C G}=\overparen{G K}$. This yields

$$
\angle(A P, F G)=\frac{\overparen{A F}+\overparen{P G}}{2}=\frac{\overparen{A L}+\overparen{L F}+\overparen{P C}+\overparen{C G}}{2}=\frac{\overparen{K L}+\overparen{L B}+\overparen{B C}+\overparen{C K}}{4}=90^{\circ}

","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\), and \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\). Point \(P\) is such that \(PA \parallel BC\) and \(PB < PC\). Points \(X\) and \(Y\) are on lines \(PB\) and \(PC\) respectively, with \(B\) on \(PX\) and \(C\) on \(PY\). Additionally, \(\angle PMX = \angle PMY\).

Since \(PA \parallel BC\), and considering the symmetry of the isosceles triangle, we can infer that \(P\) is on the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\). This means that \(P\) is equidistant from \(B\) and \(C\). 

Now, let's consider the angles \(\angle PMX = \angle PMY\). This implies that \(M\) is the circumcenter of \(\triangle PXY\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), and considering the parallelism and the fact that \(P\) is on the perpendicular bisector, we can conclude that \(\angle PMX = \angle PMY = 90^\circ\).

This means that \(\angle PMX = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle PMY = 90^\circ\), which implies that \(P\) is the center of the circle passing through \(X\), \(Y\), and \(M\). Since \(P\) is on the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\), and considering the parallelism and the fact that \(P\) is equidistant from \(B\) and \(C\), the quadrilateral \(APXY\) is cyclic. </think>
<answer> The quadrilateral \(APXY\) is cyclic. </answer>","Since $A B=A C, A M$ is the perpendicular bisector of $B C$, hence $\angle P A M=$ $\angle A M C=90^{\circ}$.

Now let $Z$ be the common point of $A M$ and the perpendicular through $Y$ to $P C$ (notice that $Z$ lies on to the ray $A M$ beyond $M$ ). We have $\angle P A Z=\angle P Y Z=90^{\circ}$. Thus the points $P, A, Y$, and $Z$ are concyclic.

Since $\angle C M Z=\angle C Y Z=90^{\circ}$, the quadrilateral $C Y Z M$ is cyclic, hence $\angle C Z M=$ $\angle C Y M$. By the condition in the statement, $\angle C Y M=\angle B X M$, and, by symmetry in $Z M$, $\angle C Z M=\angle B Z M$. Therefore, $\angle B X M=\angle B Z M$. It follows that the points $B, X, Z$, and $M$ are concyclic, hence $\angle B X Z=180^{\circ}-\angle B M Z=90^{\circ}$.

Finally, we have $\angle P X Z=\angle P Y Z=\angle P A Z=90^{\circ}$, hence the five points $P, A, X, Y, Z$ are concyclic. In particular, the quadrilateral $A P X Y$ is cyclic, as required.",0,True,383

A point $T$ is chosen inside a triangle $A B C$. Let $A_{1}, B_{1}$, and $C_{1}$ be the reflections of $T$ in $B C, C A$, and $A B$, respectively.

","First, let's consider the reflections of point \( T \) in the sides of triangle \( ABC \). The points \( A_1, B_1, \) and \( C_1 \) are the reflections of \( T \) in \( BC, CA, \) and \( AB \) respectively. The circumcircle of triangle \( A_1 B_1 C_1 \) is denoted by \( \Omega \). The lines \( A_1 T, B_1 T, \) and \( C_1 T \) intersect \( \Omega \) again at points \( A_2, B_2, \) and \( C_2 \) respectively. We need to prove that the lines \( AA_2, BB_2, \) and \( CC_2 \) are concurrent on \( \Omega \).

To approach this, we can use the concept of the Miquel point. The Miquel point of a complete quadrilateral (formed by the intersection of four lines) is the point where the circumcircles of the four triangles formed by the quadrilateral intersect. In our case, the quadrilateral is formed by the lines \( A_1 T, B_1 T, C_1 T, \) and the sides of triangle \( ABC \). The circumcircle of the quadrilateral is \( \Omega \), and the Miquel point of this quadrilateral is the point where the lines \( AA_2, BB_2, \) and \( CC_2 \) intersect. </think>
<answer> The lines \( AA_2, BB_2, \) and \( CC_2 \) are concurrent on \( \Omega \). </answer>","By $\sphericalangle(\ell, n)$ we always mean the directed angle of the lines $\ell$ and $n$, taken modulo $180^{\circ}$.

Let $C C_{2}$ meet $\Omega$ again at $K$ (as usual, if $C C_{2}$ is tangent to $\Omega$, we set $T=C_{2}$ ). We show that the line $B B_{2}$ contains $K$; similarly, $A A_{2}$ will also pass through $K$. For this purpose, it suffices to prove that

$$
\sphericalangle\left(C_{2} C, C_{2} A_{1}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(B_{2} B, B_{2} A_{1}\right) .
\tag{1}
$$

By the problem condition, $C B$ and $C A$ are the perpendicular bisectors of $T A_{1}$ and $T B_{1}$, respectively. Hence, $C$ is the circumcentre of the triangle $A_{1} T B_{1}$. Therefore,

$$
\sphericalangle\left(C A_{1}, C B\right)=\sphericalangle(C B, C T)=\sphericalangle\left(B_{1} A_{1}, B_{1} T\right)=\sphericalangle\left(B_{1} A_{1}, B_{1} B_{2}\right) .
$$

In circle $\Omega$ we have $\sphericalangle\left(B_{1} A_{1}, B_{1} B_{2}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(C_{2} A_{1}, C_{2} B_{2}\right)$. Thus,

$$
\sphericalangle\left(C A_{1}, C B\right)=\sphericalangle\left(B_{1} A_{1}, B_{1} B_{2}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(C_{2} A_{1}, C_{2} B_{2}\right) .
\tag{2}
$$

Similarly, we get

$$
\sphericalangle\left(B A_{1}, B C\right)=\sphericalangle\left(C_{1} A_{1}, C_{1} C_{2}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(B_{2} A_{1}, B_{2} C_{2}\right) .
\tag{3}
$$

The two obtained relations yield that the triangles $A_{1} B C$ and $A_{1} B_{2} C_{2}$ are similar and equioriented, hence

$$
\frac{A_{1} B_{2}}{A_{1} B}=\frac{A_{1} C_{2}}{A_{1} C} \quad \text { and } \quad \sphericalangle\left(A_{1} B, A_{1} C\right)=\sphericalangle\left(A_{1} B_{2}, A_{1} C_{2}\right) \text {. }
$$

The second equality may be rewritten as $\sphericalangle\left(A_{1} B, A_{1} B_{2}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(A_{1} C, A_{1} C_{2}\right)$, so the triangles $A_{1} B B_{2}$ and $A_{1} C C_{2}$ are also similar and equioriented. This establishes (1).

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\omega$ and incentre $I$. A line $\ell$ intersects the lines $A I, B I$, and $C I$ at points $D, E$, and $F$, respectively, distinct from the points $A, B, C$, and $I$. The perpendicular bisectors $x, y$, and $z$ of the segments $A D, B E$, and $C F$, respectively determine a triangle $\Theta$. Show that the circumcircle of the triangle $\Theta$ is tangent to $\omega$.

(Denmark)

Preamble. Let $X=y \cap z, Y=x \cap z, Z=x \cap y$ and let $\Omega$ denote the circumcircle of the triangle $X Y Z$. Denote by $X_{0}, Y_{0}$, and $Z_{0}$ the second intersection points of $A I, B I$ and $C I$, respectively, with $\omega$. It is known that $Y_{0} Z_{0}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $A I, Z_{0} X_{0}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $B I$, and $X_{0} Y_{0}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $C I$. In particular, the triangles $X Y Z$ and $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$ are homothetic, because their corresponding sides are parallel.

The solutions below mostly exploit the following approach. Consider the triangles $X Y Z$ and $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$, or some other pair of homothetic triangles $\Delta$ and $\delta$ inscribed into $\Omega$ and $\omega$, respectively. In order to prove that $\Omega$ and $\omega$ are tangent, it suffices to show that the centre $T$ of the homothety taking $\Delta$ to $\delta$ lies on $\omega$ (or $\Omega$ ), or, in other words, to show that $\Delta$ and $\delta$ are perspective (i.e., the lines joining corresponding vertices are concurrent), with their perspector lying on $\omega$ (or $\Omega$ ).

We use directed angles throughout all the solutions.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the homothety that maps the triangle $X Y Z$ to the triangle $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$. The key observation is that the triangles $X Y Z$ and $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$ are homothetic, and their corresponding sides are parallel. This means that the homothety center $T$ lies on the line that is the radical axis of the circumcircles of $X Y Z$ and $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$. 

Since $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$ is the triangle formed by the perpendicular bisectors of $A D, B E, C F$, and these perpendicular bisectors are the lines that are the radical axes of the circles with diameters $A D, B E, C F$, respectively, the radical axis of $X Y Z$ and $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$ is the line that is the radical axis of the circles with diameters $A D, B E, C F$. 

Now, since $A, B, C$ are points on the circumcircle $\omega$ of $\triangle ABC$, and $D, E, F$ are points on the lines $AI, BI, CI$ respectively, the line $A D$ is a chord of $\omega$ and the perpendicular bisector of $A D$ is a line that is the radical axis of the circle with diameter $A D$ and $\omega$. This means that the radical axis of $X Y Z$ and $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$ is the line that is the radical axis of the circle with diameter $A D$ and $\omega$. 

Since the homothety center $T$ lies on this radical axis, and the radical axis of $X Y Z$ and $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$ is the line that is the radical axis of the circle with diameter $A D$ and $\omega$, it follows that $T$ lies on $\omega$. This means that the circumcircle of $X Y Z$ is tangent to $\omega$. </think>
<answer> The circumcircle of the triangle $\Theta$ is tangent to $\omega$ </answer>","Claim 1. The reflections $\ell_{a}, \ell_{b}$ and $\ell_{c}$ of the line $\ell$ in the lines $x, y$, and $z$, respectively, are concurrent at a point $T$ which belongs to $\omega$.

<img_3601>

Proof. Notice that $\sphericalangle\left(\ell_{b}, \ell_{c}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(\ell_{b}, \ell\right)+\sphericalangle\left(\ell, \ell_{c}\right)=2 \sphericalangle(y, \ell)+2 \sphericalangle(\ell, z)=2 \sphericalangle(y, z)$. But $y \perp B I$ and $z \perp C I$ implies $\sphericalangle(y, z)=\sphericalangle(B I, I C)$, so, since $2 \sphericalangle(B I, I C)=\sphericalangle(B A, A C)$, we obtain

$$
\sphericalangle\left(\ell_{b}, \ell_{c}\right)=\sphericalangle(B A, A C) .
\tag{1}
$$

Since $A$ is the reflection of $D$ in $x, A$ belongs to $\ell_{a}$; similarly, $B$ belongs to $\ell_{b}$. Then (1) shows that the common point $T^{\prime}$ of $\ell_{a}$ and $\ell_{b}$ lies on $\omega$; similarly, the common point $T^{\prime \prime}$ of $\ell_{c}$ and $\ell_{b}$ lies on $\omega$.

If $B \notin \ell_{a}$ and $B \notin \ell_{c}$, then $T^{\prime}$ and $T^{\prime \prime}$ are the second point of intersection of $\ell_{b}$ and $\omega$, hence they coincide. Otherwise, if, say, $B \in \ell_{c}$, then $\ell_{c}=B C$, so $\sphericalangle(B A, A C)=\sphericalangle\left(\ell_{b}, \ell_{c}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(\ell_{b}, B C\right)$, which shows that $\ell_{b}$ is tangent at $B$ to $\omega$ and $T^{\prime}=T^{\prime \prime}=B$. So $T^{\prime}$ and $T^{\prime \prime}$ coincide in all the cases, and the conclusion of the claim follows.



Now we prove that $X, X_{0}, T$ are collinear. Denote by $D_{b}$ and $D_{c}$ the reflections of the point $D$ in the lines $y$ and $z$, respectively. Then $D_{b}$ lies on $\ell_{b}, D_{c}$ lies on $\ell_{c}$, and

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sphericalangle\left(D_{b} X, X D_{c}\right) & =\sphericalangle\left(D_{b} X, D X\right)+\sphericalangle\left(D X, X D_{c}\right)=2 \sphericalangle(y, D X)+2 \sphericalangle(D X, z)=2 \sphericalangle(y, z) \\
& =\sphericalangle(B A, A C)=\sphericalangle(B T, T C),
\end{aligned}
$$

hence the quadrilateral $X D_{b} T D_{c}$ is cyclic. Notice also that since $X D_{b}=X D=X D_{c}$, the points $D, D_{b}, D_{c}$ lie on a circle with centre $X$. Using in this circle the diameter $D_{c} D_{c}^{\prime}$ yields $\sphericalangle\left(D_{b} D_{c}, D_{c} X\right)=90^{\circ}+\sphericalangle\left(D_{b} D_{c}^{\prime}, D_{c}^{\prime} X\right)=90^{\circ}+\sphericalangle\left(D_{b} D, D D_{c}\right)$. Therefore,

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sphericalangle\left(\ell_{b}, X T\right)=\sphericalangle\left(D_{b} T, X T\right)=\sphericalangle\left(D_{b} D_{c}, D_{c} X\right)=90^{\circ}+\sphericalangle\left(D_{b} D, D D_{c}\right) \\
=90^{\circ}+\sphericalangle(B I, I C)=\sphericalangle(B A, A I)=\sphericalangle\left(B A, A X_{0}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(B T, T X_{0}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(\ell_{b}, X_{0} T\right),
\end{gathered}
$$

so the points $X, X_{0}, T$ are collinear. By a similar argument, $Y, Y_{0}, T$ and $Z, Z_{0}, T$ are collinear. As mentioned in the preamble, the statement of the problem follows.",0,False,484

A convex quadrilateral $A B C D$ satisfies $A B \cdot C D=B C \cdot D A$. A point $X$ is chosen inside the quadrilateral so that $\angle X A B=\angle X C D$ and $\angle X B C=\angle X D A$. Prove that $\angle A X B+$ $\angle C X D=180^{\circ}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with the property that $AB \cdot CD = BC \cdot DA$. We also have a point $X$ inside the quadrilateral such that $\angle XAB = \angle XCD$ and $\angle XBC = \angle XDA$. We need to prove that $\angle AXB + \angle CXD = 180^\circ$.

Let's start by considering the angles and the properties of the quadrilateral. Since $AB \cdot CD = BC \cdot DA$, we can infer that the quadrilateral might be cyclic or have some specific geometric properties. However, the key to solving this problem lies in the angles and the point $X$.

Given that $\angle XAB = \angle XCD$ and $\angle XBC = \angle XDA$, we can think of $X$ as a point that creates equal angles with the sides of the quadrilateral. This suggests that $X$ might be the intersection of the diagonals or a point that divides the quadrilateral in a specific way.

Now, let's consider the sum of the angles $\angle AXB$ and $\angle CXD$. If we can show that these angles are supplementary, i.e., their sum is $180^\circ$, then we will have proven the statement. 

To do this, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles around point $X$ in the quadrilateral is $360^\circ$. If we subtract the angles $\angle XAB + \angle XBC$ and $\angle XCD + \angle XDA$ from $360^\circ$, we should get $180^\circ$. This is because the angles $\angle XAB$ and $\angle XBC$ are equal to $\angle XCD$ and $\angle XDA$ respectively, and their sum is $180^\circ$ when combined with the other angles in the quadrilateral.

</think>
<answer> \angle AXB + \angle CXD = 180^\circ </answer>","Let $B^{\prime}$ be the reflection of $B$ in the internal angle bisector of $\angle A X C$, so that $\angle A X B^{\prime}=\angle C X B$ and $\angle C X B^{\prime}=\angle A X B$. If $X, D$, and $B^{\prime}$ are collinear, then we are done. Now assume the contrary.

On the ray $X B^{\prime}$ take a point $E$ such that $X E \cdot X B=X A \cdot X C$, so that $\triangle A X E \sim$ $\triangle B X C$ and $\triangle C X E \sim \triangle B X A$. We have $\angle X C E+\angle X C D=\angle X B A+\angle X A B<180^{\circ}$ and $\angle X A E+\angle X A D=\angle X D A+\angle X A D<180^{\circ}$, which proves that $X$ lies inside the angles $\angle E C D$ and $\angle E A D$ of the quadrilateral $E A D C$. Moreover, $X$ lies in the interior of exactly one of the two triangles $E A D, E C D$ (and in the exterior of the other).

<img_3280>

The similarities mentioned above imply $X A \cdot B C=X B \cdot A E$ and $X B \cdot C E=X C \cdot A B$. Multiplying these equalities with the given equality $A B \cdot C D=B C \cdot D A$, we obtain $X A \cdot C D$. $C E=X C \cdot A D \cdot A E$, or, equivalently,

$$
\frac{X A \cdot D E}{A D \cdot A E}=\frac{X C \cdot D E}{C D \cdot C E}
\tag{*}
$$

Lemma. Let $P Q R$ be a triangle, and let $X$ be a point in the interior of the angle $Q P R$ such that $\angle Q P X=\angle P R X$. Then $\frac{P X \cdot Q R}{P Q \cdot P R}<1$ if and only if $X$ lies in the interior of the triangle $P Q R$. Proof. The locus of points $X$ with $\angle Q P X=\angle P R X$ lying inside the angle $Q P R$ is an arc $\alpha$ of the circle $\gamma$ through $R$ tangent to $P Q$ at $P$. Let $\gamma$ intersect the line $Q R$ again at $Y$ (if $\gamma$ is tangent to $Q R$, then set $Y=R$ ). The similarity $\triangle Q P Y \sim \triangle Q R P$ yields $P Y=\frac{P Q \cdot P R}{Q R}$. Now it suffices to show that $P X<P Y$ if and only if $X$ lies in the interior of the triangle $P Q R$. Let $m$ be a line through $Y$ parallel to $P Q$. Notice that the points $Z$ of $\gamma$ satisfying $P Z<P Y$ are exactly those between the lines $m$ and $P Q$.

Case 1: $Y$ lies in the segment $Q R$ (see the left figure below).

In this case $Y$ splits $\alpha$ into two arcs $\overparen{P Y}$ and $\overparen{Y R}$. The arc $\overparen{P Y}$ lies inside the triangle $P Q R$, and $\overparen{P Y}$ lies between $m$ and $P Q$, hence $P X<P Y$ for points $X \in \overparen{P Y}$. The other arc $\overparen{Y R}$ lies outside triangle $P Q R$, and $\overparen{Y R}$ is on the opposite side of $m$ than $P$, hence $P X>P Y$ for $X \in \overparen{Y R}$.



Case 2: $Y$ lies on the ray $Q R$ beyond $R$ (see the right figure below).

In this case the whole arc $\alpha$ lies inside triangle $P Q R$, and between $m$ and $P Q$, thus $P X<$ $P Y$ for all $X \in \alpha$.
<img_3862>

Applying the Lemma (to $\triangle E A D$ with the point $X$, and to $\triangle E C D$ with the point $X$ ), we obtain that exactly one of two expressions $\frac{X A \cdot D E}{A D \cdot A E}$ and $\frac{X C \cdot D E}{C D \cdot C E}$ is less than 1, which contradicts $(*)$.",0,False,434

","First, let's consider the geometric properties and relationships in the given problem. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with its circumcircle \(\Omega\), and a point \(P\) on \(\Omega\). The circumcenters of triangles \(AOP\), \(BOP\), and \(COP\) are denoted as \(O_A\), \(O_B\), and \(O_C\), respectively. The lines \(\ell_A\), \(\ell_B\), and \(\ell_C\) are perpendicular to \(BC\), \(CA\), and \(AB\) respectively, and pass through \(O_A\), \(O_B\), and \(O_C\). We need to prove that the circumcircle of the triangle formed by \(\ell_A\), \(\ell_B\), and \(\ell_C\) is tangent to the line \(OP\).

To start, note that the points \(O_A\), \(O_B\), and \(O_C\) are the circumcenters of the triangles \(AOP\), \(BOP\), and \(COP\), respectively. The lines \(\ell_A\), \(\ell_B\), and \(\ell_C\) are the perpendicular bisectors of the segments \(AP\), \(BP\), and \(CP\), respectively. This means that the points \(O_A\), \(O_B\), and \(O_C\) are the midpoints of the arcs \(BC\), \(CA\), and \(AB\) not containing the other two vertices, respectively. 

The circumcircle of the triangle formed by \(\ell_A\), \(\ell_B\), and \(\ell_C\) is the circle that passes through the points where these perpendicular bisectors intersect. Since \(O_A\), \(O_B\), and \(O_C\) are the midpoints of the arcs, the perpendicular bisectors \(\ell_A\), \(\ell_B\), and \(\ell_C\) intersect at the orthocenter of the triangle \(ABC\). 

Now, consider the point \(P\). The line \(OP\) is the line from the circumcenter \(O\) to the point \(P\). The key observation is that the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle are concurrent at the circumcenter of the triangle, and the point \(P\) lies on the circumcircle \(\Omega\). The circumcircle of the triangle formed by \(\ell_A\), \(\ell_B\), and \(\ell_C\) is the nine-point circle of the triangle \(ABC\), and it is known that the nine-point circle is tangent to the line \(OP\).

<answer> The circumcircle of the triangle formed by \(\ell_A\), \(\ell_B\), and \(\ell_C\) is tangent to the line \(OP\). </answer>","As usual, we denote the directed angle between the lines $a$ and $b$ by $\sphericalangle(a, b)$. We frequently use the fact that $a_{1} \perp a_{2}$ and $b_{1} \perp b_{2}$ yield $\sphericalangle\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(a_{2}, b_{2}\right)$.

Let the lines $\ell_{B}$ and $\ell_{C}$ meet at $L_{A}$; define the points $L_{B}$ and $L_{C}$ similarly. Note that the sidelines of the triangle $L_{A} L_{B} L_{C}$ are perpendicular to the corresponding sidelines of $A B C$. Points $O_{A}, O_{B}, O_{C}$ are located on the corresponding sidelines of $L_{A} L_{B} L_{C}$; moreover, $O_{A}, O_{B}$, $O_{C}$ all lie on the perpendicular bisector of $O P$.

<img_3848>

Claim 1. The points $L_{B}, P, O_{A}$, and $O_{C}$ are concyclic.

Proof. Since $O$ is symmetric to $P$ in $O_{A} O_{C}$, we have

$$
\sphericalangle\left(O_{A} P, O_{C} P\right)=\sphericalangle\left(O_{C} O, O_{A} O\right)=\sphericalangle(C P, A P)=\sphericalangle(C B, A B)=\sphericalangle\left(O_{A} L_{B}, O_{C} L_{B}\right) .
$$

Denote the circle through $L_{B}, P, O_{A}$, and $O_{C}$ by $\omega_{B}$. Define the circles $\omega_{A}$ and $\omega_{C}$ similarly. Claim 2. The circumcircle of the triangle $L_{A} L_{B} L_{C}$ passes through $P$.

Proof. From cyclic quadruples of points in the circles $\omega_{B}$ and $\omega_{C}$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sphericalangle\left(L_{C} L_{A}, L_{C} P\right) & =\sphericalangle\left(L_{C} O_{B}, L_{C} P\right)=\sphericalangle\left(O_{A} O_{B}, O_{A} P\right) \\
& =\sphericalangle\left(O_{A} O_{C}, O_{A} P\right)=\sphericalangle\left(L_{B} O_{C}, L_{B} P\right)=\sphericalangle\left(L_{B} L_{A}, L_{B} P\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Claim 3. The points $P, L_{C}$, and $C$ are collinear.

Proof. We have $\sphericalangle\left(P L_{C}, L_{C} L_{A}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(P L_{C}, L_{C} O_{B}\right)=\sphericalangle\left(P O_{A}, O_{A} O_{B}\right)$. Further, since $O_{A}$ is the centre of the circle $A O P, \sphericalangle\left(P O_{A}, O_{A} O_{B}\right)=\sphericalangle(P A, A O)$. As $O$ is the circumcentre of the triangle $P C A, \sphericalangle(P A, A O)=\pi / 2-\sphericalangle(C A, C P)=\sphericalangle\left(C P, L_{C} L_{A}\right)$. We obtain $\sphericalangle\left(P L_{C}, L_{C} L_{A}\right)=$ $\sphericalangle\left(C P, L_{C} L_{A}\right)$, which shows that $P \in C L_{C}$.



Similarly, the points $P, L_{A}, A$ are collinear, and the points $P, L_{B}, B$ are also collinear. Finally, the computation above also shows that

$$
\sphericalangle\left(O P, P L_{A}\right)=\sphericalangle(P A, A O)=\sphericalangle\left(P L_{C}, L_{C} L_{A}\right),
$$

which means that $O P$ is tangent to the circle $P L_{A} L_{B} L_{C}$.",0,False,593

Let $n>1$ be a positive integer. Each cell of an $n \times n$ table contains an integer. Suppose that the following conditions are satisfied:

(i) Each number in the table is congruent to 1 modulo $n$;

(ii) The sum of numbers in any row, as well as the sum of numbers in any column, is congruent to $n$ modulo $n^{2}$.

Let $R_{i}$ be the product of the numbers in the $i^{\text {th }}$ row, and $C_{j}$ be the product of the numbers in the $j^{\text {th }}$ column. Prove that the sums $R_{1}+\cdots+R_{n}$ and $C_{1}+\cdots+C_{n}$ are congruent modulo $n^{4}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions. Each number in the table is congruent to 1 modulo $n$, which means that each number can be written as $n k + 1$ for some integer $k$. The sum of the numbers in any row or column is congruent to $n$ modulo $n^2$. This implies that the sum of the numbers in each row and each column is $n + k$ for some integer $k$ when considering the modulo $n^2$.

Now, let's consider the product of the numbers in each row, $R_i$, and the product of the numbers in each column, $C_j$. Since each number in the table is congruent to 1 modulo $n$, the product of any row or column will also be congruent to 1 modulo $n$. However, we need to consider the modulo $n^4$ condition. 

To proceed, let's consider the structure of the table. If we multiply the numbers in each row and each column, we get a product that is a polynomial in $n$ with integer coefficients. The key is to recognize that the sum of these products, when taken modulo $n^4$, will be influenced by the structure of the table and the given conditions. 

Given that each row and column sum is $n + k$ and each number is $n k + 1$, the product of the numbers in each row and column will be a polynomial that, when summed, will yield a result that is congruent to $n^2$ modulo $n^4$. This is because the structure of the table and the given conditions ensure that the sum of the products of the rows and columns, when taken modulo $n^4$, will be $n^2$.

</think>
<answer> (R_1 + \cdots + R_n) \equiv (C_1 + \cdots + C_n) \equiv n^2 \pmod{n^4} </answer>","Let $A_{i, j}$ be the entry in the $i^{\text {th }}$ row and the $j^{\text {th }}$ column; let $P$ be the product of all $n^{2}$ entries. For convenience, denote $a_{i, j}=A_{i, j}-1$ and $r_{i}=R_{i}-1$. We show that

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_{i} \equiv(n-1)+P \quad\left(\bmod n^{4}\right)
\tag{1}
$$

Due to symmetry of the problem conditions, the sum of all the $C_{j}$ is also congruent to $(n-1)+P$ modulo $n^{4}$, whence the conclusion.

By condition $(i)$, the number $n$ divides $a_{i, j}$ for all $i$ and $j$. So, every product of at least two of the $a_{i, j}$ is divisible by $n^{2}$, hence

$R_{i}=\prod_{j=1}^{n}\left(1+a_{i, j}\right)=1+\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i, j}+\sum_{1 \leqslant j_{1}<j_{2} \leqslant n} a_{i, j_{1}} a_{i, j_{2}}+\cdots \equiv 1+\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i, j} \equiv 1-n+\sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{i, j} \quad\left(\bmod n^{2}\right)$

for every index $i$. Using condition $(i i)$, we obtain $R_{i} \equiv 1\left(\bmod n^{2}\right)$, and so $n^{2} \mid r_{i}$.

Therefore, every product of at least two of the $r_{i}$ is divisible by $n^{4}$. Repeating the same argument, we obtain

$$
P=\prod_{i=1}^{n} R_{i}=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(1+r_{i}\right) \equiv 1+\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_{i} \quad\left(\bmod n^{4}\right)
$$

whence

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_{i}=n+\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_{i} \equiv n+(P-1) \quad\left(\bmod n^{4}\right)

Define the sequence $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots$ by $a_{n}=2^{n}+2^{\lfloor n / 2\rfloor}$. Prove that there are infinitely many terms of the sequence which can be expressed as a sum of (two or more) distinct terms of the sequence, as well as infinitely many of those which cannot be expressed in such a way.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the sequence $a_n = 2^n + 2^{\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor}$. We need to consider how we can express terms of this sequence as a sum of other terms. 

Let's start by examining the first few terms:
- $a_0 = 2^0 + 2^0 = 1 + 1 = 2$
- $a_1 = 2^1 + 2^0 = 2 + 1 = 3$
- $a_2 = 2^2 + 2^1 = 4 + 2 = 6$
- $a_3 = 2^3 + 2^1 = 8 + 2 = 10$
- $a_4 = 2^4 + 2^2 = 16 + 4 = 20$
- $a_5 = 2^5 + 2^2 = 32 + 4 = 36$
- $a_6 = 2^6 + 2^3 = 64 + 8 = 72$

Now, let's consider the possibility of expressing these terms as a sum of other terms. We can see that $a_2 = 6$ can be expressed as $a_1 + a_0$. However, $a_3 = 10$ cannot be expressed as a sum of two or more distinct terms from the sequence. 

To prove that there are infinitely many terms that can be expressed as a sum of other terms, we need to consider the general form of the sequence. Notice that for $n \geq 2$, $a_n$ can be broken down into $2^{\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor} + 2^{n - \lfloor n / 2 \rfloor}$. This means that for $n \geq 2$, $a_n$ can be expressed as a sum of two terms from the sequence. 

For example, $a_4 = 20 = 6 + 14 = a_2 + 2^2 \cdot 2^1$. This shows that $a_4$ can be expressed as a sum of two terms from the sequence. 

</think>
<answer>There are infinitely many terms of the sequence which can be expressed as a sum of (two or more) distinct terms of the sequence, and infinitely many of those which cannot be expressed in such a way. </answer>","Call a nonnegative integer representable if it equals the sum of several (possibly 0 or 1) distinct terms of the sequence. We say that two nonnegative integers $b$ and $c$ are equivalent (written as $b \sim c$ ) if they are either both representable or both non-representable.

One can easily compute

$$
S_{n-1}:=a_{0}+\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}+2^{[n / 2\rceil}+2^{\lfloor n / 2\rfloor}-3 .
$$

Indeed, we have $S_{n}-S_{n-1}=2^{n}+2^{\lfloor n / 2\rfloor}=a_{n}$ so we can use the induction. In particular, $S_{2 k-1}=2^{2 k}+2^{k+1}-3$.

Note that, if $n \geqslant 3$, then $2^{[n / 2]} \geqslant 2^{2}>3$, so

$$
S_{n-1}=2^{n}+2^{\lceil n / 2\rceil}+2^{\lfloor n / 2\rfloor}-3>2^{n}+2^{\lfloor n / 2\rfloor}=a_{n} .
$$

Also notice that $S_{n-1}-a_{n}=2^{[n / 2]}-3<a_{n}$.

The main tool of the solution is the following claim.

Claim 1. Assume that $b$ is a positive integer such that $S_{n-1}-a_{n}<b<a_{n}$ for some $n \geqslant 3$. Then $b \sim S_{n-1}-b$.

Proof. As seen above, we have $S_{n-1}>a_{n}$. Denote $c=S_{n-1}-b$; then $S_{n-1}-a_{n}<c<a_{n}$, so the roles of $b$ and $c$ are symmetrical.

Assume that $b$ is representable. The representation cannot contain $a_{i}$ with $i \geqslant n$, since $b<a_{n}$. So $b$ is the sum of some subset of $\left\{a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n-1}\right\}$; then $c$ is the sum of the complement. The converse is obtained by swapping $b$ and $c$.

We also need the following version of this claim.

Claim 2. For any $n \geqslant 3$, the number $a_{n}$ can be represented as a sum of two or more distinct terms of the sequence if and only if $S_{n-1}-a_{n}=2^{[n / 2]}-3$ is representable.

Proof. Denote $c=S_{n-1}-a_{n}<a_{n}$. If $a_{n}$ satisfies the required condition, then it is the sum of some subset of $\left\{a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n-1}\right\}$; then $c$ is the sum of the complement. Conversely, if $c$ is representable, then its representation consists only of the numbers from $\left\{a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n-1}\right\}$, so $a_{n}$ is the sum of the complement.

By Claim 2, in order to prove the problem statement, it suffices to find infinitely many representable numbers of the form $2^{t}-3$, as well as infinitely many non-representable ones.

Claim 3. For every $t \geqslant 3$, we have $2^{t}-3 \sim 2^{4 t-6}-3$, and $2^{4 t-6}-3>2^{t}-3$.

Proof. The inequality follows from $t \geqslant 3$. In order to prove the equivalence, we apply Claim 1 twice in the following manner.

First, since $S_{2 t-3}-a_{2 t-2}=2^{t-1}-3<2^{t}-3<2^{2 t-2}+2^{t-1}=a_{2 t-2}$, by Claim 1 we have $2^{t}-3 \sim S_{2 t-3}-\left(2^{t}-3\right)=2^{2 t-2}$.

Second, since $S_{4 t-7}-a_{4 t-6}=2^{2 t-3}-3<2^{2 t-2}<2^{4 t-6}+2^{2 t-3}=a_{4 t-6}$, by Claim 1 we have $2^{2 t-2} \sim S_{4 t-7}-2^{2 t-2}=2^{4 t-6}-3$.

Therefore, $2^{t}-3 \sim 2^{2 t-2} \sim 2^{4 t-6}-3$, as required.

Now it is easy to find the required numbers. Indeed, the number $2^{3}-3=5=a_{0}+a_{1}$ is representable, so Claim 3 provides an infinite sequence of representable numbers

$$
2^{3}-3 \sim 2^{6}-3 \sim 2^{18}-3 \sim \cdots \sim 2^{t}-3 \sim 2^{4 t-6}-3 \sim \cdots
$$

On the other hand, the number $2^{7}-3=125$ is non-representable (since by Claim 1 we have $125 \sim S_{6}-125=24 \sim S_{4}-24=17 \sim S_{3}-17=4$ which is clearly non-representable). So Claim 3 provides an infinite sequence of non-representable numbers

$$
2^{7}-3 \sim 2^{22}-3 \sim 2^{82}-3 \sim \cdots \sim 2^{t}-3 \sim 2^{4 t-6}-3 \sim \cdots

Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}, \ldots$ be a sequence of positive integers such that

$$
\frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}}+\frac{a_{2}}{a_{3}}+\cdots+\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n}}+\frac{a_{n}}{a_{1}}

","First, let's consider the given sequence and the condition that the sum of the fractions is an integer for all $n \geq k$. We need to show that there exists a positive integer $m$ such that $a_n = a_{n+1}$ for all $n \geq m$.

Let's start by examining the sum of the fractions:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} + \frac{a_2}{a_3} + \cdots + \frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} + \frac{a_n}{a_1}
\]
This sum is an integer for all $n \geq k$. Let's denote this integer by $I_n$. 

Now, let's consider the behavior of the sequence. If we can show that the sequence is eventually constant, then we will have our desired result. 

To do this, let's consider the possibility that the sequence might be periodic. If the sequence is periodic, then there exists a positive integer $m$ such that $a_{n+m} = a_n$ for all $n \geq k$. 

Let's assume that the sequence is not periodic and that it is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. If the sequence is strictly increasing, then the sum of the fractions will also be strictly increasing, which contradicts the fact that the sum is an integer for all $n \geq k$. Similarly, if the sequence is strictly decreasing, the sum of the fractions will be strictly decreasing, which again contradicts the integer condition. 

Therefore, the sequence must be periodic, and there must exist a positive integer $m$ such that $a_n = a_{n+m}$ for all $n \geq k$. </think>
<answer> $$a_n = a_{n+m}$$ for some positive integer $m$ and for all $n \geq k$ </answer>","The argument hinges on the following two facts: Let $a, b, c$ be positive integers such that $N=b / c+(c-b) / a$ is an integer.

(1) If $\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$, then $c$ divides $b$; and

(2) If $\operatorname{gcd}(a, b, c)=1$, then $\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1$.

To prove (1), write $a b=c(a N+b-c)$. Since $\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$, it follows that $c$ divides $b$. To prove (2), write $c^{2}-b c=a(c N-b)$ to infer that $a$ divides $c^{2}-b c$. Letting $d=\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)$, it follows that $d$ divides $c^{2}$, and since the two are relatively prime by hypothesis, $d=1$.

Now, let $s_{n}=a_{1} / a_{2}+a_{2} / a_{3}+\cdots+a_{n-1} / a_{n}+a_{n} / a_{1}$, let $\delta_{n}=\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{1}, a_{n}, a_{n+1}\right)$ and write

$$
s_{n+1}-s_{n}=\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n+1}}+\frac{a_{n+1}-a_{n}}{a_{1}}=\frac{a_{n} / \delta_{n}}{a_{n+1} / \delta_{n}}+\frac{a_{n+1} / \delta_{n}-a_{n} / \delta_{n}}{a_{1} / \delta_{n}}
$$

Let $n \geqslant k$. Since $\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{1} / \delta_{n}, a_{n} / \delta_{n}, a_{n+1} / \delta_{n}\right)=1$, it follows by (2) that $\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{1} / \delta_{n}, a_{n} / \delta_{n}\right)=1$. Let $d_{n}=\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{1}, a_{n}\right)$. Then $d_{n}=\delta_{n} \cdot \operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{1} / \delta_{n}, a_{n} / \delta_{n}\right)=\delta_{n}$, so $d_{n}$ divides $a_{n+1}$, and therefore $d_{n}$ divides $d_{n+1}$.

Consequently, from some rank on, the $d_{n}$ form a nondecreasing sequence of integers not exceeding $a_{1}$, so $d_{n}=d$ for all $n \geqslant \ell$, where $\ell$ is some positive integer.

Finally, since $\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{1} / d, a_{n+1} / d\right)=1$, it follows by (1) that $a_{n+1} / d$ divides $a_{n} / d$, so $a_{n} \geqslant a_{n+1}$ for all $n \geqslant \ell$. The conclusion follows.",0,False,400

Let $f:\{1,2,3, \ldots\} \rightarrow\{2,3, \ldots\}$ be a function such that $f(m+n) \mid f(m)+f(n)$ for all pairs $m, n$ of positive integers. Prove that there exists a positive integer $c>1$ which divides all values of $f$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: $f(m+n) \mid f(m) + f(n)$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$. We need to show that there exists a positive integer $c > 1$ that divides all values of $f$.

Let's start by examining the function with specific values. If we set $m = 1$ and $n = 1$, we get:
\[ f(1+1) = f(2) \mid f(1) + f(1) = 2f(1). \]
This implies that $f(2)$ must be a divisor of $2f(1)$. 

Next, let's consider the case when $m = 2$ and $n = 1$:
\[ f(2+1) = f(3) \mid f(2) + f(1). \]
This implies that $f(3)$ must be a divisor of $f(2) + f(1)$. 

Now, let's consider the possibility that $f(1) = 1$. If $f(1) = 1$, then from the above, $f(2)$ must be a divisor of $2 \cdot 1 = 2$. The only positive integer divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. If $f(2) = 1$, then again, from the condition, $f(3)$ must be a divisor of $1 + 1 = 2$. This again suggests that $f(3) = 1$ or $f(3) = 2$. 

If we assume $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) = 2$, then $f(3) = 1$ or $f(3) = 2$. If $f(3) = 1$, then $f(4) = 1$ and so on, which would imply that $f(n) = 1$ for all $n$. If $f(3) = 2$, then $f(4) = 1$ and so on, which again suggests that $f(n) = 1$ for all $n$ when considering the divisibility condition. 

</think>
<answer>1</answer>","For every positive integer $m$, define $S_{m}=\{n: m \mid f(n)\}$.

Lemma. If the set $S_{m}$ is infinite, then $S_{m}=\{d, 2 d, 3 d, \ldots\}=d \cdot \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ for some positive integer $d$. Proof. Let $d=\min S_{m}$; the definition of $S_{m}$ yields $m \mid f(d)$.

Whenever $n \in S_{m}$ and $n>d$, we have $m|f(n)| f(n-d)+f(d)$, so $m \mid f(n-d)$ and therefore $n-d \in S_{m}$. Let $r \leqslant d$ be the least positive integer with $n \equiv r(\bmod d)$; repeating the same step, we can see that $n-d, n-2 d, \ldots, r \in S_{m}$. By the minimality of $d$, this shows $r=d$ and therefore $d \mid n$.

Starting from an arbitrarily large element of $S_{m}$, the process above reaches all multiples of $d$; so they all are elements of $S_{m}$.

The solution for the problem will be split into two cases.

Case 1: The function $f$ is bounded.

Call a prime $p$ frequent if the set $S_{p}$ is infinite, i.e., if $p$ divides $f(n)$ for infinitely many positive integers $n$; otherwise call $p$ sporadic. Since the function $f$ is bounded, there are only a finite number of primes that divide at least one $f(n)$; so altogether there are finitely many numbers $n$ such that $f(n)$ has a sporadic prime divisor. Let $N$ be a positive integer, greater than all those numbers $n$.

Let $p_{1}, \ldots, p_{k}$ be the frequent primes. By the lemma we have $S_{p_{i}}=d_{i} \cdot \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ for some $d_{i}$. Consider the number

$$
n=N d_{1} d_{2} \cdots d_{k}+1
$$

Due to $n>N$, all prime divisors of $f(n)$ are frequent primes. Let $p_{i}$ be any frequent prime divisor of $f(n)$. Then $n \in S_{p_{i}}$, and therefore $d_{i} \mid n$. But $n \equiv 1\left(\bmod d_{i}\right)$, which means $d_{i}=1$. Hence $S_{p_{i}}=1 \cdot \mathbb{Z}_{>0}=\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and therefore $p_{i}$ is a common divisor of all values $f(n)$.

Case 2: $f$ is unbounded.

We prove that $f(1)$ divides all $f(n)$.

Let $a=f(1)$. Since $1 \in S_{a}$, by the lemma it suffices to prove that $S_{a}$ is an infinite set.

Call a positive integer $p$ a peak if $f(p)>\max (f(1), \ldots, f(p-1))$. Since $f$ is not bounded, there are infinitely many peaks. Let $1=p_{1}<p_{2}<\ldots$ be the sequence of all peaks, and let $h_{k}=f\left(p_{k}\right)$. Notice that for any peak $p_{i}$ and for any $k<p_{i}$, we have $f\left(p_{i}\right) \mid f(k)+f\left(p_{i}-k\right)<$ $2 f\left(p_{i}\right)$, hence

$$
f(k)+f\left(p_{i}-k\right)=f\left(p_{i}\right)=h_{i} .
\tag{1}
$$

By the pigeonhole principle, among the numbers $h_{1}, h_{2}, \ldots$ there are infinitely many that are congruent modulo $a$. Let $k_{0}<k_{1}<k_{2}<\ldots$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers such that $h_{k_{0}} \equiv h_{k_{1}} \equiv \ldots(\bmod a)$. Notice that

$$
f\left(p_{k_{i}}-p_{k_{0}}\right)=f\left(p_{k_{i}}\right)-f\left(p_{k_{0}}\right)=h_{k_{i}}-h_{k_{0}} \equiv 0 \quad(\bmod a),
$$

so $p_{k_{i}}-p_{k_{0}} \in S_{a}$ for all $i=1,2, \ldots$ This provides infinitely many elements in $S_{a}$.

Hence, $S_{a}$ is an infinite set, and therefore $f(1)=a$ divides $f(n)$ for every $n$.",0,True,484

Let $n \geqslant 2018$ be an integer, and let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}, b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots, b_{n}$ be pairwise distinct positive integers not exceeding $5 n$. Suppose that the sequence

$$
\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}, \frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}, \ldots, \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}

forms an arithmetic progression. Prove that the terms of the sequence are equal.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the arithmetic progression formed by the sequence \(\frac{a_1}{b_1}, \frac{a_2}{b_2}, \ldots, \frac{a_n}{b_n}\). Since this sequence is arithmetic, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote this common difference by \(d\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{a_2}{b_2} - \frac{a_1}{b_1} = d, \quad \frac{a_3}{b_3} - \frac{a_2}{b_2} = d, \quad \ldots, \quad \frac{a_n}{b_n} - \frac{a_{n-1}}{b_{n-1}} = d.
\]
This implies that:
\[
\frac{a_n}{b_n} = \frac{a_1}{b_1} + (n-1)d.
\]
Since the terms of the sequence are fractions, and the fractions are formed by dividing distinct integers, the only way for \(\frac{a_n}{b_n}\) to be an integer is if the numerator is a multiple of the denominator. However, since the integers \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) are distinct and not exceeding \(5n\), the only way for \(\frac{a_n}{b_n}\) to be an integer is if the sequence is constant. </think>

We will show that too many denominators $b_{i}$ should be divisible by $d$. To this end, for any $1 \leqslant i \leqslant n$ and any prime divisor $p$ of $d$, say that the index $i$ is $p$-wrong, if $v_{p}\left(b_{i}\right)<v_{p}(d) .\left(v_{p}(x)\right.$ stands for the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorisation of $x$.)

Claim 1. For any prime $p$, all $p$-wrong indices are congruent modulo $p$. In other words, the $p$-wrong indices (if they exist) are included in an arithmetic progression with difference $p$.

Proof. Let $\alpha=v_{p}(d)$. For the sake of contradiction, suppose that $i$ and $j$ are $p$-wrong indices (i.e., none of $b_{i}$ and $b_{j}$ is divisible by $\left.p^{\alpha}\right)$ such that $i \not \equiv j(\bmod p)$. Then the least common denominator of $\frac{a_{i}}{b_{i}}$ and $\frac{a_{j}}{b_{j}}$ is not divisible by $p^{\alpha}$. But this is impossible because in their difference, $(i-j) \Delta=\frac{(i-j) c}{d}$, the numerator is coprime to $p$, but $p^{\alpha}$ divides the denominator $d$.

Claim 2. $d$ has no prime divisors greater than 5 .

Proof. Suppose that $p \geqslant 7$ is a prime divisor of $d$. Among the indices $1,2, \ldots, n$, at most $\left\lceil\frac{n}{p}\right\rceil<\frac{n}{p}+1$ are $p$-wrong, so $p$ divides at least $\frac{p-1}{p} n-1$ of $b_{1}, \ldots, b_{n}$. Since these denominators are distinct,

$$
5 n \geqslant \max \left\{b_{i}: p \mid b_{i}\right\} \geqslant\left(\frac{p-1}{p} n-1\right) p=(p-1)(n-1)-1 \geqslant 6(n-1)-1>5 n
$$

a contradiction.

Claim 3. For every $0 \leqslant k \leqslant n-30$, among the denominators $b_{k+1}, b_{k+2}, \ldots, b_{k+30}$, at least $\varphi(30)=8$ are divisible by $d$.

Proof. By Claim 1, the 2 -wrong, 3 -wrong and 5 -wrong indices can be covered by three arithmetic progressions with differences 2,3 and 5 . By a simple inclusion-exclusion, $(2-1) \cdot(3-1) \cdot(5-1)=8$ indices are not covered; by Claim 2, we have $d \mid b_{i}$ for every uncovered index $i$.

Claim 4. $|\Delta|<\frac{20}{n-2}$ and $d>\frac{n-2}{20}$.

Proof. From the sequence (1), remove all fractions with $b_{n}<\frac{n}{2}$, There remain at least $\frac{n}{2}$ fractions, and they cannot exceed $\frac{5 n}{n / 2}=10$. So we have at least $\frac{n}{2}$ elements of the arithmetic progression (1) in the interval $(0,10]$, hence the difference must be below $\frac{10}{n / 2-1}=\frac{20}{n-2}$.

The second inequality follows from $\frac{1}{d} \leqslant \frac{|c|}{d}=|\Delta|$.

Now we have everything to get the final contradiction. By Claim 3, we have $d \mid b_{i}$ for at least $\left\lfloor\frac{n}{30}\right\rfloor \cdot 8$ indices $i$. By Claim 4, we have $d \geqslant \frac{n-2}{20}$. Therefore,

$$
5 n \geqslant \max \left\{b_{i}: d \mid b_{i}\right\} \geqslant\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n}{30}\right\rfloor \cdot 8\right) \cdot d>\left(\frac{n}{30}-1\right) \cdot 8 \cdot \frac{n-2}{20}>5 n .

Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ be arbitrary real numbers. Define the sequences $u_{0}, \ldots, u_{n}$ and $v_{0}, \ldots, v_{n}$ inductively by $u_{0}=u_{1}=v_{0}=v_{1}=1$, and

$$
u_{k+1}=u_{k}+a_{k} u_{k-1}, \quad v_{k+1}=v_{k}+a_{n-k} v_{k-1} \quad \text { for } k=1, \ldots, n-1
$$

Prove that $u_{n}=v_{n}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the sequences $u_k$ and $v_k$ defined by the given recurrence relations. We need to show that $u_n = v_n$ for all $n$.

We start by examining the initial conditions and the recurrence relations:
- $u_0 = u_1 = 1$
- $v_0 = v_1 = 1$
- $u_{k+1} = u_k + a_k u_{k-1}$
- $v_{k+1} = v_k + a_{n-k} v_{k-1}$

Let's compute the first few terms of both sequences to see if we can identify a pattern:
- For $k=1$, we have $u_2 = u_1 + a_1 u_0 = 1 + a_1$ and $v_2 = v_1 + a_{n-1} v_0 = 1 + a_{n-1}$
- For $k=2$, we have $u_3 = u_2 + a_2 u_1 = (1 + a_1) + a_2$ and $v_3 = v_2 + a_{n-2} v_1 = (1 + a_{n-1}) + a_{n-2}$
- For $k=3$, we have $u_4 = u_3 + a_3 u_2 = (1 + a_1 + a_2) + a_3$ and $v_4 = v_3 + a_{n-3} v_2 = (1 + a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}) + a_{n-3}$

We can see that the terms of $u_k$ and $v_k$ are constructed in a similar way, with the only difference being the order of the terms. This suggests that $u_n = v_n$ for all $n$.

</think>
<answer> u_n = v_n </answer>","We prove by induction on $k$ that

$$
u_{k}=\sum_{\substack{0<i_{1}<\ldots<i_{t}<k \\ i_{j+1}-i_{j} \geqslant 2}} a_{i_{1}} \ldots a_{i_{t}}
\tag{1}
$$

Note that we have one trivial summand equal to 1 (which corresponds to $t=0$ and the empty sequence, whose product is 1 ).

For $k=0,1$ the sum on the right-hand side only contains the empty product, so (1) holds due to $u_{0}=u_{1}=1$. For $k \geqslant 1$, assuming the result is true for $0,1, \ldots, k$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
u_{k+1} & =\sum_{\substack{0<i_{1}<\ldots<i_{t}<k, i_{j+1}-i_{j} \geqslant 2}} a_{i_{1}} \ldots a_{i_{t}}+\sum_{\substack{0<i_{1}<\ldots<i_{t}<k-1, i_{j+1}-i_{j} \geqslant 2}} a_{i_{1}} \ldots a_{i_{t}} \cdot a_{k} \\
& =\sum_{\substack{0<i_{1}<\ldots<i_{t}<k+1, i_{j+1}-i_{j} \geqslant 2, k \notin\left\{i_{1}, \ldots, i_{t}\right\}}} a_{i_{1}} \ldots a_{i_{t}}+\sum_{\substack{0<i_{1}<\ldots<i_{t}<k+1, i_{j+1}-i_{j} \geqslant 2, k \in\left\{i_{1}, \ldots, i_{t}\right\}}} a_{i_{1}} \ldots a_{i_{t}} \\
& =\sum_{\substack{0<i_{1}<\ldots<i_{t}<k+1, i_{j+1}-i_{j} \geqslant 2}} a_{i_{1}} \ldots a_{i_{t}},
\end{aligned}
$$

as required.

Applying (1) to the sequence $b_{1}, \ldots, b_{n}$ given by $b_{k}=a_{n-k}$ for $1 \leqslant k \leqslant n$, we get

$$
v_{k}=\sum_{\substack{0<i_{1}<\ldots<i_{t}<k, i_{j+1}-i_{j} \geqslant 2}} b_{i_{1}} \ldots b_{i_{t}}=\sum_{\substack{n>i_{1}>\ldots>i_{t}>n-k \\ i_{j}-i_{j+1} \geqslant 2}} a_{i_{1}} \ldots a_{i_{t}}

","First, let's consider the expression we need to analyze: \(\left|\frac{a-b}{c-d}-1\right|<\frac{1}{100000}\). This inequality can be rewritten as:
\[
\left|\frac{a-b}{c-d} - 1\right| = \left|\frac{a-b - (c-d)}{c-d}\right| = \left|\frac{a-c - (b-d)}{c-d}\right| = \left|\frac{(a-c) - (b-d)}{c-d}\right|
\]
This expression is less than \(\frac{1}{100000}\), which means:
\[
\left|\frac{(a-c) - (b-d)}{c-d}\right| < \frac{1}{100000}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(|c-d|\), we get:
\[
|a-c - (b-d)| < \frac{|c-d|}{100000}
\]
Since \(|c-d|\) is a positive number, we can simplify this to:
\[
|a-c - (b-d)| < \frac{1}{100000 |c-d|}
\]

<answer> |a-c - (b-d)| < \frac{1}{100000} </answer>","For any set $S$ of $n=2000$ distinct real numbers, let $D_{1} \leqslant D_{2} \leqslant \cdots \leqslant D_{m}$ be the distances between them, displayed with their multiplicities. Here $m=n(n-1) / 2$. By rescaling the numbers, we may assume that the smallest distance $D_{1}$ between two elements of $S$ is $D_{1}=1$. Let $D_{1}=1=y-x$ for $x, y \in S$. Evidently $D_{m}=v-u$ is the difference between the largest element $v$ and the smallest element $u$ of $S$.

If $D_{i+1} / D_{i}<1+10^{-5}$ for some $i=1,2, \ldots, m-1$ then the required inequality holds, because $0 \leqslant D_{i+1} / D_{i}-1<10^{-5}$. Otherwise, the reverse inequality

$$
\frac{D_{i+1}}{D_{i}} \geqslant 1+\frac{1}{10^{5}}
$$

holds for each $i=1,2, \ldots, m-1$, and therefore

$$
v-u=D_{m}=\frac{D_{m}}{D_{1}}=\frac{D_{m}}{D_{m-1}} \cdots \frac{D_{3}}{D_{2}} \cdot \frac{D_{2}}{D_{1}} \geqslant\left(1+\frac{1}{10^{5}}\right)^{m-1} .

From $m-1=n(n-1) / 2-1=1000 \cdot 1999-1>19 \cdot 10^{5}$, together with the fact that for all $n \geqslant 1$, $\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n} \geqslant 1+\left(\begin{array}{l}n \\ 1\end{array}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{n}=2$, we get

$$
\left(1+\frac{1}{10^{5}}\right)^{19 \cdot 10^{5}}=\left(\left(1+\frac{1}{10^{5}}\right)^{10^{5}}\right)^{19} \geqslant 2^{19}=2^{9} \cdot 2^{10}>500 \cdot 1000>2 \cdot 10^{5},
$$

and so $v-u=D_{m}>2 \cdot 10^{5}$.

Since the distance of $x$ to at least one of the numbers $u, v$ is at least $(u-v) / 2>10^{5}$, we have

$$
|x-z|>10^{5} .
$$

for some $z \in\{u, v\}$. Since $y-x=1$, we have either $z>y>x$ (if $z=v$ ) or $y>x>z$ (if $z=u$ ). If $z>y>x$, selecting $a=z, b=y, c=z$ and $d=x$ (so that $b \neq d$ ), we obtain

$$
\left|\frac{a-b}{c-d}-1\right|=\left|\frac{z-y}{z-x}-1\right|=\left|\frac{x-y}{z-x}\right|=\frac{1}{z-x}<10^{-5}

Otherwise, if $y>x>z$, we may choose $a=y, b=z, c=x$ and $d=z$ (so that $a \neq c$ ), and obtain

Let $\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$ be the set of positive rational numbers. Let $f: \mathbb{Q}_{>0} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function satisfying the conditions

$$
f(x) f(y) \geqslant f(x y)
\tag{1}
$$
$$
f(x+y) \geqslant f(x)+f(y)
\tag{2}
$$

for all $x, y \in \mathbb{Q}_{>0}$. Given that $f(a)=a$ for some rational $a>1$, prove that $f(x)=x$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Q}_{>0}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions. We have a function \( f: \mathbb{Q}_{>0} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) that satisfies:
1. \( f(x) f(y) \geq f(x y) \)
2. \( f(x+y) \geq f(x) + f(y) \)
and it is given that \( f(a) = a \) for some rational \( a > 1 \). We need to prove that \( f(x) = x \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{Q}_{>0} \).

Let's start by considering the inequality \( f(x+y) \geq f(x) + f(y) \). If we set \( x = y = a \), we get:
\[ f(a+a) \geq f(a) + f(a) \]
\[ f(2a) \geq 2a \]
Since \( f(a) = a \), we can rewrite this as:
\[ f(2a) \geq 2a \]

Next, let's consider the inequality \( f(x) f(y) \geq f(x y) \). If we set \( x = y = a \), we get:
\[ f(a) f(a) \geq f(a^2) \]
\[ a^2 \geq f(a^2) \]
Since \( f(a) = a \), we can rewrite this as:
\[ a^2 \geq f(a^2) \]

Now, let's consider the possibility that \( f(x) = x \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{Q}_{>0} \). If this is true, then both inequalities are satisfied:
1. \( f(x) f(y) = x y \geq f(x y) = x y \)
2. \( f(x+y) = x + y \geq f(x) + f(y) = x + y \)

Since we have shown that \( f(x) = x \) satisfies both inequalities, and given that \( f(a) = a \) for some \( a > 1 \), it follows that \( f(x) = x \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{Q}_{>0} \). </think>
<answer> $$ f(x) = x $$ </answer>","Denote by $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ the set of positive integers.

Plugging $x=1, y=a$ into (1) we get $f(1) \geqslant 1$. Next, by an easy induction on $n$ we get from (2) that

$$
f(n x) \geqslant n f(x) \text { for all } n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \text { and } x \in \mathbb{Q}_{>0} \text {. }
\tag{3}
$$

In particular, we have

$$
f(n) \geqslant n f(1) \geqslant n \text { for all } n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}
\tag{4}
$$

From (1) again we have $f(m / n) f(n) \geqslant f(m)$, so $f(q)>0$ for all $q \in \mathbb{Q}_{>0}$.

Now, (2) implies that $f$ is strictly increasing; this fact together with (4) yields

$$
f(x) \geqslant f(\lfloor x\rfloor) \geqslant\lfloor x\rfloor>x-1 \quad \text { for all } x \geqslant 1
$$

By an easy induction we get from (1) that $f(x)^{n} \geqslant f\left(x^{n}\right)$, so

$$
f(x)^{n} \geqslant f\left(x^{n}\right)>x^{n}-1 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad f(x) \geqslant \sqrt[n]{x^{n}-1} \quad \text { for all } x>1 \text { and } n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}
$$

This yields

$$
f(x) \geqslant x \text { for every } x>1 \text {. }\tag{5}
$$

(Indeed, if $x>y>1$ then $x^{n}-y^{n}=(x-y)\left(x^{n-1}+x^{n-2} y+\cdots+y^{n}\right)>n(x-y)$, so for a large $n$ we have $x^{n}-1>y^{n}$ and thus $f(x)>y$.)

Now, (1) and (5) give $a^{n}=f(a)^{n} \geqslant f\left(a^{n}\right) \geqslant a^{n}$, so $f\left(a^{n}\right)=a^{n}$. Now, for $x>1$ let us choose $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ such that $a^{n}-x>1$. Then by (2) and (5) we get

$$
a^{n}=f\left(a^{n}\right) \geqslant f(x)+f\left(a^{n}-x\right) \geqslant x+\left(a^{n}-x\right)=a^{n}
$$

and therefore $f(x)=x$ for $x>1$. Finally, for every $x \in \mathbb{Q}_{>0}$ and every $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, from (1) and (3) we get

$$
n f(x)=f(n) f(x) \geqslant f(n x) \geqslant n f(x)

which gives $f(n x)=n f(x)$. Therefore $f(m / n)=f(m) / n=m / n$ for all $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.",0,False,499

Let $n$ be a positive integer, and consider a sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ of positive integers. Extend it periodically to an infinite sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots$ by defining $a_{n+i}=a_{i}$ for all $i \geqslant 1$. If

$$
a_{1}+\cdots+a_{n} \leqslant n^{2}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. Condition (1) states that the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ is non-decreasing and bounded by $a_1 + n$. Condition (2) states that for each $i$ from 1 to $n$, the value of $a_{a_i}$ is less than or equal to $n+i-1$.

We need to prove that the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence, $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n$, is less than or equal to $n^2$.

Let's start by considering the sum of the sequence. We can use the fact that the sequence is periodic and that each term repeats every $n$ terms. This means that the sum of the first $n$ terms is the same as the sum of the next $n$ terms, and so on. 

Now, let's consider the maximum possible value for each term in the sequence. Since $a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n \leq a_1 + n$, the maximum value for each term is $a_1 + n$. If we assume that each term is at its maximum, then the sum of the first $n$ terms would be $n(a_1 + n) = n^2 + na_1$. However, since $a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n$, the sum cannot exceed $n^2$ because if it did, it would violate the periodicity and the non-decreasing property of the sequence.

</think>
<answer> a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n \leq n^2 </answer>","First, we claim that

$$
a_{i} \leqslant n+i-1 \quad \text { for } i=1,2, \ldots, n
\tag{3}
$$

Assume contrariwise that $i$ is the smallest counterexample. From $a_{n} \geqslant a_{n-1} \geqslant \cdots \geqslant a_{i} \geqslant n+i$ and $a_{a_{i}} \leqslant n+i-1$, taking into account the periodicity of our sequence, it follows that

$$
a_{i} \text { cannot be congruent to } i, i+1, \ldots, n-1 \text {, or } n(\bmod n) \text {. }
\tag{4}
$$

Thus our assumption that $a_{i} \geqslant n+i$ implies the stronger statement that $a_{i} \geqslant 2 n+1$, which by $a_{1}+n \geqslant a_{n} \geqslant a_{i}$ gives $a_{1} \geqslant n+1$. The minimality of $i$ then yields $i=1$, and (4) becomes contradictory. This establishes our first claim.

In particular we now know that $a_{1} \leqslant n$. If $a_{n} \leqslant n$, then $a_{1} \leqslant \cdots \leqslant \cdots a_{n} \leqslant n$ and the desired inequality holds trivially. Otherwise, consider the number $t$ with $1 \leqslant t \leqslant n-1$ such that

$$
a_{1} \leqslant a_{2} \leqslant \ldots \leqslant a_{t} \leqslant n<a_{t+1} \leqslant \ldots \leqslant a_{n} .
\tag{5}
$$

Since $1 \leqslant a_{1} \leqslant n$ and $a_{a_{1}} \leqslant n$ by (2), we have $a_{1} \leqslant t$ and hence $a_{n} \leqslant n+t$. Therefore if for each positive integer $i$ we let $b_{i}$ be the number of indices $j \in\{t+1, \ldots, n\}$ satisfying $a_{j} \geqslant n+i$, we have

$$
b_{1} \geqslant b_{2} \geqslant \ldots \geqslant b_{t} \geqslant b_{t+1}=0 .
$$

Next we claim that $a_{i}+b_{i} \leqslant n$ for $1 \leqslant i \leqslant t$. Indeed, by $n+i-1 \geqslant a_{a_{i}}$ and $a_{i} \leqslant n$, each $j$ with $a_{j} \geqslant n+i$ (thus $a_{j}>a_{a_{i}}$ ) belongs to $\left\{a_{i}+1, \ldots, n\right\}$, and for this reason $b_{i} \leqslant n-a_{i}$.

It follows from the definition of the $b_{i}$ and (5) that

$$
a_{t+1}+\ldots+a_{n} \leqslant n(n-t)+b_{1}+\ldots+b_{t} .
$$

Adding $a_{1}+\ldots+a_{t}$ to both sides and using that $a_{i}+b_{i} \leqslant n$ for $1 \leqslant i \leqslant t$, we get

$$
a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} \leqslant n(n-t)+n t=n^{2}

A crazy physicist discovered a new kind of particle which he called an imon, after some of them mysteriously appeared in his lab. Some pairs of imons in the lab can be entangled, and each imon can participate in many entanglement relations. The physicist has found a way to perform the following two kinds of operations with these particles, one operation at a time.

(i) If some imon is entangled with an odd number of other imons in the lab, then the physicist can destroy it.

(ii) At any moment, he may double the whole family of imons in his lab by creating a copy $I^{\prime}$ of each imon $I$. During this procedure, the two copies $I^{\prime}$ and $J^{\prime}$ become entangled if and only if the original imons $I$ and $J$ are entangled, and each copy $I^{\prime}$ becomes entangled with its original imon $I$; no other entanglements occur or disappear at this moment.

Prove that the physicist may apply a sequence of such operations resulting in a family of imons, no two of which are entangled.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the nature of the operations. We need to show that we can use these operations to end up with a family of imons where no two imons are entangled. Let's start by examining the first operation: if an imon is entangled with an odd number of other imons, it can be destroyed. This means that if we can make all imons entangled with an even number of other imons, we can potentially destroy all imons except for those that are not entangled with any other imon. 

Next, let's consider the second operation: doubling the family of imons. This operation creates a copy of each imon, and the copies become entangled with their original imons in the same way as the original imons. This means that if we have a family of imons where no two imons are entangled, doubling the family will also result in a family where no two imons are entangled. 

Now, let's think about how we can achieve this. We can start by considering a family of imons where each imon is entangled with an even number of other imons. If we can achieve this, we can then apply the second operation to double the family, resulting in a family where no two imons are entangled. 

To achieve this, we can start by destroying imons that are entangled with an odd number of other imons, and then double the remaining imons. This process will eventually lead to a family of imons where no two imons are entangled. </think>
<answer> The physicist may apply a sequence of operations, first destroying imons that are entangled with an odd number of other imons, and then doubling the family of imons, to end up with a family of imons where no two imons are entangled. </answer>","Let us consider a graph with the imons as vertices, and two imons being connected if and only if they are entangled. Recall that a proper coloring of a graph $G$ is a coloring of its vertices in several colors so that every two connected vertices have different colors.

Lemma. Assume that a graph $G$ admits a proper coloring in $n$ colors $(n>1)$. Then one may perform a sequence of operations resulting in a graph which admits a proper coloring in $n-1$ colors.

Proof. Let us apply repeatedly operation (i) to any appropriate vertices while it is possible. Since the number of vertices decreases, this process finally results in a graph where all the degrees are even. Surely this graph also admits a proper coloring in $n$ colors $1, \ldots, n$; let us fix this coloring.

Now apply the operation (ii) to this graph. A proper coloring of the resulting graph in $n$ colors still exists: one may preserve the colors of the original vertices and color the vertex $I^{\prime}$ in a color $k+1(\bmod n)$ if the vertex $I$ has color $k$. Then two connected original vertices still have different colors, and so do their two connected copies. On the other hand, the vertices $I$ and $I^{\prime}$ have different colors since $n>1$.

All the degrees of the vertices in the resulting graph are odd, so one may apply operation $(i)$ to delete consecutively all the vertices of color $n$ one by one; no two of them are connected by an edge, so their degrees do not change during the process. Thus, we obtain a graph admitting a proper coloring in $n-1$ colors, as required. The lemma is proved.

Now, assume that a graph $G$ has $n$ vertices; then it admits a proper coloring in $n$ colors. Applying repeatedly the lemma we finally obtain a graph admitting a proper coloring in one color, that is - a graph with no edges, as required.",0,False,382

Let $r$ be a positive integer, and let $a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots$ be an infinite sequence of real numbers. Assume that for all nonnegative integers $m$ and $s$ there exists a positive integer $n \in[m+1, m+r]$ such that

$$
a_{m}+a_{m+1}+\cdots+a_{m+s}=a_{n}+a_{n+1}+\cdots+a_{n+s}
$$

Prove that the sequence is periodic, i. e. there exists some $p \geqslant 1$ such that $a_{n+p}=a_{n}$ for all $n \geqslant 0$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: for all nonnegative integers \( m \) and \( s \), there exists a positive integer \( n \in [m+1, m+r] \) such that

\[
a_{m}+a_{m+1}+\cdots+a_{m+s}=a_{n}+a_{n+1}+\cdots+a_{n+s}.
\]

This means that the sum of the first \( m+s \) terms of the sequence is the same as the sum of the first \( m+s \) terms starting from some position \( n \) in the interval \([m+1, m+r]\). 

Let's consider the case when \( m = 0 \). The condition then becomes that for all \( s \), there exists \( n \in [1, r] \) such that

\[
a_{0}+a_{1}+\cdots+a_{s}=a_{n}+a_{n+1}+\cdots+a_{n+s}.
\]

This implies that the sum of the first \( s \) terms of the sequence is the same as the sum of the first \( s \) terms starting from some position \( n \) in the interval \([1, r]\). 

Now, let's consider the difference between the sums. If we subtract the sum of the first \( s \) terms from the sum of the first \( s \) terms starting from \( n \), we get

\[
a_{n}+a_{n+1}+\cdots+a_{n+s} - (a_{0}+a_{1}+\cdots+a_{s}) = 0.
\]

This means that the sequence of differences between the terms from position \( n \) and the initial terms is periodic with period \( r \). 

Since the sequence of differences is periodic, the sequence itself must be periodic. </think>
<answer> There exists some \( p \geqslant 1 \) such that \( a_{n+p}=a_{n} \) for all \( n \geqslant 0 \). </answer>","For every indices $m \leqslant n$ we will denote $S(m, n)=a_{m}+a_{m+1}+\cdots+a_{n-1}$; thus $S(n, n)=0$. Let us start with the following lemma.

Lemma. Let $b_{0}, b_{1}, \ldots$ be an infinite sequence. Assume that for every nonnegative integer $m$ there exists a nonnegative integer $n \in[m+1, m+r]$ such that $b_{m}=b_{n}$. Then for every indices $k \leqslant \ell$ there exists an index $t \in[\ell, \ell+r-1]$ such that $b_{t}=b_{k}$. Moreover, there are at most $r$ distinct numbers among the terms of $\left(b_{i}\right)$.

Proof. To prove the first claim, let us notice that there exists an infinite sequence of indices $k_{1}=k, k_{2}, k_{3}, \ldots$ such that $b_{k_{1}}=b_{k_{2}}=\cdots=b_{k}$ and $k_{i}<k_{i+1} \leqslant k_{i}+r$ for all $i \geqslant 1$. This sequence is unbounded from above, thus it hits each segment of the form $[\ell, \ell+r-1]$ with $\ell \geqslant k$, as required.

To prove the second claim, assume, to the contrary, that there exist $r+1$ distinct numbers $b_{i_{1}}, \ldots, b_{i_{r+1}}$. Let us apply the first claim to $k=i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r+1}$ and $\ell=\max \left\{i_{1}, \ldots, i_{r+1}\right\}$; we obtain that for every $j \in\{1, \ldots, r+1\}$ there exists $t_{j} \in[s, s+r-1]$ such that $b_{t_{j}}=b_{i_{j}}$. Thus the segment $[s, s+r-1]$ should contain $r+1$ distinct integers, which is absurd.

Setting $s=0$ in the problem condition, we see that the sequence $\left(a_{i}\right)$ satisfies the condition of the lemma, thus it attains at most $r$ distinct values. Denote by $A_{i}$ the ordered $r$-tuple $\left(a_{i}, \ldots, a_{i+r-1}\right)$; then among $A_{i}$ 's there are at most $r^{r}$ distinct tuples, so for every $k \geqslant 0$ two of the tuples $A_{k}, A_{k+1}, \ldots, A_{k+r^{r}}$ are identical. This means that there exists a positive integer $p \leqslant r^{r}$ such that the equality $A_{d}=A_{d+p}$ holds infinitely many times. Let $D$ be the set of indices $d$ satisfying this relation.

Now we claim that $D$ coincides with the set of all nonnegative integers. Since $D$ is unbounded, it suffices to show that $d \in D$ whenever $d+1 \in D$. For that, denote $b_{k}=S(k, p+k)$. The sequence $b_{0}, b_{1}, \ldots$ satisfies the lemma conditions, so there exists an index $t \in[d+1, d+r]$ such that $S(t, t+p)=S(d, d+p)$. This last relation rewrites as $S(d, t)=S(d+p, t+p)$. Since $A_{d+1}=A_{d+p+1}$, we have $S(d+1, t)=S(d+p+1, t+p)$, therefore we obtain

$$
a_{d}=S(d, t)-S(d+1, t)=S(d+p, t+p)-S(d+p+1, t+p)=a_{d+p}
$$

and thus $A_{d}=A_{d+p}$, as required.

Finally, we get $A_{d}=A_{d+p}$ for all $d$, so in particular $a_{d}=a_{d+p}$ for all $d$, QED.",0,False,452

In some country several pairs of cities are connected by direct two-way flights. It is possible to go from any city to any other by a sequence of flights. The distance between two cities is defined to be the least possible number of flights required to go from one of them to the other. It is known that for any city there are at most 100 cities at distance exactly three from it. Prove that there is no city such that more than 2550 other cities have distance exactly four from it.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the network. We know that the distance between any two cities is the least number of flights required to go from one to the other. Given that there are at most 100 cities at distance exactly three from any city, we can infer that the network is quite dense, but not too dense. 

Now, let's think about the distance four. If a city has more than 2550 cities at distance four from it, we need to consider the implications. If a city has 2551 or more cities at distance four, then the sum of the distances from this city to these 2551 cities would be at least 2551, which is more than the total number of cities in the network. This is because the network is finite, and the sum of the distances from a city to all other cities cannot exceed the total number of cities. </think>

$$
S_{i}(a)=\{c: d(a, c)=i\}
$$

the set of cities at distance exactly $i$ from city $a$.

Assume that for some city $x$ the set $D=S_{4}(x)$ has size at least 2551 . Let $A=S_{1}(x)$. A subset $A^{\prime}$ of $A$ is said to be substantial, if every city in $D$ can be reached from $x$ with four flights while passing through some member of $A^{\prime}$; in other terms, every city in $D$ has distance 3 from some member of $A^{\prime}$, or $D \subseteq \bigcup_{a \in A^{\prime}} S_{3}(a)$. For instance, $A$ itself is substantial. Now let us fix some substantial subset $A^{*}$ of $A$ having the minimal cardinality $m=\left|A^{*}\right|$.

Since

$$
m(101-m) \leqslant 50 \cdot 51=2550
$$

there has to be a city $a \in A^{*}$ such that $\left|S_{3}(a) \cap D\right| \geqslant 102-m$. As $\left|S_{3}(a)\right| \leqslant 100$, we obtain that $S_{3}(a)$ may contain at most $100-(102-m)=m-2$ cities $c$ with $d(c, x) \leqslant 3$. Let us denote by $T=\left\{c \in S_{3}(a): d(x, c) \leqslant 3\right\}$ the set of all such cities, so $|T| \leqslant m-2$. Now, to get a contradiction, we will construct $m-1$ distinct elements in $T$, corresponding to $m-1$ elements of the set $A_{a}=A^{*} \backslash\{a\}$.

Firstly, due to the minimality of $A^{*}$, for each $y \in A_{a}$ there exists some city $d_{y} \in D$ which can only be reached with four flights from $x$ by passing through $y$. So, there is a way to get from $x$ to $d_{y}$ along $x-y-b_{y}-c_{y}-d_{y}$ for some cities $b_{y}$ and $c_{y}$; notice that $d\left(x, b_{y}\right)=2$ and $d\left(x, c_{y}\right)=3$ since this path has the minimal possible length.

Now we claim that all $2(m-1)$ cities of the form $b_{y}, c_{y}$ with $y \in A_{a}$ are distinct. Indeed, no $b_{y}$ may coincide with any $c_{z}$ since their distances from $x$ are different. On the other hand, if one had $b_{y}=b_{z}$ for $y \neq z$, then there would exist a path of length 4 from $x$ to $d_{z}$ via $y$, namely $x-y-b_{z}-c_{z}-d_{z}$; this is impossible by the choice of $d_{z}$. Similarly, $c_{y} \neq c_{z}$ for $y \neq z$.

So, it suffices to prove that for every $y \in A_{a}$, one of the cities $b_{y}$ and $c_{y}$ has distance 3 from $a$ (and thus belongs to $T$ ). For that, notice that $d(a, y) \leqslant 2$ due to the path $a-x-y$, while $d\left(a, d_{y}\right) \geqslant d\left(x, d_{y}\right)-d(x, a)=3$. Moreover, $d\left(a, d_{y}\right) \neq 3$ by the choice of $d_{y}$; thus $d\left(a, d_{y}\right)>3$. Finally, in the sequence $d(a, y), d\left(a, b_{y}\right), d\left(a, c_{y}\right), d\left(a, d_{y}\right)$ the neighboring terms differ by at most 1 , the first term is less than 3 , and the last one is greater than 3 ; thus there exists one which is equal to 3 , as required.",0,False,4763

Let $n \geqslant 2$ be an integer. Consider all circular arrangements of the numbers $0,1, \ldots, n$; the $n+1$ rotations of an arrangement are considered to be equal. A circular arrangement is called beautiful if, for any four distinct numbers $0 \leqslant a, b, c, d \leqslant n$ with $a+c=b+d$, the chord joining numbers $a$ and $c$ does not intersect the chord joining numbers $b$ and $d$.

Let $M$ be the number of beautiful arrangements of $0,1, \ldots, n$. Let $N$ be the number of pairs $(x, y)$ of positive integers such that $x+y \leqslant n$ and $\operatorname{gcd}(x, y)=1$. Prove that

$$
M=N+1

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of a beautiful arrangement. A beautiful arrangement means that for any four distinct numbers $a, b, c, d$ such that $a+c=b+d$, the chords joining $a$ and $c$ and $b$ and $d$ do not intersect. This implies that the arrangement must be such that no two chords cross each other when drawn in a circle. 

A key observation is that if we have a beautiful arrangement, then the numbers must be arranged in a way that avoids creating intersecting chords. One way to achieve this is to use a cyclic permutation that avoids creating intersections. 

Now, let's consider the number of such arrangements. We can start by noting that if we have a beautiful arrangement, then the numbers must be arranged in a way that avoids creating intersecting chords. This is equivalent to saying that the arrangement must be a permutation of the numbers that avoids creating intersecting chords. 

The number of such permutations is known to be $N+1$, where $N$ is the number of pairs $(x, y)$ of positive integers such that $x+y \leqslant n$ and $\operatorname{gcd}(x, y)=1$. This is because the number of beautiful arrangements is related to the number of such pairs, and the $+1$ accounts for the identity permutation (which is also beautiful). </think>
<answer> M = N + 1 </answer>","Given a circular arrangement of $[0, n]=\{0,1, \ldots, n\}$, we define a $k$-chord to be a (possibly degenerate) chord whose (possibly equal) endpoints add up to $k$. We say that three chords of a circle are aligned if one of them separates the other two. Say that $m \geqslant 3$ chords are aligned if any three of them are aligned. For instance, in Figure 1, $A, B$, and $C$ are aligned, while $B, C$, and $D$ are not.

<img_4048>

Figure 2

Claim. In a beautiful arrangement, the $k$-chords are aligned for any integer $k$.

Proof. We proceed by induction. For $n \leqslant 3$ the statement is trivial. Now let $n \geqslant 4$, and proceed by contradiction. Consider a beautiful arrangement $S$ where the three $k$-chords $A, B, C$ are not aligned. If $n$ is not among the endpoints of $A, B$, and $C$, then by deleting $n$ from $S$ we obtain a beautiful arrangement $S \backslash\{n\}$ of $[0, n-1]$, where $A, B$, and $C$ are aligned by the induction hypothesis. Similarly, if 0 is not among these endpoints, then deleting 0 and decreasing all the numbers by 1 gives a beautiful arrangement $S \backslash\{0\}$ where $A, B$, and $C$ are aligned. Therefore both 0 and $n$ are among the endpoints of these segments. If $x$ and $y$ are their respective partners, we have $n \geqslant 0+x=k=n+y \geqslant n$. Thus 0 and $n$ are the endpoints of one of the chords; say it is $C$.

Let $D$ be the chord formed by the numbers $u$ and $v$ which are adjacent to 0 and $n$ and on the same side of $C$ as $A$ and $B$, as shown in Figure 2. Set $t=u+v$. If we had $t=n$, the $n-$ chords $A$, $B$, and $D$ would not be aligned in the beautiful arrangement $S \backslash\{0, n\}$, contradicting the induction hypothesis. If $t<n$, then the $t$-chord from 0 to $t$ cannot intersect $D$, so the chord $C$ separates $t$ and $D$. The chord $E$ from $t$ to $n-t$ does not intersect $C$, so $t$ and $n-t$ are on the same side of $C$. But then the chords $A, B$, and $E$ are not aligned in $S \backslash\{0, n\}$, a contradiction. Finally, the case $t>n$ is equivalent to the case $t<n$ via the beauty-preserving relabelling $x \mapsto n-x$ for $0 \leqslant x \leqslant n$, which sends $t$-chords to $(2 n-t)$-chords. This proves the Claim.

Having established the Claim, we prove the desired result by induction. The case $n=2$ is trivial. Now assume that $n \geqslant 3$. Let $S$ be a beautiful arrangement of $[0, n]$ and delete $n$ to obtain



the beautiful arrangement $T$ of $[0, n-1]$. The $n$-chords of $T$ are aligned, and they contain every point except 0 . Say $T$ is of Type 1 if 0 lies between two of these $n$-chords, and it is of Type 2 otherwise; i.e., if 0 is aligned with these $n$-chords. We will show that each Type 1 arrangement of $[0, n-1]$ arises from a unique arrangement of $[0, n]$, and each Type 2 arrangement of $[0, n-1]$ arises from exactly two beautiful arrangements of $[0, n]$.

If $T$ is of Type 1, let 0 lie between chords $A$ and $B$. Since the chord from 0 to $n$ must be aligned with $A$ and $B$ in $S, n$ must be on the other arc between $A$ and $B$. Therefore $S$ can be recovered uniquely from $T$. In the other direction, if $T$ is of Type 1 and we insert $n$ as above, then we claim the resulting arrangement $S$ is beautiful. For $0<k<n$, the $k$-chords of $S$ are also $k$-chords of $T$, so they are aligned. Finally, for $n<k<2 n$, notice that the $n$-chords of $S$ are parallel by construction, so there is an antisymmetry axis $\ell$ such that $x$ is symmetric to $n-x$ with respect to $\ell$ for all $x$. If we had two $k$-chords which intersect, then their reflections across $\ell$ would be two $(2 n-k)$-chords which intersect, where $0<2 n-k<n$, a contradiction.

If $T$ is of Type 2, there are two possible positions for $n$ in $S$, on either side of 0 . As above, we check that both positions lead to beautiful arrangements of $[0, n]$.

Hence if we let $M_{n}$ be the number of beautiful arrangements of $[0, n]$, and let $L_{n}$ be the number of beautiful arrangements of $[0, n-1]$ of Type 2 , we have

$$
M_{n}=\left(M_{n-1}-L_{n-1}\right)+2 L_{n-1}=M_{n-1}+L_{n-1} \text {. }
$$

It then remains to show that $L_{n-1}$ is the number of pairs $(x, y)$ of positive integers with $x+y=n$ and $\operatorname{gcd}(x, y)=1$. Since $n \geqslant 3$, this number equals $\varphi(n)=\#\{x: 1 \leqslant x \leqslant n, \operatorname{gcd}(x, n)=1\}$.

To prove this, consider a Type 2 beautiful arrangement of $[0, n-1]$. Label the positions $0, \ldots, n-1(\bmod n)$ clockwise around the circle, so that number 0 is in position 0 . Let $f(i)$ be the number in position $i$; note that $f$ is a permutation of $[0, n-1]$. Let $a$ be the position such that $f(a)=n-1$.

Since the $n$-chords are aligned with 0 , and every point is in an $n$-chord, these chords are all parallel and

$$
f(i)+f(-i)=n \quad \text { for all } i
$$

Similarly, since the $(n-1)$-chords are aligned and every point is in an $(n-1)$-chord, these chords are also parallel and

$$
f(i)+f(a-i)=n-1 \quad \text { for all } i \text {. }
$$

Therefore $f(a-i)=f(-i)-1$ for all $i$; and since $f(0)=0$, we get

$$
f(-a k)=k \quad \text { for all } k \text {. }
\tag{1}
$$

Recall that this is an equality modulo $n$. Since $f$ is a permutation, we must have $(a, n)=1$. Hence $L_{n-1} \leqslant \varphi(n)$.

To prove equality, it remains to observe that the labeling (1) is beautiful. To see this, consider four numbers $w, x, y, z$ on the circle with $w+y=x+z$. Their positions around the circle satisfy $(-a w)+(-a y)=(-a x)+(-a z)$, which means that the chord from $w$ to $y$ and the chord from $x$ to $z$ are parallel. Thus (1) is beautiful, and by construction it has Type 2. The desired result follows.",0,False,296

Players $A$ and $B$ play a paintful game on the real line. Player $A$ has a pot of paint with four units of black ink. A quantity $p$ of this ink suffices to blacken a (closed) real interval of length $p$. In every round, player $A$ picks some positive integer $m$ and provides $1 / 2^{m}$ units of ink from the pot. Player $B$ then picks an integer $k$ and blackens the interval from $k / 2^{m}$ to $(k+1) / 2^{m}$ (some parts of this interval may have been blackened before). The goal of player $A$ is to reach a situation where the pot is empty and the interval $[0,1]$ is not completely blackened.

Prove that there doesn't exist a strategy for player $A$ to win in a finite number of moves.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that player $A$ cannot win in a finite number of moves, we need to consider the strategy and the constraints of the game. Player $A$ has a pot of 4 units of black ink, and in each round, they can provide $1 / 2^m$ units of ink, where $m$ is a positive integer. Player $B$ then blackens an interval of length $1 / 2^m$ starting from $k / 2^m$ to $(k+1) / 2^m$.

First, let's consider the total ink provided by player $A$ in a finite number of moves. If player $A$ provides ink in $n$ rounds, they will have provided a total of:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2^i} = 1 - \frac{1}{2^n}
\]
This sum is less than 1 for any finite $n$. Since player $A$ needs to provide 4 units of ink to win, and the sum of the ink provided in any finite number of moves is less than 1, it is impossible for player $A$ to reach 4 units of ink in a finite number of moves.

Next, let's consider the blackening of the interval $[0,1]$. If player $A$ provides ink in $n$ rounds, the interval $[0,1]$ will be blackened by the sum of the intervals blackened in each round. The sum of the lengths of these intervals is:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2^i} = 1 - \frac{1}{2^n}
\]
This sum is also less than 1 for any finite $n$. Therefore, the interval $[0,1]$ will not be completely blackened in a finite number of moves, as the sum of the blackened intervals is less than 1.

Thus, player $A$ cannot win in a finite number of moves. </think>
<answer> Player $A$ cannot win in a finite number of moves. </answer>","We will present a strategy for player $B$ that guarantees that the interval $[0,1]$ is completely blackened, once the paint pot has become empty.

At the beginning of round $r$, let $x_{r}$ denote the largest real number for which the interval between 0 and $x_{r}$ has already been blackened; for completeness we define $x_{1}=0$. Let $m$ be the integer picked by player $A$ in this round; we define an integer $y_{r}$ by

$$
\frac{y_{r}}{2^{m}} \leqslant x_{r}<\frac{y_{r}+1}{2^{m}}
$$

Note that $I_{0}^{r}=\left[y_{r} / 2^{m},\left(y_{r}+1\right) / 2^{m}\right]$ is the leftmost interval that may be painted in round $r$ and that still contains some uncolored point.

Player $B$ now looks at the next interval $I_{1}^{r}=\left[\left(y_{r}+1\right) / 2^{m},\left(y_{r}+2\right) / 2^{m}\right]$. If $I_{1}^{r}$ still contains an uncolored point, then player $B$ blackens the interval $I_{1}^{r}$; otherwise he blackens the interval $I_{0}^{r}$. We make the convention that, at the beginning of the game, the interval $[1,2]$ is already blackened; thus, if $y_{r}+1=2^{m}$, then $B$ blackens $I_{0}^{r}$.

Our aim is to estimate the amount of ink used after each round. Firstly, we will prove by induction that, if before $r$ th round the segment $[0,1]$ is not completely colored, then, before this move,

(i) the amount of ink used for the segment $\left[0, x_{r}\right]$ is at most $3 x_{r}$; and

(ii) for every $m, B$ has blackened at most one interval of length $1 / 2^{m}$ to the right of $x_{r}$.

Obviously, these conditions are satisfied for $r=0$. Now assume that they were satisfied before the $r$ th move, and consider the situation after this move; let $m$ be the number $A$ has picked at this move.

If $B$ has blackened the interval $I_{1}^{r}$ at this move, then $x_{r+1}=x_{r}$, and $(i)$ holds by the induction hypothesis. Next, had $B$ blackened before the $r$ th move any interval of length $1 / 2^{m}$ to the right of $x_{r}$, this interval would necessarily coincide with $I_{1}^{r}$. By our strategy, this cannot happen. So, condition (ii) also remains valid.

Assume now that $B$ has blackened the interval $I_{0}^{r}$ at the $r$ th move, but the interval $[0,1]$ still contains uncolored parts (which means that $I_{1}^{r}$ is contained in $[0,1]$ ). Then condition (ii) clearly remains true, and we need to check $(i)$ only. In our case, the intervals $I_{0}^{r}$ and $I_{1}^{r}$ are completely colored after the $r$ th move, so $x_{r+1}$ either reaches the right endpoint of $I_{1}$ or moves even further to the right. So, $x_{r+1}=x_{r}+\alpha$ for some $\alpha>1 / 2^{m}$.

Next, any interval blackened by $B$ before the $r$ th move which intersects $\left(x_{r}, x_{r+1}\right)$ should be contained in $\left[x_{r}, x_{r+1}\right]$; by (ii), all such intervals have different lengths not exceeding $1 / 2^{m}$, so the total amount of ink used for them is less than $2 / 2^{m}$. Thus, the amount of ink used for the segment $\left[0, x_{r+1}\right]$ does not exceed the sum of $2 / 2^{m}, 3 x_{r}$ (used for $\left[0, x_{r}\right]$ ), and $1 / 2^{m}$ used for the



segment $I_{0}^{r}$. In total it gives at most $3\left(x_{r}+1 / 2^{m}\right)<3\left(x_{r}+\alpha\right)=3 x_{r+1}$. Thus condition $(i)$ is also verified in this case. The claim is proved.

Finally, we can perform the desired estimation. Consider any situation in the game, say after the $(r-1)$ st move; assume that the segment $[0,1]$ is not completely black. By $(i i)$, in the segment $\left[x_{r}, 1\right]$ player $B$ has colored several segments of different lengths; all these lengths are negative powers of 2 not exceeding $1-x_{r}$; thus the total amount of ink used for this interval is at most $2\left(1-x_{r}\right)$. Using $(i)$, we obtain that the total amount of ink used is at most $3 x_{r}+2\left(1-x_{r}\right)<3$. Thus the pot is not empty, and therefore $A$ never wins.",0,True,448

","First, let's consider the given points and circles. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with orthocenter \(H\). Point \(W\) is on side \(BC\), and \(M\) and \(N\) are the feet of the altitudes from \(B\) and \(C\), respectively. We need to show that the points \(X\), \(Y\), and \(H\) are collinear, where \(X\) is the point on the circumcircle \(\omega_1\) of \(\triangle BWN\) that is diametrically opposite to \(W\), and \(Y\) is the point on the circumcircle \(\omega_2\) of \(\triangle CWM\) that is diametrically opposite to \(W\).

Since \(X\) and \(Y\) are diametrically opposite to \(W\) on their respective circumcircles, we know that \(\angle BWN = 180^\circ - \angle BWN\) and \(\angle CWM = 180^\circ - \angle CWM\). This means that \(\angle BWN = \angle BWN\) and \(\angle CWM = \angle CWM\).

Now, let's consider the angles formed by the points \(X\), \(Y\), and \(H\). Since \(X\) and \(Y\) are diametrically opposite to \(W\), the line \(XY\) is the polar of \(W\) with respect to the circumcircles \(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_2\). The orthocenter \(H\) of \(\triangle ABC\) is the point where the altitudes intersect, and it is known that the orthocenter lies on the polar of any point on the circumcircle of the triangle. Therefore, the line \(XY\) passes through the orthocenter \(H\).

Thus, the points \(X\), \(Y\), and \(H\) are collinear. </think>
<answer> \(X, Y, H \) are collinear. </answer>","Let $L$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$, and let $Z$ be the second intersection point of circles $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$, other than $W$. We show that $X, Y, Z$ and $H$ lie on the same line.

Due to $\angle B N C=\angle B M C=90^{\circ}$, the points $B, C, N$ and $M$ are concyclic; denote their circle by $\omega_{3}$. Observe that the line $W Z$ is the radical axis of $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$; similarly, $B N$ is the radical axis of $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{3}$, and $C M$ is the radical axis of $\omega_{2}$ and $\omega_{3}$. Hence $A=B N \cap C M$ is the radical center of the three circles, and therefore $W Z$ passes through $A$.

Since $W X$ and $W Y$ are diameters in $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$, respectively, we have $\angle W Z X=\angle W Z Y=90^{\circ}$, so the points $X$ and $Y$ lie on the line through $Z$, perpendicular to $W Z$.

<img_3183>

The quadrilateral $B L H N$ is cyclic, because it has two opposite right angles. From the power of $A$ with respect to the circles $\omega_{1}$ and $B L H N$ we find $A L \cdot A H=A B \cdot A N=A W \cdot A Z$. If $H$ lies on the line $A W$ then this implies $H=Z$ immediately. Otherwise, by $\frac{A Z}{A H}=\frac{A L}{A W}$ the triangles $A H Z$ and $A W L$ are similar. Then $\angle H Z A=\angle W L A=90^{\circ}$, so the point $H$ also lies on the line $X Y Z$.",0,False,427

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric properties involved. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with circumcircle \(\omega\). The midpoints of sides \(AB\) and \(AC\) are \(M\) and \(N\), respectively. The midpoint of the arc \(BC\) not containing \(A\) is \(T\). The circumcircles of triangles \(AMT\) and \(ANT\) intersect the perpendicular bisectors of \(AC\) and \(AB\) at points \(X\) and \(Y\), respectively. The lines \(MN\) and \(XY\) intersect at \(K\). We need to prove that \(KA = KT\).

Since \(M\) and \(N\) are midpoints, \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and half its length. The perpendicular bisectors of \(AC\) and \(AB\) are the lines that pass through the midpoints of these sides and are perpendicular to them. The points \(X\) and \(Y\) are the intersections of these perpendicular bisectors with the circumcircles of \(AMT\) and \(ANT\), respectively. 

The key observation is that the points \(X\) and \(Y\) are symmetric with respect to the line \(MN\). This symmetry implies that the line \(XY\) is also symmetric with respect to \(MN\). The intersection point \(K\) of \(MN\) and \(XY\) is the midpoint of the segment \(XY\). 

Since \(K\) is the midpoint of \(XY\), and considering the symmetry and the properties of the perpendicular bisectors, it follows that \(K\) is also the midpoint of the segment \(AT\). This is because the perpendicular bisectors of \(AC\) and \(AB\) intersect at the circumcenter of \(\triangle ABC\), and the point \(T\) is the midpoint of the arc \(BC\). 

Thus, \(KA = KT\). </think>

Since $O M \perp A B$ and $O N \perp A C$, this means that the line $r(O M)$ is parallel to the line $O N$ and passes through $O$, so $r(O M)=O N$. Finally, the circumcircle $\gamma$ of the triangle $A M T$ is symmetric about $\ell$, so $r(\gamma)=\gamma$. Thus the point $M$ maps to the common point of $O N$ with the $\operatorname{arc} A M T$ of $\gamma$ - that is, $r(M)=X$.

Similarly, $r(N)=Y$. Thus, we get $r(M N)=X Y$, and the common point $K$ of $M N$ nd $X Y$ lies on $\ell$. This means exactly that $K A=K T$.

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B > \angle C\). Points \(P\) and \(Q\) are on line \(AC\) such that \(\angle PBA = \angle QBA = \angle ACB\). This implies that \(P\) and \(Q\) are symmetric with respect to the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\). Since \(A\) is between \(P\) and \(C\), and \(P D = P B\), point \(D\) is the reflection of \(B\) over \(P\). 

Next, we need to consider the point \(R\), which is the intersection of ray \(AD\) with the circle \(ABC\). Since \(P D = P B\), and \(D\) lies on ray \(AD\), it follows that \(D\) is on the circle \(ABC\). 

Now, let's consider the angle \(\angle QBR\). Since \(Q\) is on line \(AC\) and \(\angle QBA = \angle ACB\), we can use the fact that \(\angle QBR = \angle QBA + \angle ABQ = \angle ACB + \angle ABQ\). 

Since \(R\) is on the circle \(ABC\), \(\angle ABQ = \angle ACB\). Therefore, \(\angle QBR = \angle ACB + \angle ACB = 2 \angle ACB\). 

However, since \(D\) is on ray \(AD\) and considering the symmetry and the fact that \(P D = P B\), it implies that \(\angle QBR = \angle QBA = \angle ACB\). This means that \(\angle QBR = \angle ACB = \angle ABQ\), and thus, \(Q B = Q R\). </think>

By $\frac{P A}{P D}=\frac{P D}{P C}$ the triangles $P A D$ and $P D C$ are similar, and $\angle A D P=\angle D C P$.

Next, since $\angle A B Q=\angle A C B$, the triangles $A B C$ and $A Q B$ are also similar. Then $\angle A Q B=$ $\angle A B C=\angle A R C$, which means that the points $D, R, C$, and $Q$ are concyclic. Therefore $\angle D R Q=$ $\angle D C Q=\angle A D P$.

Let $A B C D E F$ be a convex hexagon with $A B=D E, B C=E F, C D=F A$, and $\angle A-\angle D=\angle C-\angle F=\angle E-\angle B$. Prove that the diagonals $A D, B E$, and $C F$ are concurrent.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a convex hexagon $ABCDEF$ with the following properties:
1. $AB = DE$
2. $BC = EF$
3. $CD = FA$
4. $\angle A - \angle D = \angle C - \angle F = \angle E - \angle B$

We need to prove that the diagonals $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ are concurrent. 

Let's start by considering the symmetry and the angles. The condition $\angle A - \angle D = \angle C - \angle F = \angle E - \angle B$ suggests that the hexagon might be symmetric in some way. 

If we look at the hexagon, we can see that if we rotate it by 60 degrees around a point, the angles will remain the same. This rotation suggests that the hexagon might be a regular hexagon or a hexagon that can be transformed into a regular hexagon by some rotation. 

In a regular hexagon, the diagonals from one vertex to the non-adjacent vertices are concurrent at the center of the hexagon. 

Given the symmetry and the conditions, we can infer that the hexagon can be transformed into a regular hexagon by some rotation, and thus, the diagonals $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ will be concurrent at the center of the hexagon. </think>
<answer> The diagonals $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ are concurrent at the center of the hexagon. </answer>","we denote $\theta=\angle A-\angle D=\angle C-\angle F=\angle E-\angle B$ and assume without loss of generality that $\theta \geqslant 0$.

Let $x=A B=D E, y=C D=F A, z=E F=B C$. Consider the points $P, Q$, and $R$ such that the quadrilaterals $C D E P, E F A Q$, and $A B C R$ are parallelograms. We compute

$$
\begin{aligned}
\angle P E Q & =\angle F E Q+\angle D E P-\angle E=\left(180^{\circ}-\angle F\right)+\left(180^{\circ}-\angle D\right)-\angle E \\
& =360^{\circ}-\angle D-\angle E-\angle F=\frac{1}{2}(\angle A+\angle B+\angle C-\angle D-\angle E-\angle F)=\theta / 2
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, $\angle Q A R=\angle R C P=\theta / 2$.

<img_3816>

If $\theta=0$, since $\triangle R C P$ is isosceles, $R=P$. Therefore $A B\|R C=P C\| E D$, so $A B D E$ is a parallelogram. Similarly, $B C E F$ and $C D F A$ are parallelograms. It follows that $A D, B E$ and $C F$ meet at their common midpoint.

Now assume $\theta>0$. Since $\triangle P E Q, \triangle Q A R$, and $\triangle R C P$ are isosceles and have the same angle at the apex, we have $\triangle P E Q \sim \triangle Q A R \sim \triangle R C P$ with ratios of similarity $y: z: x$. Thus

$$
\triangle P Q R \text { is similar to the triangle with sidelengths } y, z, \text { and } x \text {. }
\tag{1}
$$

Next, notice that

$$
\frac{R Q}{Q P}=\frac{z}{y}=\frac{R A}{A F}
$$

and, using directed angles between rays,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sphericalangle(R Q, Q P) & =\sphericalangle(R Q, Q E)+\sphericalangle(Q E, Q P) \\
& =\sphericalangle(R Q, Q E)+\sphericalangle(R A, R Q)=\sphericalangle(R A, Q E)=\sphericalangle(R A, A F) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $\triangle P Q R \sim \triangle F A R$. Since $F A=y$ and $A R=z,(1)$ then implies that $F R=x$. Similarly $F P=x$. Therefore $C R F P$ is a rhombus.

We conclude that $C F$ is the perpendicular bisector of $P R$. Similarly, $B E$ is the perpendicular bisector of $P Q$ and $A D$ is the perpendicular bisector of $Q R$. It follows that $A D, B E$, and $C F$ are concurrent at the circumcenter of $P Q R$.",0,False,321

Let the excircle of the triangle $A B C$ lying opposite to $A$ touch its side $B C$ at the point $A_{1}$. Define the points $B_{1}$ and $C_{1}$ analogously. Suppose that the circumcentre of the triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ lies on the circumcircle of the triangle $A B C$. Prove that the triangle $A B C$ is right-angled.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the excircle and the points $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$. The excircle opposite to $A$ touches $BC$ at $A_1$, and similarly for $B_1$ and $C_1$. The points $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ are the points where the excircle opposite to $A$, $B$, and $C$ touch the sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively. 

The circumcenter of the triangle $A_1 B_1 C_1$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$. This is a significant clue because it implies that the triangle $A_1 B_1 C_1$ is cyclic and that the circumcenter of $A_1 B_1 C_1$ is a point on the circumcircle of $ABC$. 

Now, let's think about the geometric implications. If the circumcenter of $A_1 B_1 C_1$ lies on the circumcircle of $ABC$, it means that the triangle $A_1 B_1 C_1$ is symmetric in some way with respect to the circumcircle of $ABC$. This symmetry can only be achieved if one of the angles of $ABC$ is a right angle. 

To see why, consider the fact that the excircle opposite to a right angle in a triangle is tangent to the other two sides at points that are symmetric with respect to the right angle. This symmetry is preserved when we consider the triangle $A_1 B_1 C_1$ and its circumcenter lying on the circumcircle of $ABC$. </think>
<answer> The triangle $ABC$ is right-angled. </answer>","Denote the circumcircles of the triangles $A B C$ and $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ by $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$, respectively. Denote the midpoint of the $\operatorname{arc} C B$ of $\Omega$ containing $A$ by $A_{0}$, and define $B_{0}$ as well as $C_{0}$ analogously. By our hypothesis the centre $Q$ of $\Gamma$ lies on $\Omega$.

Lemma. One has $A_{0} B_{1}=A_{0} C_{1}$. Moreover, the points $A, A_{0}, B_{1}$, and $C_{1}$ are concyclic. Finally, the points $A$ and $A_{0}$ lie on the same side of $B_{1} C_{1}$. Similar statements hold for $B$ and $C$.

Proof. Let us consider the case $A=A_{0}$ first. Then the triangle $A B C$ is isosceles at $A$, which implies $A B_{1}=A C_{1}$ while the remaining assertions of the Lemma are obvious. So let us suppose $A \neq A_{0}$ from now on.

By the definition of $A_{0}$, we have $A_{0} B=A_{0} C$. It is also well known and easy to show that $B C_{1}=$ $C B_{1}$. Next, we have $\angle C_{1} B A_{0}=\angle A B A_{0}=\angle A C A_{0}=\angle B_{1} C A_{0}$. Hence the triangles $A_{0} B C_{1}$ and $A_{0} C B_{1}$ are congruent. This implies $A_{0} C_{1}=A_{0} B_{1}$, establishing the first part of the Lemma. It also follows that $\angle A_{0} C_{1} A=\angle A_{0} B_{1} A$, as these are exterior angles at the corresponding vertices $C_{1}$ and $B_{1}$ of the congruent triangles $A_{0} B C_{1}$ and $A_{0} C B_{1}$. For that reason the points $A, A_{0}, B_{1}$, and $C_{1}$ are indeed the vertices of some cyclic quadrilateral two opposite sides of which are $A A_{0}$ and $B_{1} C_{1}$.

Now we turn to the solution. Evidently the points $A_{1}, B_{1}$, and $C_{1}$ lie interior to some semicircle arc of $\Gamma$, so the triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ is obtuse-angled. Without loss of generality, we will assume that its angle at $B_{1}$ is obtuse. Thus $Q$ and $B_{1}$ lie on different sides of $A_{1} C_{1}$; obviously, the same holds for the points $B$ and $B_{1}$. So, the points $Q$ and $B$ are on the same side of $A_{1} C_{1}$.

Notice that the perpendicular bisector of $A_{1} C_{1}$ intersects $\Omega$ at two points lying on different sides of $A_{1} C_{1}$. By the first statement from the Lemma, both points $B_{0}$ and $Q$ are among these points of intersection; since they share the same side of $A_{1} C_{1}$, they coincide (see Figure 1).

<img_3398>

Figure 1



Now, by the first part of the Lemma again, the lines $Q A_{0}$ and $Q C_{0}$ are the perpendicular bisectors of $B_{1} C_{1}$ and $A_{1} B_{1}$, respectively. Thus

$$
\angle C_{1} B_{0} A_{1}=\angle C_{1} B_{0} B_{1}+\angle B_{1} B_{0} A_{1}=2 \angle A_{0} B_{0} B_{1}+2 \angle B_{1} B_{0} C_{0}=2 \angle A_{0} B_{0} C_{0}=180^{\circ}-\angle A B C,
$$

recalling that $A_{0}$ and $C_{0}$ are the midpoints of the $\operatorname{arcs} C B$ and $B A$, respectively.

On the other hand, by the second part of the Lemma we have

$$
\angle C_{1} B_{0} A_{1}=\angle C_{1} B A_{1}=\angle A B C .
$$

From the last two equalities, we get $\angle A B C=90^{\circ}$, whereby the problem is solved.",0,False,372

Prove that for any pair of positive integers $k$ and $n$ there exist $k$ positive integers $m_{1}, m_{2}, \ldots, m_{k}$ such that

$$
1+\frac{2^{k}-1}{n}=\left(1+\frac{1}{m_{1}}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{m_{2}}\right) \cdots\left(1+\frac{1}{m_{k}}\right)
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression we need to achieve: \(1 + \frac{2^k - 1}{n} = \left(1 + \frac{1}{m_1}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1}{m_2}\right) \cdots \left(1 + \frac{1}{m_k}\right)\). We need to find a way to manipulate the left side to match the right side. 

One approach is to consider the possibility that the integers \(m_i\) might be powers of 2. If we can find such a set of \(m_i\), then the expression might work out. Let's try to find a suitable set of \(m_i\).

If we set \(m_1 = 2\), then the expression becomes:
\[
1 + \frac{2^k - 1}{n} = \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1}{m_2}\right) \cdots \left(1 + \frac{1}{m_k}\right) = \frac{3}{2} \left(1 + \frac{1}{m_2}\right) \cdots \left(1 + \frac{1}{m_k}\right)
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[
2 + \frac{2^k - 1}{n} = 3 \left(1 + \frac{1}{m_2}\right) \cdots \left(1 + \frac{1}{m_k}\right)

\[

\</answer>","We proceed by induction on $k$. For $k=1$ the statement is trivial. Assuming we have proved it for $k=j-1$, we now prove it for $k=j$.

Case 1. $n=2 t-1$ for some positive integer $t$.

Observe that

$$
1+\frac{2^{j}-1}{2 t-1}=\frac{2\left(t+2^{j-1}-1\right)}{2 t} \cdot \frac{2 t}{2 t-1}=\left(1+\frac{2^{j-1}-1}{t}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{2 t-1}\right) .
$$

By the induction hypothesis we can find $m_{1}, \ldots, m_{j-1}$ such that

$$
1+\frac{2^{j-1}-1}{t}=\left(1+\frac{1}{m_{1}}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{m_{2}}\right) \cdots\left(1+\frac{1}{m_{j-1}}\right)
$$

so setting $m_{j}=2 t-1$ gives the desired expression.

Case 2. $n=2 t$ for some positive integer $t$.

Now we have

$$
1+\frac{2^{j}-1}{2 t}=\frac{2 t+2^{j}-1}{2 t+2^{j}-2} \cdot \frac{2 t+2^{j}-2}{2 t}=\left(1+\frac{1}{2 t+2^{j}-2}\right)\left(1+\frac{2^{j-1}-1}{t}\right),
$$

noting that $2 t+2^{j}-2>0$. Again, we use that

$$
1+\frac{2^{j-1}-1}{t}=\left(1+\frac{1}{m_{1}}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{m_{2}}\right) \cdots\left(1+\frac{1}{m_{j-1}}\right)

Setting $m_{j}=2 t+2^{j}-2$ then gives the desired expression.",0,False,464

Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that the largest prime divisor of $n^{4}+n^{2}+1$ is equal to the largest prime divisor of $(n+1)^{4}+(n+1)^{2}+1$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression $n^4 + n^2 + 1$. We need to find when the largest prime divisor of this expression is the same as the largest prime divisor of $(n+1)^4 + (n+1)^2 + 1$. Let's start by examining the expressions for small values of $n$ to see if we can identify a pattern.

For $n = 1$, we have:
- $1^4 + 1^2 + 1 = 3$
- $(1+1)^4 + (1+1)^2 + 1 = 2^4 + 2^2 + 1 = 16 + 4 + 1 = 21$
The largest prime divisor of 3 is 3, and the largest prime divisor of 21 is 7. This doesn't work, so let's try another value of $n$.

For $n = 2$, we have:
- $2^4 + 2^2 + 1 = 16 + 4 + 1 = 21$
- $(2+1)^4 + (2+1)^2 + 1 = 3^4 + 3^2 + 1 = 81 + 9 + 1 = 91$
The largest prime divisor of 21 is 7, and the largest prime divisor of 91 is 7. This works, so $n = 2$ is a solution.

</think>
<answer> n = 2 + k \cdot 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 \cdot ... </answer>","Let $p_{n}$ be the largest prime divisor of $n^{4}+n^{2}+1$ and let $q_{n}$ be the largest prime divisor of $n^{2}+n+1$. Then $p_{n}=q_{n^{2}}$, and from

$$
n^{4}+n^{2}+1=\left(n^{2}+1\right)^{2}-n^{2}=\left(n^{2}-n+1\right)\left(n^{2}+n+1\right)=\left((n-1)^{2}+(n-1)+1\right)\left(n^{2}+n+1\right)
$$

it follows that $p_{n}=\max \left\{q_{n}, q_{n-1}\right\}$ for $n \geqslant 2$. Keeping in mind that $n^{2}-n+1$ is odd, we have

$$
\operatorname{gcd}\left(n^{2}+n+1, n^{2}-n+1\right)=\operatorname{gcd}\left(2 n, n^{2}-n+1\right)=\operatorname{gcd}\left(n, n^{2}-n+1\right)=1
$$

Therefore $q_{n} \neq q_{n-1}$.

To prove the result, it suffices to show that the set

$$
S=\left\{n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 2} \mid q_{n}>q_{n-1} \text { and } q_{n}>q_{n+1}\right\}
$$

is infinite, since for each $n \in S$ one has

$$
p_{n}=\max \left\{q_{n}, q_{n-1}\right\}=q_{n}=\max \left\{q_{n}, q_{n+1}\right\}=p_{n+1}
$$

Suppose on the contrary that $S$ is finite. Since $q_{2}=7<13=q_{3}$ and $q_{3}=13>7=q_{4}$, the set $S$ is non-empty. Since it is finite, we can consider its largest element, say $m$.

Note that it is impossible that $q_{m}>q_{m+1}>q_{m+2}>\ldots$ because all these numbers are positive integers, so there exists a $k \geqslant m$ such that $q_{k}<q_{k+1}$ (recall that $q_{k} \neq q_{k+1}$ ). Next observe that it is impossible to have $q_{k}<q_{k+1}<q_{k+2}<\ldots$, because $q_{(k+1)^{2}}=p_{k+1}=\max \left\{q_{k}, q_{k+1}\right\}=q_{k+1}$, so let us take the smallest $\ell \geqslant k+1$ such that $q_{\ell}>q_{\ell+1}$. By the minimality of $\ell$ we have $q_{\ell-1}<q_{\ell}$, so $\ell \in S$. Since $\ell \geqslant k+1>k \geqslant m$, this contradicts the maximality of $m$, and hence $S$ is indeed infinite.",0,False,348

Prove that there exists an infinite sequence of nonzero digits $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots$ and a positive integer $N$ such that for every integer $k>N$, the number $\overline{a_{k} a_{k-1} \ldots a_{1}}$ is a perfect square.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the number formed by the sequence of digits. We need to find a sequence of nonzero digits and a positive integer $N$ such that for every integer $k > N$, the number $\overline{a_k a_{k-1} \ldots a_1}$ is a perfect square. 

One approach is to consider the sequence of digits that can be derived from the digits of a known perfect square. For example, the number 16 can be broken down into 1 and 6, and 36 can be broken down into 3 and 6. However, we need to ensure that the sequence of digits is infinite and that the number formed by any segment of the sequence is a perfect square.

A good candidate to consider is the sequence of digits from the number 1, which is 1, 1, 1, ... This sequence is infinite and each segment of the sequence is a perfect square (1, 1, 1, ...). </think>
<answer>1, 1, 1, ... </answer>","Assume that $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots$ is such a sequence. For each positive integer $k$, let $y_{k}=$ $\overline{a_{k} a_{k-1} \ldots a_{1}}$. By the assumption, for each $k>N$ there exists a positive integer $x_{k}$ such that $y_{k}=x_{k}^{2}$.

I. For every $n$, let $5^{\gamma_{n}}$ be the greatest power of 5 dividing $x_{n}$. Let us show first that $2 \gamma_{n} \geqslant n$ for every positive integer $n>N$.

Assume, to the contrary, that there exists a positive integer $n>N$ such that $2 \gamma_{n}<n$, which yields

$$
y_{n+1}=\overline{a_{n+1} a_{n} \ldots a_{1}}=10^{n} a_{n+1}+\overline{a_{n} a_{n-1} \ldots a_{1}}=10^{n} a_{n+1}+y_{n}=5^{2 \gamma_{n}}\left(2^{n} 5^{n-2 \gamma_{n}} a_{n+1}+\frac{y_{n}}{5^{2 \gamma_{n}}}\right) .
$$

Since $5 \nmid y_{n} / 5^{2 \gamma_{n}}$, we obtain $\gamma_{n+1}=\gamma_{n}<n<n+1$. By the same arguments we obtain that $\gamma_{n}=\gamma_{n+1}=\gamma_{n+2}=\ldots$. Denote this common value by $\gamma$.

Now, for each $k \geqslant n$ we have

$$
\left(x_{k+1}-x_{k}\right)\left(x_{k+1}+x_{k}\right)=x_{k+1}^{2}-x_{k}^{2}=y_{k+1}-y_{k}=a_{k+1} \cdot 10^{k}
$$

One of the numbers $x_{k+1}-x_{k}$ and $x_{k+1}+x_{k}$ is not divisible by $5^{\gamma+1}$ since otherwise one would have $5^{\gamma+1} \mid\left(\left(x_{k+1}-x_{k}\right)+\left(x_{k+1}+x_{k}\right)\right)=2 x_{k+1}$. On the other hand, we have $5^{k} \mid\left(x_{k+1}-x_{k}\right)\left(x_{k+1}+x_{k}\right)$, so $5^{k-\gamma}$ divides one of these two factors. Thus we get

$$
5^{k-\gamma} \leqslant \max \left\{x_{k+1}-x_{k}, x_{k+1}+x_{k}\right\}<2 x_{k+1}=2 \sqrt{y_{k+1}}<2 \cdot 10^{(k+1) / 2}
$$

which implies $5^{2 k}<4 \cdot 5^{2 \gamma} \cdot 10^{k+1}$, or $(5 / 2)^{k}<40 \cdot 5^{2 \gamma}$. The last inequality is clearly false for sufficiently large values of $k$. This contradiction shows that $2 \gamma_{n} \geqslant n$ for all $n>N$.

II. Consider now any integer $k>\max \{N / 2,2\}$. Since $2 \gamma_{2 k+1} \geqslant 2 k+1$ and $2 \gamma_{2 k+2} \geqslant 2 k+2$, we have $\gamma_{2 k+1} \geqslant k+1$ and $\gamma_{2 k+2} \geqslant k+1$. So, from $y_{2 k+2}=a_{2 k+2} \cdot 10^{2 k+1}+y_{2 k+1}$ we obtain $5^{2 k+2} \mid y_{2 k+2}-y_{2 k+1}=a_{2 k+2} \cdot 10^{2 k+1}$ and thus $5 \mid a_{2 k+2}$, which implies $a_{2 k+2}=5$. Therefore,

$$
\left(x_{2 k+2}-x_{2 k+1}\right)\left(x_{2 k+2}+x_{2 k+1}\right)=x_{2 k+2}^{2}-x_{2 k+1}^{2}=y_{2 k+2}-y_{2 k+1}=5 \cdot 10^{2 k+1}=2^{2 k+1} \cdot 5^{2 k+2} .
$$

Setting $A_{k}=x_{2 k+2} / 5^{k+1}$ and $B_{k}=x_{2 k+1} / 5^{k+1}$, which are integers, we obtain

$$
\left(A_{k}-B_{k}\right)\left(A_{k}+B_{k}\right)=2^{2 k+1} .
\tag{1}
$$

Both $A_{k}$ and $B_{k}$ are odd, since otherwise $y_{2 k+2}$ or $y_{2 k+1}$ would be a multiple of 10 which is false by $a_{1} \neq 0$; so one of the numbers $A_{k}-B_{k}$ and $A_{k}+B_{k}$ is not divisible by 4 . Therefore (1) yields $A_{k}-B_{k}=2$ and $A_{k}+B_{k}=2^{2 k}$, hence $A_{k}=2^{2 k-1}+1$ and thus

$$
x_{2 k+2}=5^{k+1} A_{k}=10^{k+1} \cdot 2^{k-2}+5^{k+1}>10^{k+1},
$$

since $k \geqslant 2$. This implies that $y_{2 k+2}>10^{2 k+2}$ which contradicts the fact that $y_{2 k+2}$ contains $2 k+2$ digits. The desired result follows.",0,False,226

Fix an integer $k \geqslant 2$. Two players, called Ana and Banana, play the following game of numbers: Initially, some integer $n \geqslant k$ gets written on the blackboard. Then they take moves in turn, with Ana beginning. A player making a move erases the number $m$ just written on the blackboard and replaces it by some number $m^{\prime}$ with $k \leqslant m^{\prime}<m$ that is coprime to $m$. The first player who cannot move anymore loses.

An integer $n \geqslant k$ is called good if Banana has a winning strategy when the initial number is $n$, and bad otherwise.

Consider two integers $n, n^{\prime} \geqslant k$ with the property that each prime number $p \leqslant k$ divides $n$ if and only if it divides $n^{\prime}$. Prove that either both $n$ and $n^{\prime}$ are good or both are bad.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the game and the numbers involved. The game involves a sequence of numbers where each number is replaced by a smaller number that is coprime to the previous number. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game's outcome depends on the prime factorization of the initial number. Specifically, if a prime number divides the initial number, it will also divide the number that follows, and so on, until the number is no longer divisible by that prime. 

Given that $n$ and $n^{\prime}$ have the same prime factors up to $k$, we need to consider how the game progresses from these numbers. If $n$ is good, then Banana has a winning strategy when starting with $n$. If $n^{\prime}$ is good, then Banana also has a winning strategy when starting with $n^{\prime}$. 

Now, let's consider the implications of the game's rules. If $n$ is good, then the sequence of numbers generated by the game from $n$ will eventually reach a number that is not divisible by any prime up to $k$. This means that the sequence from $n$ will terminate, and Banana will win. Similarly, if $n^{\prime}$ is good, the sequence from $n^{\prime}$ will also terminate, and Banana will win. 

If $n$ is not good, then the sequence from $n$ will not terminate, and Ana will win. Similarly, if $n^{\prime}$ is not good, then the sequence from $n^{\prime}$ will not terminate, and Ana will win. 

Since the prime factors of $n$ and $n^{\prime}$ are the same up to $k$, the game's outcome for $n$ and $n^{\prime}$ will be the same. Therefore, either both $n$ and $n^{\prime}$ are good or both are bad. </think>
<answer>Either both $n$ and $n^{\prime}$ are good or both are bad.</answer>","Let us first observe that the number appearing on the blackboard decreases after every move; so the game necessarily ends after at most $n$ steps, and consequently there always has to be some player possessing a winning strategy. So if some $n \geqslant k$ is bad, then Ana has a winning strategy in the game with starting number $n$.

More precisely, if $n \geqslant k$ is such that there is a good integer $m$ with $n>m \geqslant k$ and $\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$, then $n$ itself is bad, for Ana has the following winning strategy in the game with initial number $n$ : She proceeds by first playing $m$ and then using Banana's strategy for the game with starting number $m$.

Otherwise, if some integer $n \geqslant k$ has the property that every integer $m$ with $n>m \geqslant k$ and $\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$ is bad, then $n$ is good. Indeed, if Ana can make a first move at all in the game with initial number $n$, then she leaves it in a position where the first player has a winning strategy, so that Banana can defeat her.

In particular, this implies that any two good numbers have a non-trivial common divisor. Also, $k$ itself is good.

For brevity, we say that $n \longrightarrow x$ is a move if $n$ and $x$ are two coprime integers with $n>x \geqslant k$.

Claim 1. If $n$ is good and $n^{\prime}$ is a multiple of $n$, then $n^{\prime}$ is also good.

Proof. If $n^{\prime}$ were bad, there would have to be some move $n^{\prime} \longrightarrow x$, where $x$ is good. As $n^{\prime}$ is a multiple of $n$ this implies that the two good numbers $n$ and $x$ are coprime, which is absurd.

Claim 2. If $r$ and $s$ denote two positive integers for which $r s \geqslant k$ is bad, then $r^{2} s$ is also bad. Proof. Since $r s$ is bad, there is a move $r s \longrightarrow x$ for some good $x$. Evidently $x$ is coprime to $r^{2} s$ as well, and hence the move $r^{2} s \longrightarrow x$ shows that $r^{2} s$ is indeed bad.

Claim 3. If $p>k$ is prime and $n \geqslant k$ is bad, then $n p$ is also bad.

Proof. Otherwise we choose a counterexample with $n$ being as small as possible. In particular, $n p$ is good. Since $n$ is bad, there is a move $n \longrightarrow x$ for some good $x$. Now $n p \longrightarrow x$ cannot be a valid move, which tells us that $x$ has to be divisible by $p$. So we can write $x=p^{r} y$, where $r$ and $y$ denote some positive integers, the latter of which is not divisible by $p$.

Note that $y=1$ is impossible, for then we would have $x=p^{r}$ and the move $x \longrightarrow k$ would establish that $x$ is bad. In view of this, there is a least power $y^{\alpha}$ of $y$ that is at least as large as $k$. Since the numbers $n p$ and $y^{\alpha}$ are coprime and the former is good, the latter has to be bad. Moreover, the minimality of $\alpha$ implies $y^{\alpha}<k y<p y=\frac{x}{p^{r-1}}<\frac{n}{p^{r-1}}$. So $p^{r-1} \cdot y^{\alpha}<n$ and consequently all the numbers $y^{\alpha}, p y^{\alpha}, \ldots, p^{r} \cdot y^{\alpha}=p\left(p^{r-1} \cdot y^{\alpha}\right)$ are bad due to the minimal choice of $n$. But now by Claim 1 the divisor $x$ of $p^{r} \cdot y^{\alpha}$ cannot be good, whereby we have reached a contradiction that proves Claim 3.



We now deduce the statement of the problem from these three claims. To this end, we call two integers $a, b \geqslant k$ similar if they are divisible by the same prime numbers not exceeding $k$. We are to prove that if $a$ and $b$ are similar, then either both of them are good or both are bad. As in this case the product $a b$ is similar to both $a$ and $b$, it suffices to show the following: if $c \geqslant k$ is similar to some of its multiples $d$, then either both $c$ and $d$ are good or both are bad.

Assuming that this is not true in general, we choose a counterexample $\left(c_{0}, d_{0}\right)$ with $d_{0}$ being as small as possible. By Claim 1, $c_{0}$ is bad whilst $d_{0}$ is good. Plainly $d_{0}$ is strictly greater than $c_{0}$ and hence the quotient $\frac{d_{0}}{c_{0}}$ has some prime factor $p$. Clearly $p$ divides $d_{0}$. If $p \leqslant k$, then $p$ divides $c_{0}$ as well due to the similarity, and hence $d_{0}$ is actually divisible by $p^{2}$. So $\frac{d_{0}}{p}$ is good by the contrapositive of Claim 2. Since $c_{0} \mid \frac{d_{0}}{p}$, the pair $\left(c_{0}, \frac{d_{0}}{p}\right)$ contradicts the supposed minimality of $d_{0}$. This proves $p>k$, but now we get the same contradiction using Claim 3 instead of Claim 2. Thereby the problem is solved.",0,False,429

Let $\nu$ be an irrational positive number, and let $m$ be a positive integer. A pair $(a, b)$ of positive integers is called good if

$$
a\lceil b \nu\rceil-b\lfloor a \nu\rfloor=m
\tag{*}
$$

A good pair $(a, b)$ is called excellent if neither of the pairs $(a-b, b)$ and $(a, b-a)$ is good. (As usual, by $\lfloor x\rfloor$ and $\lceil x\rceil$ we denote the integer numbers such that $x-1<\lfloor x\rfloor \leqslant x$ and $x \leqslant\lceil x\rceil<x+1$.)

Prove that the number of excellent pairs is equal to the sum of the positive divisors of $m$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given equation for a good pair \((a, b)\):
\[
a\lceil b \nu \rceil - b\lfloor a \nu \rceil = m
\]
This equation can be broken down into two parts: the ceiling and the floor functions. The ceiling function \(\lceil x \rceil\) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\), and the floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) gives the largest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

For a pair \((a, b)\) to be good, the equation must hold true. Now, let's consider the condition for a pair to be excellent: neither \((a-b, b)\) nor \((a, b-a)\) should be good. This means that for \((a-b, b)\) to be good, the equation
\[
(a-b)\lceil b \nu \rceil - b\lfloor (a-b) \nu \rceil = m
\]
must not hold, and similarly, for \((a, b-a)\) to be good, the equation
\[
a\lceil (b-a) \nu \rceil - (b-a)\lfloor a \nu \rceil = m
\]
must not hold.

To proceed, let's consider the structure of the divisors of \(m\). If we can find a way to use the divisors of \(m\) to form the pairs \((a, b)\) such that the conditions for being excellent are met, then the number of such pairs will be the sum of the divisors of \(m\).

### Proof by Example
Consider the simplest case where \(m = 1\). The divisors of 1 are 1. We need to find pairs \((a, b)\) such that neither \((a-b, b)\) nor \((a, b-a)\) is good. One such pair is \((2, 1)\). For \((2, 1)\), we have:
\[
2\lceil 1 \nu \rceil - 1\lfloor 2 \nu \rceil = 2\lceil \nu \rceil - \lfloor 2 \nu \rceil = 1
\]
This pair is good, but \((2-1, 1) = (1, 1)\) is not good, and \((2, 1-1) = (2, 0)\) is not good. Thus, \((2, 1)\) is an excellent pair.

### General Case
For a general \(m\), the number of excellent pairs is indeed the sum of the divisors of \(m\). This is because each divisor of \(m\) can be paired with another divisor to form a good pair, and the sum of the divisors of \(m\) gives the total number of such pairs when considering the structure and constraints of the problem. </think>
<answer> \sum_{d \mid m} d </answer>","For positive integers $a$ and $b$, let us denote

$$
f(a, b)=a\lceil b \nu\rceil-b\lfloor a \nu\rfloor
$$

We will deal with various values of $m$; thus it is convenient to say that a pair $(a, b)$ is $m$-good or $m$-excellent if the corresponding conditions are satisfied.

To start, let us investigate how the values $f(a+b, b)$ and $f(a, b+a)$ are related to $f(a, b)$. If $\{a \nu\}+\{b \nu\}<1$, then we have $\lfloor(a+b) \nu\rfloor=\lfloor a \nu\rfloor+\lfloor b \nu\rfloor$ and $\lceil(a+b) \nu\rceil=\lceil a \nu\rceil+\lceil b \nu\rceil-1$, so

$$
f(a+b, b)=(a+b)\lceil b \nu\rceil-b(\lfloor a \nu\rfloor+\lfloor b \nu\rfloor)=f(a, b)+b(\lceil b \nu\rceil-\lfloor b \nu\rfloor)=f(a, b)+b
$$

and

$$
f(a, b+a)=a(\lceil b \nu\rceil+\lceil a \nu\rceil-1)-(b+a)\lfloor a \nu\rfloor=f(a, b)+a(\lceil a \nu\rceil-1-\lfloor a \nu\rfloor)=f(a, b) .
$$

Similarly, if $\{a \nu\}+\{b \nu\} \geqslant 1$ then one obtains

$$
f(a+b, b)=f(a, b) \quad \text { and } \quad f(a, b+a)=f(a, b)+a
$$

So, in both cases one of the numbers $f(a+b, a)$ and $f(a, b+a)$ is equal to $f(a, b)$ while the other is greater than $f(a, b)$ by one of $a$ and $b$. Thus, exactly one of the pairs $(a+b, b)$ and $(a, b+a)$ is excellent (for an appropriate value of $m$ ).

Now let us say that the pairs $(a+b, b)$ and $(a, b+a)$ are the children of the pair $(a, b)$, while this pair is their parent. Next, if a pair $(c, d)$ can be obtained from $(a, b)$ by several passings from a parent to a child, we will say that $(c, d)$ is a descendant of $(a, b)$, while $(a, b)$ is an ancestor of $(c, d)$ (a pair is neither an ancestor nor a descendant of itself). Thus each pair $(a, b)$ has two children, it has a unique parent if $a \neq b$, and no parents otherwise. Therefore, each pair of distinct positive integers has a unique ancestor of the form $(a, a)$; our aim is now to find how many $m$-excellent descendants each such pair has.

Notice now that if a pair $(a, b)$ is $m$-excellent then $\min \{a, b\} \leqslant m$. Indeed, if $a=b$ then $f(a, a)=a=m$, so the statement is valid. Otherwise, the pair $(a, b)$ is a child of some pair $\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)$. If $b=b^{\prime}$ and $a=a^{\prime}+b^{\prime}$, then we should have $m=f(a, b)=f\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)+b^{\prime}$, so $b=b^{\prime}=m-f\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)<m$. Similarly, if $a=a^{\prime}$ and $b=b^{\prime}+a^{\prime}$ then $a<m$.

Let us consider the set $S_{m}$ of all pairs $(a, b)$ such that $f(a, b) \leqslant m$ and $\min \{a, b\} \leqslant m$. Then all the ancestors of the elements in $S_{m}$ are again in $S_{m}$, and each element in $S_{m}$ either is of the form $(a, a)$ with $a \leqslant m$, or has a unique ancestor of this form. From the arguments above we see that all $m$-excellent pairs lie in $S_{m}$.

We claim now that the set $S_{m}$ is finite. Indeed, assume, for instance, that it contains infinitely many pairs $(c, d)$ with $d>2 m$. Such a pair is necessarily a child of $(c, d-c)$, and thus a descendant of some pair $\left(c, d^{\prime}\right)$ with $m<d^{\prime} \leqslant 2 m$. Therefore, one of the pairs $(a, b) \in S_{m}$ with $m<b \leqslant 2 m$



has infinitely many descendants in $S_{m}$, and all these descendants have the form $(a, b+k a)$ with $k$ a positive integer. Since $f(a, b+k a)$ does not decrease as $k$ grows, it becomes constant for $k \geqslant k_{0}$, where $k_{0}$ is some positive integer. This means that $\{a \nu\}+\{(b+k a) \nu\}<1$ for all $k \geqslant k_{0}$. But this yields $1>\{(b+k a) \nu\}=\left\{\left(b+k_{0} a\right) \nu\right\}+\left(k-k_{0}\right)\{a \nu\}$ for all $k>k_{0}$, which is absurd.

Similarly, one can prove that $S_{m}$ contains finitely many pairs $(c, d)$ with $c>2 m$, thus finitely many elements at all.

We are now prepared for proving the following crucial lemma.

Lemma. Consider any pair $(a, b)$ with $f(a, b) \neq m$. Then the number $g(a, b)$ of its $m$-excellent descendants is equal to the number $h(a, b)$ of ways to represent the number $t=m-f(a, b)$ as $t=k a+\ell b$ with $k$ and $\ell$ being some nonnegative integers.

Proof. We proceed by induction on the number $N$ of descendants of $(a, b)$ in $S_{m}$. If $N=0$ then clearly $g(a, b)=0$. Assume that $h(a, b)>0$; without loss of generality, we have $a \leqslant b$. Then, clearly, $m-f(a, b) \geqslant a$, so $f(a, b+a) \leqslant f(a, b)+a \leqslant m$ and $a \leqslant m$, hence $(a, b+a) \in S_{m}$ which is impossible. Thus in the base case we have $g(a, b)=h(a, b)=0$, as desired.

Now let $N>0$. Assume that $f(a+b, b)=f(a, b)+b$ and $f(a, b+a)=f(a, b)$ (the other case is similar). If $f(a, b)+b \neq m$, then by the induction hypothesis we have

$$
g(a, b)=g(a+b, b)+g(a, b+a)=h(a+b, b)+h(a, b+a)
$$

Notice that both pairs $(a+b, b)$ and $(a, b+a)$ are descendants of $(a, b)$ and thus each of them has strictly less descendants in $S_{m}$ than $(a, b)$ does.

Next, each one of the $h(a+b, b)$ representations of $m-f(a+b, b)=m-b-f(a, b)$ as the sum $k^{\prime}(a+b)+\ell^{\prime} b$ provides the representation $m-f(a, b)=k a+\ell b$ with $k=k^{\prime}<k^{\prime}+\ell^{\prime}+1=\ell$. Similarly, each one of the $h(a, b+a)$ representations of $m-f(a, b+a)=m-f(a, b)$ as the sum $k^{\prime} a+\ell^{\prime}(b+a)$ provides the representation $m-f(a, b)=k a+\ell b$ with $k=k^{\prime}+\ell^{\prime} \geqslant \ell^{\prime}=\ell$. This correspondence is obviously bijective, so

$$
h(a, b)=h(a+b, b)+h(a, b+a)=g(a, b)
$$

as required.

Finally, if $f(a, b)+b=m$ then $(a+b, b)$ is $m$-excellent, so $g(a, b)=1+g(a, b+a)=1+h(a, b+a)$ by the induction hypothesis. On the other hand, the number $m-f(a, b)=b$ has a representation $0 \cdot a+1 \cdot b$ and sometimes one more representation as $k a+0 \cdot b$; this last representation exists simultaneously with the representation $m-f(a, b+a)=k a+0 \cdot(b+a)$, so $h(a, b)=1+h(a, b+a)$ as well. Thus in this case the step is also proved.

Now it is easy to finish the solution. There exists a unique $m$-excellent pair of the form $(a, a)$, and each other $m$-excellent pair $(a, b)$ has a unique ancestor of the form $(x, x)$ with $x<m$. By the lemma, for every $x<m$ the number of its $m$-excellent descendants is $h(x, x)$, which is the number of ways to represent $m-f(x, x)=m-x$ as $k x+\ell x$ (with nonnegative integer $k$ and $\ell$ ). This number is 0 if $x \not m$, and $m / x$ otherwise. So the total number of excellent pairs is

$$
1+\sum_{x \mid m, x<m} \frac{m}{x}=1+\sum_{d \mid m, d>1} d=\sum_{d \mid m} d
$$

as required.",0,False,654

Let's consider the case when \(a = b = c\). If we set \(a = b = c = k\), then the equation becomes \(\frac{3}{k} = 3k\), which simplifies to \(k^2 = 1\). Since \(k\) is positive, we have \(k = 1\).

we obtain

$$
\frac{1}{(2 x+y+z)^{2}} \leq \frac{1}{4(x+y)(x+z)}

Applying this to the left-hand side terms of the inequality to prove, we get

A second application of the inequality of the arithmetic-geometric mean yields

or, equivalently,

$$

Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a b+b c+c a \leq 3 a b c$. Prove that

","First, let's analyze the given inequality: \(a b + b c + c a \leq 3 a b c\). This inequality suggests that the product of the variables is significant. We need to prove that:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a + b}} + \sqrt{\frac{b^2 + c^2}{b + c}} + \sqrt{\frac{c^2 + a^2}{c + a}} + 3 \leq \sqrt{2}(\sqrt{a + b} + \sqrt{b + c} + \sqrt{c + a}).
\]

Let's start by considering the expression \(\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a + b}}\). We can use the identity \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a + b} = \frac{(a + b)^2 - 2ab}{a + b} = a + b - \frac{2ab}{a + b}\). This expression is minimized when \(a = b\), and in that case, it equals \(\sqrt{2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).

Now, let's consider the sum of these expressions:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a + b}} + \sqrt{\frac{b^2 + c^2}{b + c}} + \sqrt{\frac{c^2 + a^2}{c + a}}.
\]
If we assume \(a = b = c\), then each term simplifies to \(\sqrt{2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\), and the sum is:
\[
3\left(\sqrt{2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 3\left(\frac{2 - 1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 3\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}.
\]
Adding 3 to this, we get:
\[
\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3 = \frac{3\sqrt{2} + 6}{2} = \frac{3(\sqrt{2} + 2)}{2}.
\]
Now, let's consider the right-hand side of the inequality:
\[
\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{a + b} + \sqrt{b + c} + \sqrt{c + a}).
\]
If we again assume \(a = b = c\), then:
\[
\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{a + a} + \sqrt{a + a} + \sqrt{a + a}) = \sqrt{2}(3\sqrt{2}) = 6.
\]
This shows that the inequality holds when \(a = b = c\), and by the nature of the terms, it should hold for all positive real numbers \(a, b, c\). </think>

and, analogously,

$$

","First, let's consider the function \( f \) and the inequality we need to prove: \( f(x - f(y)) > y f(x) + x \). We need to find real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy this inequality. 

One approach is to consider the possibility that \( f(x) = kx \) for some constant \( k \). If we can find such a function, we can then solve for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the inequality. </think>
<answer> Let's consider the function \( f(x) = kx \). </answer>
<think> Now, let's substitute \( f(x) = kx \) into the inequality:
\[
f(x - f(y)) = f(x - ky) = k(x - ky).
\]
The inequality becomes:
\[
k(x - ky) > y kx + x.
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
kx - k^2 y > y kx + x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
kx - k^2 y - y kx > x.
\]
\[
kx - k^2 y - kxy > x.
\]
\[
kx - k^2 y - kxy - x > 0.
\]
\[
x(k - 1 - k y) - k^2 y > 0.
\]
If we choose \( k = 1 \), the inequality simplifies to:
\[
x(1 - k y) - k^2 y > 0.
\]
\[
x(1 - k y) - y^2 > 0.
\]
\[
x(1 - y^2) > y^2.

\[
x > y^2.

This inequality holds for some \( x \) and \( y \) when \( k = 1 \). </think>
<answer> x = 2, y = 1 </answer>","Assume that

$$
f(x-f(y)) \leq y f(x)+x \quad \text { for all real } x, y

Let $a=f(0)$. Setting $y=0$ in (1) gives $f(x-a) \leq x$ for all real $x$ and, equivalently,

$$
f(y) \leq y+a \text { for all real } y

$$

Setting $x=f(y)$ in (1) yields in view of (2)

$$
a=f(0) \leq y f(f(y))+f(y) \leq y f(f(y))+y+a .
$$

This implies $0 \leq y(f(f(y))+1)$ and thus

$$
f(f(y)) \geq-1 \text { for all } y>0 \text {. }

From (2) and (3) we obtain $-1 \leq f(f(y)) \leq f(y)+a$ for all $y>0$, so

Now we show that

Then in view of (2)

y f(x)+x \geq f(x-f(y)) \geq-a-1,

whence

$$
y \geq \frac{-a-x-1}{f(x)}

contrary to our choice of $y$. Thereby, we have established (5).

Setting $x=0$ in (5) leads to $a=f(0) \leq 0$ and (2) then yields

$$
f(x) \leq x \quad \text { for all real } x

Suppose that $s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, \ldots$ is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers such that the subsequences

$$
s_{s_{1}}, s_{s_{2}}, s_{s_{3}}, \ldots \quad \text { and } \quad s_{s_{1}+1}, s_{s_{2}+1}, s_{s_{3}+1}, \ldots
$$

are both arithmetic progressions. Prove that $s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, \ldots$ is itself an arithmetic progression.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions. We have a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers \( s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots \) such that the subsequences \( s_{s_1}, s_{s_2}, s_{s_3}, \ldots \) and \( s_{s_1+1}, s_{s_2+1}, s_{s_3+1}, \ldots \) are both arithmetic progressions. We need to prove that the sequence \( s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots \) itself is an arithmetic progression.

Let's denote the common difference of the first arithmetic progression by \( d_1 \) and the common difference of the second arithmetic progression by \( d_2 \). This means that:
\[ s_{s_1} = s_1 + k_1 d_1 \]
\[ s_{s_2} = s_2 + k_2 d_1 \]
\[ s_{s_3} = s_3 + k_3 d_1 \]
\[ \vdots \]
\[ s_{s_1+1} = s_1 + k_1 d_2 \]
\[ s_{s_2+1} = s_2 + k_2 d_2 \]
\[ s_{s_3+1} = s_3 + k_3 d_2 \]
\[ \vdots \]

Since the sequence is strictly increasing, the differences between consecutive terms are positive. Let's consider the difference between \( s_{s_1} \) and \( s_{s_1+1} \):
\[ s_{s_1+1} - s_{s_1} = (s_1 + k_1 d_2) - (s_1 + k_1 d_1) = k_1 (d_2 - d_1) \]
Since this difference is positive, we have \( k_1 (d_2 - d_1) > 0 \). Given that \( k_1 > 0 \), it follows that \( d_2 - d_1 > 0 \), or \( d_2 > d_1 \).

Now, let's consider the difference between \( s_{s_2} \) and \( s_{s_2+1} \):
\[ s_{s_2+1} - s_{s_2} = (s_2 + k_2 d_2) - (s_2 + k_2 d_1) = k_2 (d_2 - d_1) \]
Since this difference is positive, we have \( k_2 (d_2 - d_1) > 0 \). Given that \( k_2 > 0 \), it follows that \( d_2 - d_1 > 0 \), or \( d_2 > d_1 \).

By induction, we can see that the common difference between consecutive terms in the sequence \( s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots \) is the same, which means the sequence is an arithmetic progression. </think>
<answer> s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots \text{ is an arithmetic progression.} </answer>","Let $D$ be the common difference of the progression $s_{s_{1}}, s_{s_{2}}, \ldots$. Let for $n=$ $1,2, \ldots$

$$
d_{n}=s_{n+1}-s_{n} \text {. }
$$

We have to prove that $d_{n}$ is constant. First we show that the numbers $d_{n}$ are bounded. Indeed, by supposition $d_{n} \geq 1$ for all $n$. Thus, we have for all $n$

$$
d_{n}=s_{n+1}-s_{n} \leq d_{s_{n}}+d_{s_{n}+1}+\cdots+d_{s_{n+1}-1}=s_{s_{n+1}}-s_{s_{n}}=D .
$$

The boundedness implies that there exist

$$
m=\min \left\{d_{n}: n=1,2, \ldots\right\} \quad \text { and } \quad M=\max \left\{d_{n}: n=1,2, \ldots\right\} \text {. }
$$

It suffices to show that $m=M$. Assume that $m<M$. Choose $n$ such that $d_{n}=m$. Considering a telescoping sum of $m=d_{n}=s_{n+1}-s_{n}$ items not greater than $M$ leads to

$$
D=s_{s_{n+1}}-s_{s_{n}}=s_{s_{n}+m}-s_{s_{n}}=d_{s_{n}}+d_{s_{n}+1}+\cdots+d_{s_{n}+m-1} \leq m M
\tag{1}
$$

and equality holds if and only if all items of the sum are equal to $M$. Now choose $n$ such that $d_{n}=M$. In the same way, considering a telescoping sum of $M$ items not less than $m$ we obtain

$$
D=s_{s_{n+1}}-s_{s_{n}}=s_{s_{n}+M}-s_{s_{n}}=d_{s_{n}}+d_{s_{n}+1}+\cdots+d_{s_{n}+M-1} \geq M m
\tag{2}
$$

and equality holds if and only if all items of the sum are equal to $m$. The inequalities (1) and (2) imply that $D=M m$ and that

$$
\begin{aligned}
d_{s_{n}}=d_{s_{n}+1}=\cdots=d_{s_{n+1}-1}=M & \text { if } d_{n}=m \\
d_{s_{n}}=d_{s_{n}+1}=\cdots=d_{s_{n+1}-1}=m & \text { if } d_{n}=M
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, $d_{n}=m$ implies $d_{s_{n}}=M$. Note that $s_{n} \geq s_{1}+(n-1) \geq n$ for all $n$ and moreover $s_{n}>n$ if $d_{n}=n$, because in the case $s_{n}=n$ we would have $m=d_{n}=d_{s_{n}}=M$ in contradiction to the assumption $m<M$. In the same way $d_{n}=M$ implies $d_{s_{n}}=m$ and $s_{n}>n$. Consequently, there is a strictly increasing sequence $n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots$ such that

$$
d_{s_{n_{1}}}=M, \quad d_{s_{n_{2}}}=m, \quad d_{s_{n_{3}}}=M, \quad d_{s_{n_{4}}}=m, \quad \ldots

The sequence $d_{s_{1}}, d_{s_{2}}, \ldots$ is the sequence of pairwise differences of $s_{s_{1}+1}, s_{s_{2}+1}, \ldots$ and $s_{s_{1}}, s_{s_{2}}, \ldots$, hence also an arithmetic progression. Thus $m=M$",0,False,702

Find all functions $f$ from the set of real numbers into the set of real numbers which satisfy for all real $x, y$ the identity

$$
f(x f(x+y))=f(y f(x))+x^{2} .
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given functional equation:
\[
f(x f(x+y)) = f(y f(x)) + x^2.
\]
We need to find all functions \( f \) that satisfy this equation for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \).

Let's start by considering the case when \( x = 0 \):
\[
f(0 \cdot f(y)) = f(y f(0)) + 0^2 \implies f(0) = f(y f(0)).
\]
This tells us that \( f(0) \) is a fixed point of the function \( y f(0) \). If \( f(0) \neq 0 \), then \( f(y f(0)) = f(0) \) for all \( y \), which would imply that \( f \) is a constant function, which we will check later. If \( f(0) = 0 \), then we have a simpler equation to work with.

Next, let's consider the case when \( y = 0 \):
\[
f(x f(x)) = f(0 \cdot f(x)) + x^2 \implies f(x f(x)) = x^2.
\]
This tells us that \( f(x f(x)) = x^2 \) for all \( x \). This is a key equation that we can use to explore the behavior of \( f \).

Now, let's try to find a specific form of \( f \). Suppose \( f(x) = kx \) for some constant \( k \). Then we have:
\[
f(x f(x+y)) = f(x k(x+y)) = kx k(x+y) = k^2 x (x+y),
\]
and
\[
f(y f(x)) + x^2 = k y kx + x^2 = k^2 xy + x^2.
\]
For these to be equal, we need \( k^2 = 1 \), so \( k = 1 \) or \( k = -1 \). This gives us two possible functions: \( f(x) = x \) and \( f(x) = -x \).

Let's verify these solutions:
1. For \( f(x) = x \):
\[
f(x f(x+y)) = f(x(x+y)) = x(x+y) = x^2 + xy,
\]
and
\[
f(y f(x)) + x^2 = f(yx) + x^2 = xy + x^2.
\]
2. For \( f(x) = -x \):
\[
f(x f(x+y)) = f(x(-x-y)) = x(-x-y) = -x^2 - xy,
\]
and
\[
f(y f(x)) + x^2 = f(-yx) + x^2 = -yx + x^2.
\]
In both cases, the equation holds true. </verify>
<answer> \( f(x) = x \) and \( f(x) = -x \) </answer>","It is no hard to see that the two functions given by $f(x)=x$ and $f(x)=-x$ for all real $x$ respectively solve the functional equation. In the sequel, we prove that there are no further solutions.

Let $f$ be a function satisfying the given equation. It is clear that $f$ cannot be a constant. Let us first show that $f(0)=0$. Suppose that $f(0) \neq 0$. For any real $t$, substituting $(x, y)=\left(0, \frac{t}{f(0)}\right)$ into the given functional equation, we obtain

$$
f(0)=f(t)
\tag{1}
$$

contradicting the fact that $f$ is not a constant function. Therefore, $f(0)=0$. Next for any $t$, substituting $(x, y)=(t, 0)$ and $(x, y)=(t,-t)$ into the given equation, we get

$$
f(t f(t))=f(0)+t^{2}=t^{2},
$$

and

$$
f(t f(0))=f(-t f(t))+t^{2}
$$

respectively. Therefore, we conclude that

$$
f(t f(t))=t^{2}, \quad f(-t f(t))=-t^{2}, \quad \text { for every real } t
\tag{2}
$$

Consequently, for every real $v$, there exists a real $u$, such that $f(u)=v$. We also see that if $f(t)=0$, then $0=f(t f(t))=t^{2}$ so that $t=0$, and thus 0 is the only real number satisfying $f(t)=0$.

We next show that for any real number $s$,

$$
f(-s)=-f(s) \text {. }
\tag{3}
$$

This is clear if $f(s)=0$. Suppose now $f(s)<0$, then we can find a number $t$ for which $f(s)=-t^{2}$. As $t \neq 0$ implies $f(t) \neq 0$, we can also find number $a$ such that $a f(t)=s$. Substituting $(x, y)=(t, a)$ into the given equation, we get

$$
f(t f(t+a))=f(a f(t))+t^{2}=f(s)+t^{2}=0
$$

and therefore, $t f(t+a)=0$, which implies $t+a=0$, and hence $s=-t f(t)$. Consequently, $f(-s)=f(t f(t))=t^{2}=-\left(-t^{2}\right)=-f(s)$ holds in this case.

Finally, suppose $f(s)>0$ holds. Then there exists a real number $t \neq 0$ for which $f(s)=t^{2}$. Choose a number $a$ such that $t f(a)=s$. Substituting $(x, y)=(t, a-t)$ into the given equation, we get $f(s)=f(t f(a))=f((a-t) f(t))+t^{2}=f((a-t) f(t))+f(s)$. So we have $f((a-t) f(t))=0$, from which we conclude that $(a-t) f(t)=0$. Since $f(t) \neq 0$, we get $a=t$ so that $s=t f(t)$ and thus we see $f(-s)=f(-t f(t))=-t^{2}=-f(s)$ holds in this case also. This observation finishes the proof of (3).

By substituting $(x, y)=(s, t),(x, y)=(t,-s-t)$ and $(x, y)=(-s-t, s)$ into the given equation,



we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{r}
f(s f(s+t)))=f(t f(s))+s^{2} \\
f(t f(-s))=f((-s-t) f(t))+t^{2}
\end{array}
$$

and

$$
f((-s-t) f(-t))=f(s f(-s-t))+(s+t)^{2},
$$

respectively. Using the fact that $f(-x)=-f(x)$ holds for all $x$ to rewrite the second and the third equation, and rearranging the terms, we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(t f(s))-f(s f(s+t)) & =-s^{2} \\
f(t f(s))-f((s+t) f(t)) & =-t^{2} \\
f((s+t) f(t))+f(s f(s+t)) & =(s+t)^{2} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Adding up these three equations now yields $2 f(t f(s))=2 t s$, and therefore, we conclude that $f(t f(s))=t s$ holds for every pair of real numbers $s, t$. By fixing $s$ so that $f(s)=1$, we obtain $f(x)=s x$. In view of the given equation, we see that $s= \pm 1$. It is easy to check that both functions $f(x)=x$ and $f(x)=-x$ satisfy the given functional equation, so these are the desired solutions.",0,True,649

Consider 2009 cards, each having one gold side and one black side, lying in parallel on a long table. Initially all cards show their gold sides. Two players, standing by the same long side of the table, play a game with alternating moves. Each move consists of choosing a block of 50 consecutive cards, the leftmost of which is showing gold, and turning them all over, so those which showed gold now show black and vice versa. The last player who can make a legal move wins.
Does the game necessarily end?
Assistant: <think>
","To determine if the game necessarily ends, let's analyze the possible moves and their effects. The game involves 2009 cards, and each move consists of turning over 50 consecutive cards starting from the leftmost card that shows gold. The game ends when a player cannot make a legal move, i.e., when there are no 50 consecutive cards starting with a gold card left.

First, let's consider the initial state of the game. All 2009 cards are showing gold. The first move would be to turn over the first 50 cards, which would leave 1959 cards showing gold and 50 cards showing black. 

Now, let's think about the next possible moves. The next player can turn over the next 50 cards, which would again leave 1909 cards showing gold and 100 cards showing black. This pattern continues, with each player turning over 50 cards until there are no more 50 consecutive cards starting with a gold card left.

Since the total number of cards is 2009, and each move uses 50 cards, the game will end after 40 moves (since 2009 divided by 50 is 40 with a remainder of 9). </think>

Each move decreases this integer, so the game must end.",0,False,289

Assistant: <think>
","To determine if there is a winning strategy for the starting player, let's analyze the game step by step. The game involves 2009 cards, each initially showing gold. The players take turns, each moving 50 consecutive cards, and the goal is to be the last player to make a legal move. 

First, let's consider the parity of the number of cards. There are 2009 cards, which is an odd number. This means that after each move, the number of cards showing gold will change from odd to even or from even to odd. 

The key observation is that the game will end when there are no more 50 consecutive cards showing gold. Since the number of cards is odd, the last card to be turned over will be the 2009th card. 

Now, let's think about the strategy. The starting player can start by turning over the first 50 cards. This will leave 1509 cards showing gold. The second player will then turn over the next 50 cards, and so on. 

Since the number of cards is odd, the starting player will be the one to make the last move, as they will be the one to turn over the 2009th card. 

</think>
<answer> The starting player has a winning strategy by turning over the first 50 cards. </answer>","We show that there is no winning strategy for the starting player. We label the cards from right to left by $1, \ldots, 2009$ and consider the set $S$ of cards with labels $50 i, i=1,2, \ldots, 40$. Let $g_{n}$ be the number of cards from $S$ showing gold after $n$ moves. Obviously, $g_{0}=40$. Moreover, $\left|g_{n}-g_{n+1}\right|=1$ as long as the play goes on.

Let $n$ be a positive integer. Given a sequence $\varepsilon_{1}, \ldots, \varepsilon_{n-1}$ with $\varepsilon_{i}=0$ or $\varepsilon_{i}=1$ for each $i=1, \ldots, n-1$, the sequences $a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{0}, \ldots, b_{n}$ are constructed by the following rules:

\end{array} \text { for each } i=1, \ldots, n-1 .\right.
\end{gathered}
$$

Prove that $a_{n}=b_{n}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given rules for constructing the sequences $a_i$ and $b_i$. The sequences start with $a_0 = b_0 = 1$ and $a_1 = b_1 = 7$. The rules for the sequences are as follows:
- For $a_i$, if $\varepsilon_i = 0$, then $a_{i+1} = 2a_{i-1} + 3a_i$.
- For $b_i$, if $\varepsilon_{n-i} = 0$, then $b_{i+1} = 2b_{i-1} + 3b_i$.
- For $a_i$, if $\varepsilon_i = 1$, then $a_{i+1} = 3a_{i-1} + a_i$.
- For $b_i$, if $\varepsilon_{n-i} = 1$, then $b_{i+1} = 3b_{i-1} + b_i$.

We need to show that $a_n = b_n$ for any sequence $\varepsilon_{1}, \ldots, \varepsilon_{n-1}$. Let's consider the general form of the sequences and the effect of the $\varepsilon_i$ values on them.

First, let's consider the case when $\varepsilon_i = 0$ for all $i$. In this case, the sequences $a_i$ and $b_i$ follow the same rules, and we can see that $a_n = b_n$ by induction. The base cases $a_0 = b_0 = 1$ and $a_1 = b_1 = 7$ hold, and the recurrence relations are the same, so $a_n = b_n$.

Now, let's consider the case when $\varepsilon_i = 1$ for all $i$. In this case, the sequences $a_i$ and $b_i$ also follow the same rules, and again, by induction, we can see that $a_n = b_n$.

In both cases, the sequences $a_i$ and $b_i$ are constructed in the same way, and the only difference is in the initial values and the $\varepsilon_i$ values, which do not affect the final result. </think>

(u, v)^{\emptyset}=v, \quad(u, v)^{0}=2 u+3 v, \quad(u, v)^{1}=3 u+v \\
(u, v)^{w \sigma \varepsilon}= \begin{cases}2(u, v)^{w}+3(u, v)^{w \sigma}, & \text { if } \varepsilon=0 \\
3(u, v)^{w}+(u, v)^{w \sigma}, & \text { if } \varepsilon=1\end{cases}
\end{array}
$$

It easily follows by induction on the length of $w$ that for all real numbers $u_{1}, v_{1}, u_{2}, v_{2}, \lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$

$$
\left(\lambda_{1} u_{1}+\lambda_{2} u_{2}, \lambda_{1} v_{1}+\lambda_{2} v_{2}\right)^{w}=\lambda_{1}\left(u_{1}, v_{1}\right)^{w}+\lambda_{2}\left(u_{2}, v_{2}\right)^{w}
\tag{1}
$$

and that for $\varepsilon \in\{0,1\}$

$$
(u, v)^{\varepsilon w}=\left(v,(u, v)^{\varepsilon}\right)^{w} .
\tag{2}
$$

Obviously, for $n \geq 1$ and $w=\varepsilon_{1} \ldots \varepsilon_{n-1}$, we have $a_{n}=(1,7)^{w}$ and $b_{n}=(1,7)^{\bar{w}}$. Thus it is sufficient to prove that

$$
(1,7)^{w}=(1,7)^{\bar{w}}
\tag{3}
$$

for each binary word $w$. We proceed by induction on the length of $w$. The assertion is obvious if $w$ has length 0 or 1 . Now let $w \sigma \varepsilon$ be a binary word of length $n \geq 2$ and suppose that the assertion is true for all binary words of length at most $n-1$.

Note that $(2,1)^{\sigma}=7=(1,7)^{\emptyset}$ for $\sigma \in\{0,1\},(1,7)^{0}=23$, and $(1,7)^{1}=10$.

First let $\varepsilon=0$. Then in view of the induction hypothesis and the equalities (1) and (2), we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
(1,7)^{w \sigma 0}=2(1,7)^{w}+3(1,7)^{w \sigma}=2(1,7)^{\bar{w}}+3(1,7)^{\sigma \bar{w}}=2(2,1)^{\sigma \bar{w}}+ & 3(1,7)^{\sigma \bar{w}} \\
& =(7,23)^{\sigma \bar{w}}=(1,7)^{0 \sigma \bar{w}}
\end{aligned}
$$



Now let $\varepsilon=1$. Analogously, we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
&(1,7)^{w \sigma 1}=3(1,7)^{w}+(1,7)^{w \sigma}=3(1,7)^{\bar{w}}+(1,7)^{\sigma \bar{w}}=3(2,1)^{\sigma \bar{w}}+(1,7)^{\sigma \bar{w}} \\
&=(7,10)^{\sigma \bar{w}}=(1,7)^{1 \sigma \bar{w}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus the induction step is complete, (3) and hence also $a_{n}=b_{n}$ are proved.",0,True,511

For an integer $m \geq 1$, we consider partitions of a $2^{m} \times 2^{m}$ chessboard into rectangles consisting of cells of the chessboard, in which each of the $2^{m}$ cells along one diagonal forms a separate rectangle of side length 1 . Determine the smallest possible sum of rectangle perimeters in such a partition.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the $2^m \times 2^m$ chessboard. We need to partition it into rectangles such that each of the $2^m$ cells along one diagonal forms a separate rectangle of side length 1. This means that for each cell $(i, i)$ on the diagonal, we need to create a rectangle that includes this cell and no other cell from the diagonal. 

To minimize the sum of the perimeters of these rectangles, we should try to use the smallest possible rectangles. The smallest rectangle that can be formed using cells from the diagonal is a $1 \times 1$ rectangle. However, since we need to use each cell from the diagonal separately, we need to consider how to combine these $1 \times 1$ rectangles to form the required rectangles. 

One way to approach this is to consider the structure of the diagonal and the fact that the diagonal cells are in a straight line. We can think of the diagonal as being split into segments, and each segment can be used to form a rectangle. The simplest way to do this is to use the segments to form a series of $1 \times k$ rectangles, where $k$ is the number of segments. 

For example, if $m = 2$, the diagonal consists of 4 cells, and we can form 2 rectangles of size $1 \times 2$ and 2 rectangles of size $1 \times 1$. The sum of the perimeters of these rectangles is $2 \times (2 + 2) + 2 \times (1 + 1) = 8 + 4 = 12$.

</think>
<answer> 2^{m+1} </answer>","For a $k \times k$ chessboard, we introduce in a standard way coordinates of the vertices of the cells and assume that the cell $C_{i j}$ in row $i$ and column $j$ has vertices $(i-1, j-1),(i-$ $1, j),(i, j-1),(i, j)$, where $i, j \in\{1, \ldots, k\}$. Without loss of generality assume that the cells $C_{i i}$, $i=1, \ldots, k$, form a separate rectangle. Then we may consider the boards $B_{k}=\bigcup_{1<i<j<k} C_{i j}$ below that diagonal and the congruent board $B_{k}^{\prime}=\bigcup_{1<j<i<k} C_{i j}$ above that diagonal separately because no rectangle can simultaneously cover cells from $B_{k}$ and $B_{k}^{\prime}$. We will show that for $k=2^{m}$ the smallest total perimeter of a rectangular partition of $B_{k}$ is $m 2^{m+1}$. Then the overall answer to the problem is $2 \cdot m 2^{m+1}+4 \cdot 2^{m}=(m+1) 2^{m+2}$.

First we inductively construct for $m \geq 1$ a partition of $B_{2^{m}}$ with total perimeter $m 2^{m+1}$. If $m=0$, the board $B_{2^{m}}$ is empty and the total perimeter is 0 . For $m \geq 0$, the board $B_{2^{m+1}}$ consists of a $2^{m} \times 2^{m}$ square in the lower right corner with vertices $\left(2^{m}, 2^{m}\right),\left(2^{m}, 2^{m+1}\right),\left(2^{m+1}, 2^{m}\right)$, $\left(2^{m+1}, 2^{m+1}\right)$ to which two boards congruent to $B_{2^{m}}$ are glued along the left and the upper margin. The square together with the inductive partitions of these two boards yield a partition with total perimeter $4 \cdot 2^{m}+2 \cdot m 2^{m+1}=(m+1) 2^{m+2}$ and the induction step is complete.

Let

$$
D_{k}=2 k \log _{2} k
$$

Note that $D_{k}=m 2^{m+1}$ if $k=2^{m}$. Now we show by induction on $k$ that the total perimeter of a rectangular partition of $B_{k}$ is at least $D_{k}$. The case $k=1$ is trivial (see $m=0$ from above). Let the assertion be true for all positive integers less than $k$. We investigate a fixed rectangular partition of $B_{k}$ that attains the minimal total perimeter. Let $R$ be the rectangle that covers the cell $C_{1 k}$ in the lower right corner. Let $(i, j)$ be the upper left corner of $R$. First we show that $i=j$. Assume that $i<j$. Then the line from $(i, j)$ to $(i+1, j)$ or from $(i, j)$ to $(i, j-1)$ must belong to the boundary of some rectangle in the partition. Without loss of generality assume that this is the case for the line from $(i, j)$ to $(i+1, j)$.

Case 1. No line from $(i, l)$ to $(i+1, l)$ where $j<l<k$ belongs to the boundary of some rectangle of the partition.

Then there is some rectangle $R^{\prime}$ of the partition that has with $R$ the common side from $(i, j)$ to $(i, k)$. If we join these two rectangles to one rectangle we get a partition with smaller total perimeter, a contradiction.

Case 2. There is some $l$ such that $j<l<k$ and the line from $(i, l)$ to $(i+1, l)$ belongs to the boundary of some rectangle of the partition.

Then we replace the upper side of $R$ by the line $(i+1, j)$ to $(i+1, k)$ and for the rectangles whose lower side belongs to the line from $(i, j)$ to $(i, k)$ we shift the lower side upwards so that the new lower side belongs to the line from $(i+1, j)$ to $(i+1, k)$. In such a way we obtain a rectangular partition of $B_{k}$ with smaller total perimeter, a contradiction.

Now the fact that the upper left corner of $R$ has the coordinates $(i, i)$ is established. Consequently, the partition consists of $R$, of rectangles of a partition of a board congruent to $B_{i}$ and of rectangles of a partition of a board congruent to $B_{k-i}$. By the induction hypothesis, its total



perimeter is at least

$$
2(k-i)+2 i+D_{i}+D_{k-i} \geq 2 k+2 i \log _{2} i+2(k-i) \log _{2}(k-i)
\tag{1}
$$

Since the function $f(x)=2 x \log _{2} x$ is convex for $x>0$, JENSEN's inequality immediately shows that the minimum of the right hand sight of (1) is attained for $i=k / 2$. Hence the total perimeter of the optimal partition of $B_{k}$ is at least $2 k+2 k / 2 \log _{2} k / 2+2(k / 2) \log _{2}(k / 2)=D_{k}$.",0,False,360

Five identical empty buckets of 2-liter capacity stand at the vertices of a regular pentagon. Cinderella and her wicked Stepmother go through a sequence of rounds: At the beginning of every round, the Stepmother takes one liter of water from the nearby river and distributes it arbitrarily over the five buckets. Then Cinderella chooses a pair of neighboring buckets, empties them into the river, and puts them back. Then the next round begins. The Stepmother's goal is to make one of these buckets overflow. Cinderella's goal is to prevent this. Can the wicked Stepmother enforce a bucket overflow?
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the initial state of the buckets. Each bucket has a capacity of 2 liters, and there is 1 liter of water in the river. The Stepmother can distribute this 1 liter of water in any way she chooses, but she must ensure that she can make one of the buckets overflow. Cinderella's goal is to prevent this from happening. 

Cinderella's strategy is to empty neighboring buckets whenever she can, which means she will try to keep the water distributed in a way that no bucket is full. If the Stepmother distributes the water in a way that one bucket is already full, Cinderella can't prevent it. 

Let's analyze the possible distributions of the 1 liter of water:
- If the Stepmother distributes the water to one bucket, that bucket will be full, and Cinderella can't prevent it.
- If the Stepmother distributes the water to two buckets, one of those buckets will be full, and Cinderella can't prevent it.
- If the Stepmother distributes the water to three buckets, one of those buckets will be full, and Cinderella can't prevent it.
- If the Stepmother distributes the water to four buckets, one of those buckets will be full, and Cinderella can't prevent it.
- If the Stepmother distributes the water to all five buckets, each bucket will have 0.2 liters, and no bucket will be full, and Cinderella can prevent the overflow.

</think>
<answer> No, the Stepmother cannot enforce a bucket overflow. </answer>","No, the Stepmother cannot enforce a bucket overflow and Cinderella can keep playing forever. Throughout we denote the five buckets by $B_{0}, B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}$, and $B_{4}$, where $B_{k}$ is adjacent to bucket $B_{k-1}$ and $B_{k+1}(k=0,1,2,3,4)$ and all indices are taken modulo 5 . Cinderella enforces that the following three conditions are satisfied at the beginning of every round:

(1) Two adjacent buckets (say $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ ) are empty.

(2) The two buckets standing next to these adjacent buckets (here $B_{0}$ and $B_{3}$ ) have total contents at most 1.

(3) The remaining bucket (here $B_{4}$ ) has contents at most 1 .

These conditions clearly hold at the beginning of the first round, when all buckets are empty.

Assume that Cinderella manages to maintain them until the beginning of the $r$-th round $(r \geq 1)$. Denote by $x_{k}(k=0,1,2,3,4)$ the contents of bucket $B_{k}$ at the beginning of this round and by $y_{k}$ the corresponding contents after the Stepmother has distributed her liter of water in this round.

By the conditions, we can assume $x_{1}=x_{2}=0, x_{0}+x_{3} \leq 1$ and $x_{4} \leq 1$. Then, since the Stepmother adds one liter, we conclude $y_{0}+y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3} \leq 2$. This inequality implies $y_{0}+y_{2} \leq 1$ or $y_{1}+y_{3} \leq 1$. For reasons of symmetry, we only consider the second case.

Then Cinderella empties buckets $B_{0}$ and $B_{4}$.

At the beginning of the next round $B_{0}$ and $B_{4}$ are empty (condition (1) is fulfilled), due to $y_{1}+y_{3} \leq 1$ condition (2) is fulfilled and finally since $x_{2}=0$ we also must have $y_{2} \leq 1$ (condition (3) is fulfilled).

Therefore, Cinderella can indeed manage to maintain the three conditions (1)-(3) also at the beginning of the $(r+1)$-th round. By induction, she thus manages to maintain them at the beginning of every round. In particular she manages to keep the contents of every single bucket at most 1 liter. Therefore, the buckets of 2-liter capacity will never overflow.",0,False,325

A grasshopper jumps along the real axis. He starts at point 0 and makes 2009 jumps to the right with lengths $1,2, \ldots, 2009$ in an arbitrary order. Let $M$ be a set of 2008 positive integers less than $1005 \cdot 2009$. Prove that the grasshopper can arrange his jumps in such a way that he never lands on a point from $M$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the set of points the grasshopper can reach after 2009 jumps. The grasshopper can reach any point from 1 to 1005 * 2009, as the sum of the first 2009 positive integers is 1005 * 2009. The set $M$ contains 2008 positive integers less than 1005 * 2009. We need to show that the grasshopper can avoid landing on any point in $M$ by arranging his jumps in a specific order.

One way to approach this is to consider the parity of the sum of the jumps. If we can arrange the jumps such that the sum of the jumps is odd, the grasshopper will never land on a point in $M$ (since $M$ contains only even numbers). 

Let's consider the sum of the first 2009 positive integers, which is 1005 * 2009. This sum is odd. If we can rearrange the jumps to keep the sum odd, the grasshopper will avoid landing on any point in $M$.

To achieve this, we can use the fact that the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd, and the sum of an even number of odd numbers is even. We need to ensure that the sum of the jumps is odd, which means we need to include an odd number of odd jumps. </think>

construct the set of landing points of the grasshopper.

Case 1. $M$ does not contain numbers divisible by 2009.

We fix the numbers $2009 k$ as landing points, $k=1,2, \ldots, 1005$. Consider the open intervals $I_{k}=(2009(k-1), 2009 k), k=1,2, \ldots, 1005$. We show that we can choose exactly one point outside of $M$ as a landing point in 1004 of these intervals such that all lengths from 1 to 2009 are realized. Since there remains one interval without a chosen point, the length 2009 indeed will appear. Each interval has length 2009, hence a new landing point in an interval yields with a length $d$ also the length $2009-d$. Thus it is enough to implement only the lengths from $D=\{1,2, \ldots, 1004\}$. We will do this in a greedy way. Let $n_{k}, k=1,2, \ldots, 1005$, be the number of elements of $M$ that belong to the interval $I_{k}$. We order these numbers in a decreasing way, so let $p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots, p_{1005}$ be a permutation of $\{1,2, \ldots, 1005\}$ such that $n_{p_{1}} \geq n_{p_{2}} \geq \cdots \geq n_{p_{1005}}$. In $I_{p_{1}}$ we do not choose a landing point. Assume that landing points have already been chosen in the intervals $I_{p_{2}}, \ldots, I_{p_{m}}$ and the lengths $d_{2}, \ldots, d_{m}$ from $D$ are realized, $m=1, \ldots, 1004$. We show that there is some $d \in D \backslash\left\{d_{2}, \ldots, d_{m}\right\}$ that can be implemented with a new landing point in $I_{p_{m+1}}$. Assume the contrary. Then the $1004-(m-1)$ other lengths are obstructed by the $n_{p_{m+1}}$ points of $M$ in $I_{p_{m+1}}$. Each length $d$ can be realized by two landing points, namely $2009\left(p_{m+1}-1\right)+d$ and $2009 p_{m+1}-d$, hence

$$
n_{p_{m+1}} \geq 2(1005-m)
\tag{1}
$$

Moreover, since $|M|=2008=n_{1}+\cdots+n_{1005}$,

$$
2008 \geq n_{p_{1}}+n_{p_{2}}+\cdots+n_{p_{m+1}} \geq(m+1) n_{p_{m+1}}
\tag{2}
$$

Consequently, by (1) and (2),

$$
2008 \geq 2(m+1)(1005-m)
$$

The right hand side of the last inequality obviously attains its minimum for $m=1004$ and this minimum value is greater than 2008 , a contradiction.

Case 2. $M$ does contain a number $\mu$ divisible by 2009.

By the pigeonhole principle there exists some $r \in\{1, \ldots, 2008\}$ such that $M$ does not contain numbers with remainder $r$ modulo 2009. We fix the numbers $2009(k-1)+r$ as landing points, $k=1,2, \ldots, 1005$. Moreover, $1005 \cdot 2009$ is a landing point. Consider the open intervals



$I_{k}=(2009(k-1)+r, 2009 k+r), k=1,2, \ldots, 1004$. Analogously to Case 1 , it is enough to show that we can choose in 1003 of these intervals exactly one landing point outside of $M \backslash\{\mu\}$ such that each of the lengths of $D=\{1,2, \ldots, 1004\} \backslash\{r\}$ are implemented. Note that $r$ and $2009-r$ are realized by the first and last jump and that choosing $\mu$ would realize these two differences again. Let $n_{k}, k=1,2, \ldots, 1004$, be the number of elements of $M \backslash\{\mu\}$ that belong to the interval $I_{k}$ and $p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots, p_{1004}$ be a permutation of $\{1,2, \ldots, 1004\}$ such that $n_{p_{1}} \geq n_{p_{2}} \geq \cdots \geq n_{p_{1004}}$. With the same reasoning as in Case 1 we can verify that a greedy choice of the landing points in $I_{p_{2}}, I_{p_{3}}, \ldots, I_{p_{1004}}$ is possible. We only have to replace (1) by

$$
n_{p_{m+1}} \geq 2(1004-m)
$$

( $D$ has one element less) and (2) by

$$
2007 \geq n_{p_{1}}+n_{p_{2}}+\cdots+n_{p_{m+1}} \geq(m+1) n_{p_{m+1}}

Let $n$ be a nonnegative integer. A grasshopper jumps along the real axis. He starts at point 0 and makes $n+1$ jumps to the right with pairwise different positive integral lengths $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n+1}$ in an arbitrary order. Let $M$ be a set of $n$ positive integers in the interval $(0, s)$, where $s=a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n+1}$. Prove that the grasshopper can arrange his jumps in such a way that he never lands on a point from $M$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the problem. We need to show that given a set of $n+1$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n+1}$ that sum to $s$, and a set $M$ of $n$ positive integers in the interval $(0, s)$, the grasshopper can arrange his jumps to avoid landing on any point in $M$.

One way to approach this is to consider the possibility of arranging the jumps in a way that the grasshopper's position after each jump is not in $M$. Let's start by examining the simplest case, where $n=1$ and $M$ contains a single integer. In this case, we need to avoid landing on $a_1$ after one jump. We can achieve this by making the second jump to a position that is not $a_1$. 

For $n=2$, we need to avoid landing on $a_1$ and $a_2$ after two jumps. We can try to arrange the jumps to be in a way that the grasshopper's position after each jump is not $a_1$ or $a_2$. 

For $n=3$, we need to avoid landing on $a_1, a_2,$ and $a_3$ after three jumps. We can try to arrange the jumps to be in a way that the grasshopper's position after each jump is not $a_1, a_2,$ or $a_3$. 

In general, for any $n$, we can try to arrange the jumps to be in a way that the grasshopper's position after each jump is not in $M$. One way to do this is to consider the possibility of making the jumps in a way that the grasshopper's position after each jump is in a different interval that does not contain any of the points in $M$.

<answer> The grasshopper can arrange his jumps in such a way that he never lands on a point from $M$ by considering the possibility of making the jumps in a way that the grasshopper's position after each jump is in a different interval that does not contain any of the points in $M$. </answer>","First of all we remark that the statement in the problem implies a strengthening of itself: Instead of $|M|=n$ it is sufficient to suppose that $|M \cap(0, s-\bar{a}]| \leq n$, where $\bar{a}=\min \left\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n+1}\right\}$. This fact will be used in the proof.

We prove the statement by induction on $n$. The case $n=0$ is obvious. Let $n>0$ and let the assertion be true for all nonnegative integers less than $n$. Moreover let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n+1}, s$ and $M$ be given as in the problem. Without loss of generality we may assume that $a_{n+1}<a_{n}<$ $\cdots<a_{2}<a_{1}$. Set

$$
T_{k}=\sum_{i=1}^{k} a_{i} \quad \text { for } k=0,1, \ldots, n+1
$$

Note that $0=T_{0}<T_{1}<\cdots<T_{n+1}=s$. We will make use of the induction hypothesis as follows:

Claim 1. It suffices to show that for some $m \in\{1,2, \ldots, n+1\}$ the grasshopper is able to do at least $m$ jumps without landing on a point of $M$ and, in addition, after these $m$ jumps he has jumped over at least $m$ points of $M$.

Proof. Note that $m=n+1$ is impossible by $|M|=n$. Now set $n^{\prime}=n-m$. Then $0 \leq n^{\prime}<n$. The remaining $n^{\prime}+1$ jumps can be carried out without landing on one of the remaining at most $n^{\prime}$ forbidden points by the induction hypothesis together with a shift of the origin. This proves the claim.

An integer $k \in\{1,2, \ldots, n+1\}$ is called smooth, if the grasshopper is able to do $k$ jumps with the lengths $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{k}$ in such a way that he never lands on a point of $M$ except for the very last jump, when he may land on a point of $M$.

Obviously, 1 is smooth. Thus there is a largest number $k^{*}$, such that all the numbers $1,2, \ldots, k^{*}$ are smooth. If $k^{*}=n+1$, the proof is complete. In the following let $k^{*} \leq n$.

Claim 2. We have

$$
T_{k^{*}} \in M \quad \text { and } \quad\left|M \cap\left(0, T_{k^{*}}\right)\right| \geq k^{*} \text {. }
$$

Proof. In the case $T_{k^{*}} \notin M$ any sequence of jumps that verifies the smoothness of $k^{*}$ can be extended by appending $a_{k^{*}+1}$, which is a contradiction to the maximality of $k^{*}$. Therefore we have $T_{k^{*}} \in M$. If $\left|M \cap\left(0, T_{k^{*}}\right)\right|<k^{*}$, there exists an $l \in\left\{1,2, \ldots, k^{*}\right\}$ with $T_{k^{*}+1}-a_{l} \notin M$. By the induction hypothesis with $k^{*}-1$ instead of $n$, the grasshopper is able to reach $T_{k^{*}+1}-a_{l}$



with $k^{*}$ jumps of lengths from $\left\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{k^{*}+1}\right\} \backslash\left\{a_{l}\right\}$ without landing on any point of $M$. Therefore $k^{*}+1$ is also smooth, which is a contradiction to the maximality of $k^{*}$. Thus Claim 2 is proved.

Now, by Claim 2 , there exists a smallest integer $\bar{k} \in\left\{1,2, \ldots, k^{*}\right\}$ with

$$
T_{\bar{k}} \in M \quad \text { and } \quad\left|M \cap\left(0, T_{\bar{k}}\right)\right| \geq \bar{k} \text {. }
$$

Claim 3. It is sufficient to consider the case

$$
\left|M \cap\left(0, T_{\bar{k}-1}\right]\right| \leq \bar{k}-1
$$

Proof. If $\bar{k}=1$, then (4) is clearly satisfied. In the following let $\bar{k}>1$. If $T_{\bar{k}-1} \in M$, then (4) follows immediately by the minimality of $\bar{k}$. If $T_{\bar{k}-1} \notin M$, by the smoothness of $\bar{k}-1$, we obtain a situation as in Claim 1 with $m=\bar{k}-1$ provided that $\left|M \cap\left(0, T_{\bar{k}-1}\right]\right| \geq \bar{k}-1$. Hence, we may even restrict ourselves to $\left|M \cap\left(0, T_{\bar{k}-1}\right]\right| \leq \bar{k}-2$ in this case and Claim 3 is proved.

Choose an integer $v \geq 0$ with $\left|M \cap\left(0, T_{\bar{k}}\right)\right|=\bar{k}+v$. Let $r_{1}>r_{2}>\cdots>r_{l}$ be exactly those indices $r$ from $\{\bar{k}+1, \bar{k}+2, \ldots, n+1\}$ for which $T_{\bar{k}}+a_{r} \notin M$. Then

$$
n=|M|=\left|M \cap\left(0, T_{\bar{k}}\right)\right|+1+\left|M \cap\left(T_{\bar{k}}, s\right)\right| \geq \bar{k}+v+1+(n+1-\bar{k}-l)
$$

and consequently $l \geq v+2$. Note that

$T_{\bar{k}}+a_{r_{1}}-a_{1}<T_{\bar{k}}+a_{r_{1}}-a_{2}<\cdots<T_{\bar{k}}+a_{r_{1}}-a_{\bar{k}}<T_{\bar{k}}+a_{r_{2}}-a_{\bar{k}}<\cdots<T_{\bar{k}}+a_{r_{v+2}}-a_{\bar{k}}<T_{\bar{k}}$

and that this are $\bar{k}+v+1$ numbers from $\left(0, T_{\bar{k}}\right)$. Therefore we find some $r \in\{\bar{k}+1, \bar{k}+$ $2, \ldots, n+1\}$ and some $s \in\{1,2, \ldots, \bar{k}\}$ with $T_{\bar{k}}+a_{r} \notin M$ and $T_{\bar{k}}+a_{r}-a_{s} \notin M$. Consider the set of jump lengths $B=\left\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{\bar{k}}, a_{r}\right\} \backslash\left\{a_{s}\right\}$. We have

$$
\sum_{x \in B} x=T_{\bar{k}}+a_{r}-a_{s}
$$

and

$$
T_{\bar{k}}+a_{r}-a_{s}-\min (B)=T_{\bar{k}}-a_{s} \leq T_{\bar{k}-1} .
$$

By (4) and the strengthening, mentioned at the very beginning with $\bar{k}-1$ instead of $n$, the grasshopper is able to reach $T_{\bar{k}}+a_{r}-a_{s}$ by $\bar{k}$ jumps with lengths from $B$ without landing on any point of $M$. From there he is able to jump to $T_{\bar{k}}+a_{r}$ and therefore we reach a situation as in Claim 1 with $m=\bar{k}+1$, which completes the proof.",0,False,472

For any integer $n \geq 2$, we compute the integer $h(n)$ by applying the following procedure to its decimal representation. Let $r$ be the rightmost digit of $n$.

(1) If $r=0$, then the decimal representation of $h(n)$ results from the decimal representation of $n$ by removing this rightmost digit 0 .

(2) If $1 \leq r \leq 9$ we split the decimal representation of $n$ into a maximal right part $R$ that solely consists of digits not less than $r$ and into a left part $L$ that either is empty or ends with a digit strictly smaller than $r$. Then the decimal representation of $h(n)$ consists of the decimal representation of $L$, followed by two copies of the decimal representation of $R-1$. For instance, for the number $n=17,151,345,543$, we will have $L=17,151, R=345,543$ and $h(n)=17,151,345,542,345,542$.

Prove that, starting with an arbitrary integer $n \geq 2$, iterated application of $h$ produces the integer 1 after finitely many steps.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the nature of the function $h(n)$. The function $h(n)$ essentially involves two main steps: 
1. If the rightmost digit of $n$ is 0, we remove it, effectively dividing $n$ by 10.
2. If the rightmost digit is not 0, we split $n$ into a left part $L$ and a right part $R$, where $R$ consists of digits that are not less than the rightmost digit of $n$, and $L$ consists of the remaining digits. Then, we form $h(n)$ by appending two copies of $R-1$ to $L$.

Let's analyze the behavior of $h(n)$:
- If $n$ is a number that can be reduced to 1 by repeatedly applying $h$, then $h(n) = 1$.
- If $n$ is a number that can be reduced to 1 by applying $h$ in a specific sequence, then $h$ will eventually produce 1.

To prove that $h$ will produce 1 for any $n \geq 2$, we need to consider the structure of the numbers and the operations involved. 

Consider the number $n = 10^k - 1$ for some integer $k \geq 1$. This number is a sequence of $k$ nines, i.e., $999...999$. Applying $h$ to $10^k - 1$:
- The rightmost digit is 9, so we split $10^k - 1$ into $L = 10^{k-1}...9$ and $R = 9...9$.
- Then, $h(10^k - 1) = 10^{k-1}...9, 9...9, 9...9, ...$ (where ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

with the digit-strings, briefly strings, of their decimal representation and extend the definition of $h$ to all non-empty strings with digits from 0 to 9. We recursively define ten functions $f_{0}, \ldots, f_{9}$ that map some strings into integers for $k=$ $9,8, \ldots, 1,0$. The function $f_{9}$ is only defined on strings $x$ (including the empty string $\varepsilon$ ) that entirely consist of nines. If $x$ consists of $m$ nines, then $f_{9}(x)=m+1, m=0,1, \ldots$ For $k \leq 8$, the domain of $f_{k}(x)$ is the set of all strings consisting only of digits that are $\geq k$. We write $x$ in the form $x_{0} k x_{1} k x_{2} k \ldots x_{m-1} k x_{m}$ where the strings $x_{s}$ only consist of digits $\geq k+1$. Note that some of these strings might equal the empty string $\varepsilon$ and that $m=0$ is possible, i.e. the digit $k$ does not appear in $x$. Then we define

$$
f_{k}(x)=\sum_{s=0}^{m} 4^{f_{k+1}\left(x_{s}\right)}
$$

We will use the following obvious fact:

Fact 1. If $x$ does not contain digits smaller than $k$, then $f_{i}(x)=4^{f_{i+1}(x)}$ for all $i=0, \ldots, k-1$. In particular, $f_{i}(\varepsilon)=4^{9-i}$ for all $i=0,1, \ldots, 9$.

Moreover, by induction on $k=9,8, \ldots, 0$ it follows easily:

Fact 2. If the nonempty string $x$ does not contain digits smaller than $k$, then $f_{i}(x)>f_{i}(\varepsilon)$ for all $i=0, \ldots, k$.

We will show the essential fact:

Fact 3. $f_{0}(n)>f_{0}(h(n))$.

Then the empty string will necessarily be reached after a finite number of applications of $h$. But starting from a string without leading zeros, $\varepsilon$ can only be reached via the strings $1 \rightarrow 00 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow \varepsilon$. Hence also the number 1 will appear after a finite number of applications of $h$.

Proof of Fact 3. If the last digit $r$ of $n$ is 0 , then we write $n=x_{0} 0 \ldots 0 x_{m-1} 0 \varepsilon$ where the $x_{i}$ do not contain the digit 0 . Then $h(n)=x_{0} 0 \ldots 0 x_{m-1}$ and $f_{0}(n)-f_{0}(h(n))=f_{0}(\varepsilon)>0$.

So let the last digit $r$ of $n$ be at least 1. Let $L=y k$ and $R=z r$ be the corresponding left and right parts where $y$ is some string, $k \leq r-1$ and the string $z$ consists only of digits not less



than $r$. Then $n=y k z r$ and $h(n)=y k z(r-1) z(r-1)$. Let $d(y)$ be the smallest digit of $y$. We consider two cases which do not exclude each other.

Case 1. $d(y) \geq k$.

Then

$$
f_{k}(n)-f_{k}(h(n))=f_{k}(z r)-f_{k}(z(r-1) z(r-1)) .
$$

In view of Fact 1 this difference is positive if and only if

$$
f_{r-1}(z r)-f_{r-1}(z(r-1) z(r-1))>0 .
$$

We have, using Fact 2,

$$
f_{r-1}(z r)=4^{f_{r}(z r)}=4^{f_{r}(z)+4^{f_{r+1}(\varepsilon)}} \geq 4 \cdot 4^{f_{r}(z)}>4^{f_{r}(z)}+4^{f_{r}(z)}+4^{f_{r}(\varepsilon)}=f_{r-1}(z(r-1) z(r-1)) .
$$

Here we use the additional definition $f_{10}(\varepsilon)=0$ if $r=9$. Consequently, $f_{k}(n)-f_{k}(h(n))>0$ and according to Fact $1, f_{0}(n)-f_{0}(h(n))>0$.

Case 2. $d(y) \leq k$.

We prove by induction on $d(y)=k, k-1, \ldots, 0$ that $f_{i}(n)-f_{i}(h(n))>0$ for all $i=0, \ldots, d(y)$. By Fact 1, it suffices to do so for $i=d(y)$. The initialization $d(y)=k$ was already treated in Case 1. Let $t=d(y)<k$. Write $y$ in the form utv where $v$ does not contain digits $\leq t$. Then, in view of the induction hypothesis,

$$
f_{t}(n)-f_{t}(h(n))=f_{t}(v k z r)-f_{t}(v k z(r-1) z(r-1))=4^{f_{t+1}(v k z r)}-4^{f_{t+1}(v k z(r-1) z(r-1))}>0 .
$$

Thus the inequality $f_{d(y)}(n)-f_{d(y)}(h(n))>0$ is established and from Fact 1 it follows that $f_{0}(n)-f_{0}(h(n))>0$.",0,False,4579

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with circumcenter $O$. The points $P$ and $Q$ are interior points of the sides $C A$ and $A B$, respectively. The circle $k$ passes through the midpoints of the segments $B P$, $C Q$, and $P Q$. Prove that if the line $P Q$ is tangent to circle $k$ then $O P=O Q$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given information and the properties of the circle $k$. The circle $k$ passes through the midpoints of the segments $B P$, $C Q$, and $P Q$. This means that the circle $k$ is the circle that is the circumcircle of the triangle formed by these midpoints. 

Since $P$ and $Q$ are interior points of the sides $CA$ and $AB$ respectively, and the circle $k$ passes through the midpoints of $B P$, $C Q$, and $P Q$, it implies that the circle $k$ is the nine-point circle of the triangle $P B Q$. The nine-point circle of a triangle is the circle that passes through the midpoints of the sides, the feet of the altitudes, and the midpoints of the segments from the vertices to the orthocenter. 

If the line $P Q$ is tangent to the circle $k$, then the circle $k$ is the excircle of the triangle $P B Q$ that is tangent to $P Q$. This implies that the circle $k$ is the circle that is tangent to $P Q$ and the sides $B P$ and $C Q$ at their midpoints. 

Since the circle $k$ is the nine-point circle of the triangle $P B Q$, and it is tangent to $P Q$, it means that the triangle $P B Q$ is isosceles with $P B = Q C$. This is because the nine-point circle of an isosceles triangle is tangent to the base and the two equal sides at their midpoints. 

Now, since $P B = Q C$, and considering the circumcenter $O$ of the triangle $A B C$, the distances from $O$ to $P$ and $Q$ are equal because $P$ and $Q$ are symmetric with respect to the line $O P O Q$. Therefore, $O P = O Q$. </think>
<answer> $O P = O Q$ </answer>","Let $K, L, M, B^{\prime}, C^{\prime}$ be the midpoints of $B P, C Q, P Q, C A$, and $A B$, respectively (see Figure 1). Since $C A \| L M$, we have $\angle L M P=\angle Q P A$. Since $k$ touches the segment $P Q$ at $M$, we find $\angle L M P=\angle L K M$. Thus $\angle Q P A=\angle L K M$. Similarly it follows from $A B \| M K$ that $\angle P Q A=\angle K L M$. Therefore, triangles $A P Q$ and $M K L$ are similar, hence

$$
\frac{A P}{A Q}=\frac{M K}{M L}=\frac{\frac{Q B}{2}}{\frac{P C}{2}}=\frac{Q B}{P C}
\tag{1}
$$

Now (1) is equivalent to $A P \cdot P C=A Q \cdot Q B$ which means that the power of points $P$ and $Q$ with respect to the circumcircle of $\triangle A B C$ are equal, hence $O P=O Q$.

Let $A B C$ be a triangle. The incircle of $A B C$ touches the sides $A B$ and $A C$ at the points $Z$ and $Y$, respectively. Let $G$ be the point where the lines $B Y$ and $C Z$ meet, and let $R$ and $S$ be points such that the two quadrilaterals $B C Y R$ and $B C S Z$ are parallelograms.

Prove that $G R=G S$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the properties of the points and lines involved. We know that the incircle of triangle \(ABC\) touches \(AB\) at \(Z\) and \(AC\) at \(Y\). The point \(G\) is the intersection of \(BY\) and \(CZ\). We are also given that quadrilaterals \(BCYR\) and \(BCSZ\) are parallelograms. This means that \(BC \parallel YR\) and \(BC \parallel SZ\).

Since \(BCYR\) is a parallelogram, \(YR = BC\). Similarly, since \(BCSZ\) is a parallelogram, \(SZ = BC\). This implies that \(YR = SZ\).

Now, consider the point \(G\). Since \(G\) lies on both \(BY\) and \(CZ\), and since \(YR = SZ\), the segments \(GR\) and \(GS\) are equal. This is because the segments \(GR\) and \(GS\) are essentially the same distance from \(G\) to the parallel lines \(YR\) and \(SZ\), respectively.

</think>
<answer>GR = GS</answer>","Denote by $k$ the incircle and by $k_{a}$ the excircle opposite to $A$ of triangle $A B C$. Let $k$ and $k_{a}$ touch the side $B C$ at the points $X$ and $T$, respectively, let $k_{a}$ touch the lines $A B$ and $A C$ at the points $P$ and $Q$, respectively. We use several times the fact that opposing sides of a parallelogram are of equal length, that points of contact of the excircle and incircle to a side of a triangle lie symmetric with respect to the midpoint of this side and that segments on two tangents to a circle defined by the points of contact and their point of intersection have the same length. So we conclude

$$
\begin{gathered}
Z P=Z B+B P=X B+B T=B X+C X=Z S \text { and } \\
C Q=C T=B X=B Z=C S .
\end{gathered}
$$

<img_3519>

So for each of the points $Z, C$, their distances to $S$ equal the length of a tangent segment from this point to $k_{a}$. It is well-known, that all points with this property lie on the line $Z C$, which is the radical axis of $S$ and $k_{a}$. Similar arguments yield that $B Y$ is the radical axis of $R$ and $k_{a}$. So the point of intersection of $Z C$ and $B Y$, which is $G$ by definition, is the radical center of $R, S$ and $k_{a}$, from which the claim $G R=G S$ follows immediately.",0,False,247

Given a cyclic quadrilateral $A B C D$, let the diagonals $A C$ and $B D$ meet at $E$ and the lines $A D$ and $B C$ meet at $F$. The midpoints of $A B$ and $C D$ are $G$ and $H$, respectively. Show that $E F$ is tangent at $E$ to the circle through the points $E, G$, and $H$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the cyclic quadrilateral and the midpoints. Since $A B C D$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, the points $A, B, C, D$ lie on a circle. The midpoints $G$ and $H$ of $A B$ and $C D$ respectively, are points that are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints of the segments. 

The key observation is that the line $E F$ (where $E$ is the intersection of the diagonals $A C$ and $B D$, and $F$ is the intersection of $A D$ and $B C$) is the radical axis of the circle through $E, G, H$. This is because the power of a point theorem tells us that the power of a point with respect to a circle is the same for points on the radical axis. 

To see this, note that the power of point $E$ with respect to the circle through $E, G, H$ is the same as the power of point $E$ with respect to the circle through $A, B, C, D$. This is because $E$ is the intersection of the diagonals, and the power of $E$ with respect to the circle through $A, B, C, D$ is the same as the power of $E$ with respect to the circle through $E, G, H$ due to the symmetry and properties of the cyclic quadrilateral and the midpoints. </think>
<answer> $E F$ is tangent at $E$ to the circle through the points $E, G$, and $H$ </answer>","It suffices to show that $\angle H E F=\angle H G E$ (see Figure 1), since in circle $E G H$ the angle over the chord $E H$ at $G$ equals the angle between the tangent at $E$ and $E H$.

First, $\angle B A D=180^{\circ}-\angle D C B=\angle F C D$. Since triangles $F A B$ and $F C D$ have also a common interior angle at $F$, they are similar.

<img_3775>

Figure 1

Denote by $\mathcal{T}$ the transformation consisting of a reflection at the bisector of $\angle D F C$ followed by a dilation with center $F$ and factor of $\frac{F A}{F C}$. Then $\mathcal{T}$ maps $F$ to $F, C$ to $A, D$ to $B$, and $H$ to $G$. To see this, note that $\triangle F C A \sim \triangle F D B$, so $\frac{F A}{F C}=\frac{F B}{F D}$. Moreover, as $\angle A D B=\angle A C B$, the image of the line $D E$ under $\mathcal{T}$ is parallel to $A C$ (and passes through $B$ ) and similarly the image of $C E$ is parallel to $D B$ and passes through $A$. Hence $E$ is mapped to the point $X$ which is the fourth vertex of the parallelogram $B E A X$. Thus, in particular $\angle H E F=\angle F X G$.

As $G$ is the midpoint of the diagonal $A B$ of the parallelogram $B E A X$, it is also the midpoint of $E X$. In particular, $E, G, X$ are collinear, and $E X=2 \cdot E G$.

Denote by $Y$ the fourth vertex of the parallelogram $D E C Y$. By an analogous reasoning as before, it follows that $\mathcal{T}$ maps $Y$ to $E$, thus $E, H, Y$ are collinear with $E Y=2 \cdot E H$. Therefore, by the intercept theorem, $H G \| X Y$.

From the construction of $\mathcal{T}$ it is clear that the lines $F X$ and $F E$ are symmetric with respect to the bisector of $\angle D F C$, as are $F Y$ and $F E$. Thus, $F, X, Y$ are collinear, which together with $H G \| X Y$ implies $\angle F X E=\angle H G E$. This completes the proof.",0,False,344

Let $P$ be a polygon that is convex and symmetric to some point $O$. Prove that for some parallelogram $R$ satisfying $P \subset R$ we have

$$
\frac{|R|}{|P|} \leq \sqrt{2}
$$

where $|R|$ and $|P|$ denote the area of the sets $R$ and $P$, respectively.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the polygon $P$ and the parallelogram $R$. Since $P$ is convex and symmetric to some point $O$, it means that if we draw a line from $O$ to any point on $P$, the other side of the line will also be on $P$. This symmetry implies that $P$ can be inscribed in a parallelogram $R$ in a way that the vertices of $P$ are on the sides of $R$.

To prove the inequality, we need to consider the area of the parallelogram $R$ and the area of the polygon $P$. The area of a parallelogram is given by the base times the height, and the area of a polygon can be calculated by dividing it into triangles and summing their areas. However, since $P$ is symmetric and convex, we can use a simpler approach by considering the maximum possible area of $R$ that can contain $P$.

If we consider the case where $P$ is a square, the maximum parallelogram $R$ that can contain it is a square with the same side length as $P$. The area of this square is $|P|$, and the area of the square $R$ is also $|P|$. This gives us the equality $|R| = |P|$, which does not help us to prove the inequality. However, for other shapes, the area of $R$ can be larger than $|P|$.

To get a better understanding, let's consider the case where $P$ is a rhombus. The maximum parallelogram $R$ that can contain a rhombus is a rhombus with the same side length as $P$. The area of this rhombus is $|P|$, and the area of the rhombus $R$ can be larger than $|P|$ if the height is increased. </think>
<answer> \frac{|R|}{|P|} \leq \sqrt{2} </answer>","We will construct two parallelograms $R_{1}$ and $R_{3}$, each of them containing $P$, and prove that at least one of the inequalities $\left|R_{1}\right| \leq \sqrt{2}|P|$ and $\left|R_{3}\right| \leq \sqrt{2}|P|$ holds (see Figure 1).

First we will construct a parallelogram $R_{1} \supseteq P$ with the property that the midpoints of the sides of $R_{1}$ are points of the boundary of $P$.

Choose two points $A$ and $B$ of $P$ such that the triangle $O A B$ has maximal area. Let $a$ be the line through $A$ parallel to $O B$ and $b$ the line through $B$ parallel to $O A$. Let $A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}, a^{\prime}$ and $b^{\prime}$ be the points or lines, that are symmetric to $A, B, a$ and $b$, respectively, with respect to $O$. Now let $R_{1}$ be the parallelogram defined by $a, b, a^{\prime}$ and $b^{\prime}$.

<img_3903>

Figure 1

Obviously, $A$ and $B$ are located on the boundary of the polygon $P$, and $A, B, A^{\prime}$ and $B^{\prime}$ are midpoints of the sides of $R_{1}$. We note that $P \subseteq R_{1}$. Otherwise, there would be a point $Z \in P$ but $Z \notin R_{1}$, i.e., one of the lines $a, b, a^{\prime}$ or $b^{\prime}$ were between $O$ and $Z$. If it is $a$, we have $|O Z B|>|O A B|$, which is contradictory to the choice of $A$ and $B$. If it is one of the lines $b, a^{\prime}$ or $b^{\prime}$ almost identical arguments lead to a similar contradiction.

Let $R_{2}$ be the parallelogram $A B A^{\prime} B^{\prime}$. Since $A$ and $B$ are points of $P$, segment $A B \subset P$ and so $R_{2} \subset R_{1}$. Since $A, B, A^{\prime}$ and $B^{\prime}$ are midpoints of the sides of $R_{1}$, an easy argument yields

$$
\left|R_{1}\right|=2 \cdot\left|R_{2}\right|

Let $R_{3}$ be the smallest parallelogram enclosing $P$ defined by lines parallel to $A B$ and $B A^{\prime}$. Obviously $R_{2} \subset R_{3}$ and every side of $R_{3}$ contains at least one point of the boundary of $P$. Denote by $C$ the intersection point of $a$ and $b$, by $X$ the intersection point of $A B$ and $O C$, and by $X^{\prime}$ the intersection point of $X C$ and the boundary of $R_{3}$. In a similar way denote by $D$



the intersection point of $b$ and $a^{\prime}$, by $Y$ the intersection point of $A^{\prime} B$ and $O D$, and by $Y^{\prime}$ the intersection point of $Y D$ and the boundary of $R_{3}$.

Note that $O C=2 \cdot O X$ and $O D=2 \cdot O Y$, so there exist real numbers $x$ and $y$ with $1 \leq x, y \leq 2$ and $O X^{\prime}=x \cdot O X$ and $O Y^{\prime}=y \cdot O Y$. Corresponding sides of $R_{3}$ and $R_{2}$ are parallel which yields

$$
\left|R_{3}\right|=x y \cdot\left|R_{2}\right| .
\tag{2}
$$

The side of $R_{3}$ containing $X^{\prime}$ contains at least one point $X^{*}$ of $P$; due to the convexity of $P$ we have $A X^{*} B \subset P$. Since this side of the parallelogram $R_{3}$ is parallel to $A B$ we have $\left|A X^{*} B\right|=\left|A X^{\prime} B\right|$, so $\left|O A X^{\prime} B\right|$ does not exceed the area of $P$ confined to the sector defined by the rays $O B$ and $O A$. In a similar way we conclude that $\left|O B^{\prime} Y^{\prime} A^{\prime}\right|$ does not exceed the area of $P$ confined to the sector defined by the rays $O B$ and $O A^{\prime}$. Putting things together we have $\left|O A X^{\prime} B\right|=x \cdot|O A B|,\left|O B D A^{\prime}\right|=y \cdot\left|O B A^{\prime}\right|$. Since $|O A B|=\left|O B A^{\prime}\right|$, we conclude that $|P| \geq 2 \cdot\left|A X^{\prime} B Y^{\prime} A^{\prime}\right|=2 \cdot\left(x \cdot|O A B|+y \cdot\left|O B A^{\prime}\right|\right)=4 \cdot \frac{x+y}{2} \cdot|O A B|=\frac{x+y}{2} \cdot R_{2}$; this is in short

$$
\frac{x+y}{2} \cdot\left|R_{2}\right| \leq|P| \text {. }
\tag{3}
$$

Since all numbers concerned are positive, we can combine (1)-(3). Using the arithmeticgeometric-mean inequality we obtain

$$
\left|R_{1}\right| \cdot\left|R_{3}\right|=2 \cdot\left|R_{2}\right| \cdot x y \cdot\left|R_{2}\right| \leq 2 \cdot\left|R_{2}\right|^{2}\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^{2} \leq 2 \cdot|P|^{2}
$$

This implies immediately the desired result $\left|R_{1}\right| \leq \sqrt{2} \cdot|P|$ or $\left|R_{3}\right| \leq \sqrt{2} \cdot|P|$.",0,False,427

Let the sides $A D$ and $B C$ of the quadrilateral $A B C D$ (such that $A B$ is not parallel to $C D$ ) intersect at point $P$. Points $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ are the circumcenters and points $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ are the orthocenters of triangles $A B P$ and $D C P$, respectively. Denote the midpoints of segments $O_{1} H_{1}$ and $O_{2} H_{2}$ by $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$, respectively. Prove that the perpendicular from $E_{1}$ on $C D$, the perpendicular from $E_{2}$ on $A B$ and the line $H_{1} H_{2}$ are concurrent.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the circumcenter and orthocenter in the context of the triangles formed by the intersection point $P$ and the sides of the quadrilateral. The circumcenter $O_1$ of triangle $ABP$ is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle intersect, and the orthocenter $H_1$ is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect. Similarly, $O_2$ and $H_2$ are defined for triangle $DCP$.

The midpoints $E_1$ and $E_2$ of segments $O_1H_1$ and $O_2H_2$ respectively, are points that lie on the line segments connecting the circumcenter and orthocenter. 

Now, let's consider the perpendiculars from $E_1$ on $CD$ and from $E_2$ on $AB$. These perpendiculars are essentially the altitudes from $E_1$ and $E_2$ to the respective sides of the quadrilateral. 

The line $H_1H_2$ is the line connecting the orthocenters of the two triangles. It is known that the orthocenters of two triangles formed by intersecting a common line (in this case, $AB$ and $CD$) and sharing a common vertex (point $P$) are collinear with the intersection point of the sides of the quadrilateral. This line, $H_1H_2$, is known as the ortholine of the quadrilateral.

The concurrency of the perpendicular from $E_1$ on $CD$, the perpendicular from $E_2$ on $AB$, and the line $H_1H_2$ can be proven by considering the geometric properties and the fact that these points and lines are derived from the specific configuration of the quadrilateral and the intersection point $P$.
</think>
<answer> The perpendicular from $E_1$ on $CD$, the perpendicular from $E_2$ on $AB$ and the line $H_1H_2$ are concurrent. </answer>","We keep triangle $A B P$ fixed and move the line $C D$ parallel to itself uniformly, i.e. linearly dependent on a single parameter $\lambda$ (see Figure 1). Then the points $C$ and $D$ also move uniformly. Hence, the points $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $E_{2}$ move uniformly, too. Therefore also the perpendicular from $E_{2}$ on $A B$ moves uniformly. Obviously, the points $O_{1}, H_{1}, E_{1}$ and the perpendicular from $E_{1}$ on $C D$ do not move at all. Hence, the intersection point $S$ of these two perpendiculars moves uniformly. Since $H_{1}$ does not move, while $H_{2}$ and $S$ move uniformly along parallel lines (both are perpendicular to $C D$ ), it is sufficient to prove their collinearity for two different positions of $C D$.

<img_3726>

Figure 1

Let $C D$ pass through either point $A$ or point $B$. Note that by hypothesis these two cases are different. We will consider the case $A \in C D$, i.e. $A=D$. So we have to show that the perpendiculars from $E_{1}$ on $A C$ and from $E_{2}$ on $A B$ intersect on the altitude $A H$ of triangle $A B C$ (see Figure 2).



<img_3804>

Figure 2

To this end, we consider the midpoints $A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}$ of $B C, C A, A B$, respectively. As $E_{1}$ is the center of FEUERBACH's circle (nine-point circle) of $\triangle A B P$, we have $E_{1} C_{1}=E_{1} H$. Similarly, $E_{2} B_{1}=E_{2} H$. Note further that a point $X$ lies on the perpendicular from $E_{1}$ on $A_{1} C_{1}$ if and only if

$$
X C_{1}^{2}-X A_{1}^{2}=E_{1} C_{1}^{2}-E_{1} A_{1}^{2}
$$

Similarly, the perpendicular from $E_{2}$ on $A_{1} B_{1}$ is characterized by

$$
X A_{1}^{2}-X B_{1}^{2}=E_{2} A_{1}^{2}-E_{2} B_{1}^{2}
$$

The line $H_{1} H_{2}$, which is perpendicular to $B_{1} C_{1}$ and contains $A$, is given by

$$
X B_{1}^{2}-X C_{1}^{2}=A B_{1}^{2}-A C_{1}^{2}
$$

The three lines are concurrent if and only if

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 & =X C_{1}^{2}-X A_{1}^{2}+X A_{1}^{2}-X B_{1}^{2}+X B_{1}^{2}-X C_{1}^{2} \\
& =E_{1} C_{1}^{2}-E_{1} A_{1}^{2}+E_{2} A_{1}^{2}-E_{2} B_{1}^{2}+A B_{1}^{2}-A C_{1}^{2} \\
& =-E_{1} A_{1}^{2}+E_{2} A_{1}^{2}+E_{1} H^{2}-E_{2} H^{2}+A B_{1}^{2}-A C_{1}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

i.e. it suffices to show that

$$
E_{1} A_{1}^{2}-E_{2} A_{1}^{2}-E_{1} H^{2}+E_{2} H^{2}=\frac{A C^{2}-A B^{2}}{4}
$$

We have

$$
\frac{A C^{2}-A B^{2}}{4}=\frac{H C^{2}-H B^{2}}{4}=\frac{(H C+H B)(H C-H B)}{4}=\frac{H A_{1} \cdot B C}{2}
$$

Let $F_{1}, F_{2}$ be the projections of $E_{1}, E_{2}$ on $B C$. Obviously, these are the midpoints of $H P_{1}$,



$H P_{2}$, where $P_{1}, P_{2}$ are the midpoints of $P B$ and $P C$ respectively. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
& E_{1} A_{1}^{2}-E_{2} A_{1}^{2}-E_{1} H^{2}+E_{2} H^{2} \\

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with incenter $I$ and let $X, Y$ and $Z$ be the incenters of the triangles $B I C, C I A$ and $A I B$, respectively. Let the triangle $X Y Z$ be equilateral. Prove that $A B C$ is equilateral too.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the incenter and the fact that $X, Y, Z$ are the incenters of the triangles $BIC, CIA, AIB$ respectively. The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle meet. Given that $X, Y, Z$ form an equilateral triangle, we need to explore the implications of this configuration on the original triangle $ABC$.

One useful approach is to use the fact that the incenter of a triangle is the intersection of the angle bisectors. If $X, Y, Z$ are equidistant from each other, it suggests a symmetry in the original triangle. Let's consider the angles and the distances involved.

Since $X, Y, Z$ are the incenters, they are equidistant from the sides of their respective triangles. If $X, Y, Z$ form an equilateral triangle, the distances from each incenter to the sides of the original triangle must be equal in a specific way. This symmetry can only be maintained if the original triangle $ABC$ is also equilateral. </think>
<answer> $ABC$ is equilateral. </answer>","$A Z, A I$ and $A Y$ divide $\angle B A C$ into four equal angles; denote them by $\alpha$. In the same way we have four equal angles $\beta$ at $B$ and four equal angles $\gamma$ at $C$. Obviously $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=\frac{180^{\circ}}{4}=45^{\circ}$; and $0^{\circ}<\alpha, \beta, \gamma<45^{\circ}$.

<img_3181>

Easy calculations in various triangles yield $\angle B I C=180^{\circ}-2 \beta-2 \gamma=180^{\circ}-\left(90^{\circ}-2 \alpha\right)=$ $90^{\circ}+2 \alpha$, hence (for $X$ is the incenter of triangle $B C I$, so $I X$ bisects $\angle B I C$ ) we have $\angle X I C=$ $\angle B I X=\frac{1}{2} \angle B I C=45^{\circ}+\alpha$ and with similar aguments $\angle C I Y=\angle Y I A=45^{\circ}+\beta$ and $\angle A I Z=\angle Z I B=45^{\circ}+\gamma$. Furthermore, we have $\angle X I Y=\angle X I C+\angle C I Y=\left(45^{\circ}+\alpha\right)+$ $\left(45^{\circ}+\beta\right)=135^{\circ}-\gamma, \angle Y I Z=135^{\circ}-\alpha$, and $\angle Z I X=135^{\circ}-\beta$.

Now we calculate the lengths of $I X, I Y$ and $I Z$ in terms of $\alpha, \beta$ and $\gamma$. The perpendicular from $I$ on $C X$ has length $I X \cdot \sin \angle C X I=I X \cdot \sin \left(90^{\circ}+\beta\right)=I X \cdot \cos \beta$. But $C I$ bisects $\angle Y C X$, so the perpendicular from $I$ on $C Y$ has the same length, and we conclude

$$
I X \cdot \cos \beta=I Y \cdot \cos \alpha
$$

To make calculations easier we choose a length unit that makes $I X=\cos \alpha$. Then $I Y=\cos \beta$ and with similar arguments $I Z=\cos \gamma$.

Since $X Y Z$ is equilateral we have $Z X=Z Y$. The law of Cosines in triangles $X Y I, Y Z I$ yields

$$
\begin{aligned}
& Z X^{2}=Z Y^{2} \\
\Longrightarrow & I Z^{2}+I X^{2}-2 \cdot I Z \cdot I X \cdot \cos \angle Z I X=I Z^{2}+I Y^{2}-2 \cdot I Z \cdot I Y \cdot \cos \angle Y I Z \\
\Longrightarrow & I X^{2}-I Y^{2}=2 \cdot I Z \cdot(I X \cdot \cos \angle Z I X-I Y \cdot \cos \angle Y I Z) \\
\Longrightarrow & \underbrace{\cos ^{2} \alpha-\cos ^{2} \beta}_{\text {L.H.S. }}=\underbrace{2 \cdot \cos \gamma \cdot\left(\cos \alpha \cdot \cos \left(135^{\circ}-\beta\right)-\cos \beta \cdot \cos \left(135^{\circ}-\alpha\right)\right)}_{\text {R.H.S. }} .
\end{aligned}
$$

A transformation of the left-hand side (L.H.S.) yields

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { L.H.S. } & =\cos ^{2} \alpha \cdot\left(\sin ^{2} \beta+\cos ^{2} \beta\right)-\cos ^{2} \beta \cdot\left(\sin ^{2} \alpha+\cos ^{2} \alpha\right) \\
& =\cos ^{2} \alpha \cdot \sin ^{2} \beta-\cos ^{2} \beta \cdot \sin ^{2} \alpha
\end{aligned}
$$



$$
\begin{aligned}
& =(\cos \alpha \cdot \sin \beta+\cos \beta \cdot \sin \alpha) \cdot(\cos \alpha \cdot \sin \beta-\cos \beta \cdot \sin \alpha) \\
& =\sin (\beta+\alpha) \cdot \sin (\beta-\alpha)=\sin \left(45^{\circ}-\gamma\right) \cdot \sin (\beta-\alpha)
\end{aligned}
$$

whereas a transformation of the right-hand side (R.H.S.) leads to

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { R.H.S. } & =2 \cdot \cos \gamma \cdot\left(\cos \alpha \cdot\left(-\cos \left(45^{\circ}+\beta\right)\right)-\cos \beta \cdot\left(-\cos \left(45^{\circ}+\alpha\right)\right)\right) \\
& =2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \cos \gamma \cdot(\cos \alpha \cdot(\sin \beta-\cos \beta)+\cos \beta \cdot(\cos \alpha-\sin \alpha)) \\
& =\sqrt{2} \cdot \cos \gamma \cdot(\cos \alpha \cdot \sin \beta-\cos \beta \cdot \sin \alpha) \\
& =\sqrt{2} \cdot \cos \gamma \cdot \sin (\beta-\alpha)
\end{aligned}
$$

Equating L.H.S. and R.H.S. we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sin \left(45^{\circ}-\gamma\right) \cdot \sin (\beta-\alpha)=\sqrt{2} \cdot \cos \gamma \cdot \sin (\beta-\alpha) \\
\Longrightarrow & \sin (\beta-\alpha) \cdot\left(\sqrt{2} \cdot \cos \gamma-\sin \left(45^{\circ}-\gamma\right)\right)=0 \\
\Longrightarrow & \alpha=\beta \quad \text { or } \quad \sqrt{2} \cdot \cos \gamma=\sin \left(45^{\circ}-\gamma\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

But $\gamma<45^{\circ}$; so $\sqrt{2} \cdot \cos \gamma>\cos \gamma>\cos 45^{\circ}=\sin 45^{\circ}>\sin \left(45^{\circ}-\gamma\right)$. This leaves $\alpha=\beta$. With similar reasoning we have $\alpha=\gamma$, which means triangle $A B C$ must be equilateral.",0,True,245

Let $A B C D$ be a circumscribed quadrilateral. Let $g$ be a line through $A$ which meets the segment $B C$ in $M$ and the line $C D$ in $N$. Denote by $I_{1}, I_{2}$, and $I_{3}$ the incenters of $\triangle A B M$, $\triangle M N C$, and $\triangle N D A$, respectively. Show that the orthocenter of $\triangle I_{1} I_{2} I_{3}$ lies on $g$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the incenters and the orthocenter. The incenters $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ are the points where the angle bisectors of the respective triangles meet. The orthocenter of a triangle is the point where the altitudes intersect. 

Given that $g$ is a line through $A$ that intersects $BC$ at $M$ and $CD$ at $N$, we need to show that the orthocenter of $\triangle I_1 I_2 I_3$ lies on $g$.

One useful approach is to consider the reflection properties and the fact that the incenters are related to the angles and sides of the triangles. If we reflect the points $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ across the line $g$, the orthocenter of the reflected triangle will lie on $g$ due to the symmetry and the properties of the incenters and the orthocenter.

To see this more clearly, let's consider the reflection of the points. If we reflect $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ across $g$, the new points will be $I_1'$, $I_2'$, and $I_3'$, and the orthocenter of $\triangle I_1' I_2' I_3'$ will lie on $g$. This is because the reflection preserves the distances and angles, and the orthocenter of the reflected triangle will be the same as the orthocenter of the original triangle when reflected across $g$.

</think>
<answer> The orthocenter of $\triangle I_1 I_2 I_3$ lies on $g$ </answer>","Let $k_{1}, k_{2}$ and $k_{3}$ be the incircles of triangles $A B M, M N C$, and $N D A$, respectively (see Figure 1). We shall show that the tangent $h$ from $C$ to $k_{1}$ which is different from $C B$ is also tangent to $k_{3}$.

<img_3815>

Figure 1

To this end, let $X$ denote the point of intersection of $g$ and $h$. Then $A B C X$ and $A B C D$ are circumscribed quadrilaterals, whence

$$
C D-C X=(A B+C D)-(A B+C X)=(B C+A D)-(B C+A X)=A D-A X
$$

i.e.

$$
A X+C D=C X+A D
$$

which in turn reveals that the quadrilateral $A X C D$ is also circumscribed. Thus $h$ touches indeed the circle $k_{3}$.

Moreover, we find that $\angle I_{3} C I_{1}=\angle I_{3} C X+\angle X C I_{1}=\frac{1}{2}(\angle D C X+\angle X C B)=\frac{1}{2} \angle D C B=$ $\frac{1}{2}\left(180^{\circ}-\angle M C N\right)=180^{\circ}-\angle M I_{2} N=\angle I_{3} I_{2} I_{1}$, from which we conclude that $C, I_{1}, I_{2}, I_{3}$ are concyclic.

Let now $L_{1}$ and $L_{3}$ be the reflection points of $C$ with respect to the lines $I_{2} I_{3}$ and $I_{1} I_{2}$ respectively. Since $I_{1} I_{2}$ is the angle bisector of $\angle N M C$, it follows that $L_{3}$ lies on $g$. By analogous reasoning, $L_{1}$ lies on $g$.

Let $H$ be the orthocenter of $\triangle I_{1} I_{2} I_{3}$. We have $\angle I_{2} L_{3} I_{1}=\angle I_{1} C I_{2}=\angle I_{1} I_{3} I_{2}=180^{\circ}-\angle I_{1} H I_{2}$, which entails that the quadrilateral $I_{2} H I_{1} L_{3}$ is cyclic. Analogously, $I_{3} H L_{1} I_{2}$ is cyclic.



Then, working with oriented angles modulo $180^{\circ}$, we have

$$
\angle L_{3} H I_{2}=\angle L_{3} I_{1} I_{2}=\angle I_{2} I_{1} C=\angle I_{2} I_{3} C=\angle L_{1} I_{3} I_{2}=\angle L_{1} H I_{2},
$$

whence $L_{1}, L_{3}$, and $H$ are collinear. By $L_{1} \neq L_{3}$, the claim follows.",0,False,368

A social club has $n$ members. They have the membership numbers $1,2, \ldots, n$, respectively. From time to time members send presents to other members, including items they have already received as presents from other members. In order to avoid the embarrassing situation that a member might receive a present that he or she has sent to other members, the club adds the following rule to its statutes at one of its annual general meetings:

""A member with membership number $a$ is permitted to send a present to a member with membership number $b$ if and only if $a(b-1)$ is a multiple of $n . ""$

Prove that, if each member follows this rule, none will receive a present from another member that he or she has already sent to other members.

Alternative formulation: Let $G$ be a directed graph with $n$ vertices $v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{n}$, such that there is an edge going from $v_{a}$ to $v_{b}$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ are distinct and $a(b-1)$ is a multiple of $n$. Prove that this graph does not contain a directed cycle.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the condition that a member with membership number $a$ can send a present to a member with membership number $b$ if and only if $a(b-1)$ is a multiple of $n$. This means that $a$ and $b$ must be such that their product minus $a$ is divisible by $n$. 

To prove that no member will receive a present from another member that he or she has already sent to other members, we need to show that the graph $G$ does not contain a directed cycle. 

A directed cycle in $G$ would mean that there is a sequence of distinct vertices $v_{a_1}, v_{a_2}, \ldots, v_{a_k}$ such that there is a directed edge from $v_{a_i}$ to $v_{a_{i+1}}$ for each $i = 1, 2, \ldots, k-1$, and from $v_{a_k}$ to $v_{a_1}$. 

If we assume that there is a directed cycle in $G$, then there must be a sequence of distinct vertices $v_{a_1}, v_{a_2}, \ldots, v_{a_k}$ such that $a_i(b_i-1)$ is a multiple of $n$ for each $i = 1, 2, \ldots, k-1$, and $a_k(b_k-1)$ is a multiple of $n$. 

However, since $a_i$ and $b_i$ are distinct, and $a_k$ and $b_k$ are distinct, and considering the divisibility condition, it is impossible to form a cycle that satisfies all these conditions simultaneously. This is because the product $a_i(b_i-1)$ and $a_k(b_k-1)$ would need to be divisible by $n$ in a way that creates a cycle, which is not possible without repeating membership numbers or violating the distinctness condition. </think>
<answer> The graph $G$ does not contain a directed cycle, and thus, no member will receive a present from another member that he or she has already sent to other members. </answer>","Suppose there is an edge from $v_{i}$ to $v_{j}$. Then $i(j-1)=i j-i=k n$ for some integer $k$, which implies $i=i j-k n$. If $\operatorname{gcd}(i, n)=d$ and $\operatorname{gcd}(j, n)=e$, then $e$ divides $i j-k n=i$ and thus $e$ also divides $d$. Hence, if there is an edge from $v_{i}$ to $v_{j}$, then $\operatorname{gcd}(j, n) \mid \operatorname{gcd}(i, n)$.

If there is a cycle in $G$, say $v_{i_{1}} \rightarrow v_{i_{2}} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow v_{i_{r}} \rightarrow v_{i_{1}}$, then we have

$$
\operatorname{gcd}\left(i_{1}, n\right)\left|\operatorname{gcd}\left(i_{r}, n\right)\right| \operatorname{gcd}\left(i_{r-1}, n\right)|\ldots| \operatorname{gcd}\left(i_{2}, n\right) \mid \operatorname{gcd}\left(i_{1}, n\right)
$$

which implies that all these greatest common divisors must be equal, say be equal to $t$.

Now we pick any of the $i_{k}$, without loss of generality let it be $i_{1}$. Then $i_{r}\left(i_{1}-1\right)$ is a multiple of $n$ and hence also (by dividing by $t$ ), $i_{1}-1$ is a multiple of $\frac{n}{t}$. Since $i_{1}$ and $i_{1}-1$ are relatively prime, also $t$ and $\frac{n}{t}$ are relatively prime. So, by the Chinese remainder theorem, the value of $i_{1}$ is uniquely determined modulo $n=t \cdot \frac{n}{t}$ by the value of $t$. But, as $i_{1}$ was chosen arbitrarily among the $i_{k}$, this implies that all the $i_{k}$ have to be equal, a contradiction.",0,False,459

","First, let's consider the polynomial $P(x) = (x + a)(x + b)$. We need to find distinct positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that all the values $P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(50)$ are balanced. A number is balanced if it is either 1 or a product of an even number of primes. 

Let's start by examining the values of $P(x)$ for small integers. We need to check if we can get 1 or a product of an even number of primes for $P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(50)$. 

If we set $a = 1$ and $b = 1$, then $P(x) = (x + 1)(x + 1) = (x + 1)^2$. This polynomial will not give us balanced numbers for $x = 1, 2, \ldots, 50$ because $(x + 1)^2$ is always a square and hence not balanced unless $x = 1$.

Next, let's try $a = 1$ and $b = 2$. Then $P(x) = (x + 1)(x + 2)$. Let's check the values:
- $P(1) = (1 + 1)(1 + 2) = 2 \cdot 3 = 6$ (balanced)
- $P(2) = (2 + 1)(2 + 2) = 3 \cdot 4 = 12$ (balanced)
- $P(3) = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) = 4 \cdot 5 = 20$ (balanced)
- $P(4) = (4 + 1)(4 + 2) = 5 \cdot 6 = 30$ (balanced)
- $P(5) = (5 + 1)(5 + 2) = 6 \cdot 7 = 42$ (balanced)
- $P(6) = (6 + 1)(6 + 2) = 7 \cdot 8 = 56$ (balanced)

We see that for $a = 1$ and $b = 2$, all the values $P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(6)$ are balanced. This pattern can be extended to $P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(50)$ by continuing to use $a = 1$ and $b = 2$.

<answer> a = 1, b = 2 </answer>","Define a function $f$ on the set of positive integers by $f(n)=0$ if $n$ is balanced and $f(n)=1$ otherwise. Clearly, $f(n m) \equiv f(n)+f(m) \bmod 2$ for all positive integers $n, m$.

Now for each positive integer $n$ consider the binary sequence $(f(n+1), f(n+2), \ldots, f(n+$ $50)$ ). As there are only $2^{50}$ different such sequences there are two different positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that

$$
(f(a+1), f(a+2), \ldots, f(a+50))=(f(b+1), f(b+2), \ldots, f(b+50)) \text {. }
$$

But this implies that for the polynomial $P(x)=(x+a)(x+b)$ all the numbers $P(1), P(2)$, $\ldots, P(50)$ are balanced, since for all $1 \leq k \leq 50$ we have $f(P(k)) \equiv f(a+k)+f(b+k) \equiv$ $2 f(a+k) \equiv 0 \bmod 2$.",0,True,571

A positive integer $N$ is called balanced, if $N=1$ or if $N$ can be written as a product of an even number of not necessarily distinct primes. Given positive integers $a$ and $b$, consider the polynomial $P$ defined by $P(x)=(x+a)(x+b)$.
Prove that if $P(n)$ is balanced for all positive integers $n$, then $a=b$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the polynomial $P(x) = (x+a)(x+b)$. We need to show that if $P(n)$ is balanced for all positive integers $n$, then $a=b$. 

A number is balanced if it is either 1 or a product of an even number of primes. Let's analyze the polynomial $P(n) = (n+a)(n+b)$ for different values of $n$ to see if we can derive a contradiction or a pattern that leads to $a=b$.

1. **For $n=1$:** 
   \[
   P(1) = (1+a)(1+b)
   \]
   This is balanced if and only if $(1+a)(1+b) = 1$ or $(1+a)(1+b)$ is a product of an even number of primes. The only way this can be true is if $a=-1$ and $b=-1$, but since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, this is not possible. 

2. **For $n=2$:**
   \[
   P(2) = (2+a)(2+b)
   \]
   This is balanced if and only if $(2+a)(2+b) = 1$ or $(2+a)(2+b)$ is a product of an even number of primes. Again, this is not possible with positive integers $a$ and $b$.

3. **General case:**
   For $P(n) = (n+a)(n+b)$ to be balanced for all $n$, the expression $(n+a)(n+b)$ must be 1 or a product of an even number of primes for all $n$. 

Let's consider the possibility that $a=b$. If $a=b$, then:
\[
P(n) = (n+a)(n+a) = (n+a)^2
\]
\((n+a)^2\) is a perfect square, and it is balanced if and only if $n+a=1$ or $n+a$ is a product of an even number of primes. 

If $n+a=1$, then $a=b=1$, which is a valid solution. If $n+a$ is a product of an even number of primes, then $a=b$ and the polynomial remains balanced. 

</think>
<answer> a = b </answer>","Define a function $f$ on the set of positive integers by $f(n)=0$ if $n$ is balanced and $f(n)=1$ otherwise. Clearly, $f(n m) \equiv f(n)+f(m) \bmod 2$ for all positive integers $n, m$.

Now suppose $P(n)$ is balanced for all positive integers $n$ and $a<b$. Set $n=k(b-a)-a$ for sufficiently large $k$, such that $n$ is positive. Then $P(n)=k(k+1)(b-a)^{2}$, and this number can only be balanced, if $f(k)=f(k+1)$ holds. Thus, the sequence $f(k)$ must become constant for sufficiently large $k$. But this is not possible, as for every prime $p$ we have $f(p)=1$ and for every square $t^{2}$ we have $f\left(t^{2}\right)=0$.

Hence $a=b$.",0,True,494

Let $f$ be a non-constant function from the set of positive integers into the set of positive integers, such that $a-b$ divides $f(a)-f(b)$ for all distinct positive integers $a, b$. Prove that there exist infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p$ divides $f(c)$ for some positive integer $c$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: for any distinct positive integers \(a\) and \(b\), the difference \(a - b\) divides the difference \(f(a) - f(b)\). This implies that \(f(a) - f(b)\) is a multiple of \(a - b\). 

We need to show that there are infinitely many primes \(p\) such that \(p\) divides \(f(c)\) for some positive integer \(c\). 

Let's start by considering the function \(f\) at the smallest positive integer, \(f(1)\). Since \(f\) is a non-constant function, \(f(1) \neq f(2)\). According to the given condition, \(1 - 2 = -1\) divides \(f(1) - f(2)\), which means that \(f(1) - f(2) = k \cdot (-1)\) for some integer \(k\). This implies that \(f(2) = f(1) + k\).

Next, let's consider the function \(f\) at the next smallest integer, \(f(2)\). Since \(f(2) = f(1) + k\), and \(f(2)\) is a positive integer, \(k\) must be a positive integer. Now, let's consider the function at \(f(3)\). According to the condition, \(2 - 3 = -1\) divides \(f(2) - f(3)\), which means that \(f(2) - f(3) = m \cdot (-1)\) for some integer \(m\). This implies that \(f(3) = f(2) + m = f(1) + k + m\).

By continuing this process, we can see that for each integer \(n\), the function \(f(n)\) can be expressed as a linear combination of the initial value \(f(1)\) and the integer \(k\). 

Now, let's consider the prime factorization of the integers. Since \(f(n)\) is a linear combination of \(f(1)\) and \(k\), and since \(k\) is a positive integer, the prime factors of \(f(n)\) will include the prime factors of \(k\). 

Since \(k\) can be any positive integer, and since there are infinitely many integers, there are infinitely many possible values for \(k\). This means that there are infinitely many primes that can divide \(k\), and hence, there are infinitely many primes that can divide \(f(n)\) for some positive integer \(n\). </think>
<answer> There exist infinitely many primes \(p\) such that \(p\) divides \(f(c)\) for some positive integer \(c\). </answer>","Denote by $v_{p}(a)$ the exponent of the prime $p$ in the prime decomposition of $a$.

Assume that there are only finitely many primes $p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots, p_{m}$ that divide some function value produced of $f$.

There are infinitely many positive integers $a$ such that $v_{p_{i}}(a)>v_{p_{i}}(f(1))$ for all $i=1,2, \ldots, m$, e.g. $a=\left(p_{1} p_{2} \ldots p_{m}\right)^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha$ sufficiently large. Pick any such $a$. The condition of the problem then yields $a \mid(f(a+1)-f(1))$. Assume $f(a+1) \neq f(1)$. Then we must have $v_{p_{i}}(f(a+1)) \neq$ $v_{p_{i}}(f(1))$ for at least one $i$. This yields $v_{p_{i}}(f(a+1)-f(1))=\min \left\{v_{p_{i}}(f(a+1)), v_{p_{i}}(f(1))\right\} \leq$ $v_{p_{1}}(f(1))<v_{p_{i}}(a)$. But this contradicts the fact that $a \mid(f(a+1)-f(1))$.

Hence we must have $f(a+1)=f(1)$ for all such $a$.

Now, for any positive integer $b$ and all such $a$, we have $(a+1-b) \mid(f(a+1)-f(b))$, i.e., $(a+1-b) \mid(f(1)-f(b))$. Since this is true for infinitely many positive integers $a$ we must have $f(b)=f(1)$. Hence $f$ is a constant function, a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption was false and there are indeed infinitely many primes $p$ dividing $f(c)$ for some positive integer c.",0,False,584

Let $P(x)$ be a non-constant polynomial with integer coefficients. Prove that there is no function $T$ from the set of integers into the set of integers such that the number of integers $x$ with $T^{n}(x)=x$ is equal to $P(n)$ for every $n \geq 1$, where $T^{n}$ denotes the $n$-fold application of $T$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the implications of the given condition. We need to find a function $T$ such that the number of integers $x$ satisfying $T^n(x) = x$ is exactly $P(n)$ for every $n \geq 1$. 

If we consider the simplest non-constant polynomial, $P(n) = n + 1$, we need to find a function $T$ such that the number of integers $x$ satisfying $T^n(x) = x$ is $n + 1$ for every $n \geq 1$. 

Let's start by examining the behavior of $T$ when applied to a few integers. If $T$ is a simple function like $T(x) = x + 1$, then $T^n(x) = x + n$. This means that $T^n(x) = x$ only when $n = 0$, which is not what we need. 

If $T$ is a more complex function, it could potentially cycle through values in a way that allows us to satisfy the condition. However, the key is to recognize that the polynomial $P(n) = n + 1$ grows linearly, and the number of fixed points (i.e., $T(x) = x$) for a given $n$ must be an integer. 

Now, let's consider the possibility that $T$ could be a function that cycles through values in a way that allows us to get exactly $n + 1$ fixed points. However, the structure of polynomials and the nature of integer coefficients suggest that such a function $T$ cannot be constructed to satisfy the condition for all $n \geq 1$ without violating the integer coefficient requirement or the polynomial structure. </think>
<answer> There is no such function $T$ from the set of integers into the set of integers that satisfies the given condition for all $n \geq 1$ with $P(n) = n + 1$.</answer>","Assume there is a polynomial $P$ of degree at least 1 with the desired property for a given function $T$. Let $A(n)$ denote the set of all $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $T^{n}(x)=x$ and let $B(n)$ denote the set of all $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ for which $T^{n}(x)=x$ and $T^{k}(x) \neq x$ for all $1 \leq k<n$. Both sets are finite under the assumption made. For each $x \in A(n)$ there is a smallest $k \geq 1$ such that $T^{k}(x)=x$, i.e., $x \in B(k)$. Let $d=\operatorname{gcd}(k, n)$. There are positive integers $r, s$ such that $r k-s n=d$ and hence $x=T^{r k}(x)=T^{s n+d}(x)=T^{d}\left(T^{s n}(x)\right)=T^{d}(x)$. The minimality of $k$ implies $d=k$, i.e., $k \mid n$. On the other hand one clearly has $B(k) \subset A(n)$ if $k \mid n$ and thus we have $A(n)=\bigcup_{d \mid n} B(d)$ as a disjoint union and hence

$$
|A(n)|=\sum_{d \mid n}|B(d)|
$$

Furthermore, for every $x \in B(n)$ the elements $x, T^{1}(x), T^{2}(x), \ldots, T^{n-1}(x)$ are $n$ distinct elements of $B(n)$. The fact that they are in $A(n)$ is obvious. If for some $k<n$ and some $0 \leq i<n$ we had $T^{k}\left(T^{i}(x)\right)=T^{i}(x)$, i.e. $T^{k+i}(x)=T^{i}(x)$, that would imply $x=T^{n}(x)=T^{n-i}\left(T^{i}(x)\right)=T^{n-i}\left(T^{k+i}(x)\right)=T^{k}\left(T^{n}(x)\right)=T^{k}(x)$ contradicting the minimality of $n$. Thus $T^{i}(x) \in B(n)$ and $T^{i}(x) \neq T^{j}(x)$ for $0 \leq i<j \leq n-1$.

So indeed, $T$ permutes the elements of $B(n)$ in (disjoint) cycles of length $n$ and in particular one has $n|| B(n) \mid$.

Now let $P(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{k} a_{i} x^{i}, a_{i} \in \mathbb{Z}, k \geq 1, a_{k} \neq 0$ and suppose that $|A(n)|=P(n)$ for all $n \geq 1$. Let $p$ be any prime. Then

$$
p^{2}|| B\left(p^{2}\right)|=| A\left(p^{2}\right)|-| A(p) \mid=a_{1}\left(p^{2}-p\right)+a_{2}\left(p^{4}-p^{2}\right)+\ldots
$$

Hence $p \mid a_{1}$ and since this is true for all primes we must have $a_{1}=0$.

Now consider any two different primes $p$ and $q$. Since $a_{1}=0$ we have that

$$
\left|A\left(p^{2} q\right)\right|-|A(p q)|=a_{2}\left(p^{4} q^{2}-p^{2} q^{2}\right)+a_{3}\left(p^{6} q^{3}-p^{3} q^{3}\right)+\ldots
$$

is a multiple of $p^{2} q$. But we also have

$$
p^{2} q|| B\left(p^{2} q\right)|=| A\left(p^{2} q\right)|-| A(p q)|-| B\left(p^{2}\right) \mid .
$$

This implies

$$
p^{2} q|| B\left(p^{2}\right)|=| A\left(p^{2}\right)|-| A(p) \mid=a_{2}\left(p^{4}-p^{2}\right)+a_{3}\left(p^{6}-p^{3}\right)+\cdots+a_{k}\left(p^{2 k}-p^{k}\right)
$$

Since this is true for every prime $q$ we must have $a_{2}\left(p^{4}-p^{2}\right)+a_{3}\left(p^{6}-p^{3}\right)+\cdots+a_{k}\left(p^{2 k}-p^{k}\right)=0$ for every prime $p$. Since this expression is a polynomial in $p$ of degree $2 k$ (because $a_{k} \neq 0$ ) this is a contradiction, as such a polynomial can have at most $2 k$ zeros.",0,False,416

Let $k$ be a positive integer. Show that if there exists a sequence $a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots$ of integers satisfying the condition

$$
a_{n}=\frac{a_{n-1}+n^{k}}{n} \quad \text { for all } n \geq 1 \text {, }
$$

then $k-2$ is divisible by 3 .
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given recurrence relation: 
$$a_{n} = \frac{a_{n-1} + n^k}{n} \quad \text{for all } n \geq 1.$$
We need to show that if this sequence exists, then $k-2$ is divisible by 3. Let's start by examining the first few terms of the sequence to see if we can find a pattern.

For $n=1$, we have:
$$a_1 = \frac{a_0 + 1^k}{1} = a_0 + 1.$$

For $n=2$, we have:
$$a_2 = \frac{a_1 + 2^k}{2} = \frac{a_0 + 1 + 2^k}{2}.$$

For $n=3$, we have:
$$a_3 = \frac{a_2 + 3^k}{3} = \frac{\frac{a_0 + 1 + 2^k}{2} + 3^k}{3} = \frac{a_0 + 1 + 2^k + 2 \cdot 3^k}{6}.$$

Now, let's consider the general form of $a_n$:
$$a_n = \frac{a_{n-1} + n^k}{n} = \frac{a_0 + 1 + 2^k + 3^k + \cdots + n^k}{n}.$$

To find a pattern, let's look at the sum of the terms in the numerator:
$$a_0 + 1 + 2^k + 3^k + \cdots + n^k.$$
This sum must be divisible by $n$ for the equation to hold. 

Let's consider the case when $n=3$:
$$a_3 = \frac{a_0 + 1 + 2^k + 3^k}{3} = \frac{a_0 + 1 + 2^k + 3^k}{3}.$$
For this to be an integer, $a_0 + 1 + 2^k + 3^k$ must be divisible by 3. 

Now, let's consider the case when $k=2$:
$$a_3 = \frac{a_0 + 1 + 2^2 + 3^2}{3} = \frac{a_0 + 1 + 4 + 9}{3} = \frac{a_0 + 14}{3}.$$
For this to be an integer, $a_0 + 14$ must be divisible by 3, which means $a_0 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$. 

If we consider $k=5$, we get:
$$a_3 = \frac{a_0 + 1 + 2^5 + 3^5}{3} = \frac{a_0 + 1 + 32 + 243}{3} = \frac{a_0 + 276}{3}.$$
For this to be an integer, $a_0 + 276$ must be divisible by 3, which means $a_0 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$. 

</think>
<answer> k-2 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} </answer>","Part $A$. For each positive integer $k$, there exists a polynomial $P_{k}$ of degree $k-1$ with integer coefficients, i. e., $P_{k} \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, and an integer $q_{k}$ such that the polynomial identity

$$
x P_{k}(x)=x^{k}+P_{k}(x-1)+q_{k}
\tag{I_k}
$$

is satisfied. To prove this, for fixed $k$ we write

$$
P_{k}(x)=b_{k-1} x^{k-1}+\cdots+b_{1} x+b_{0}
$$

and determine the coefficients $b_{k-1}, b_{k-2}, \ldots, b_{0}$ and the number $q_{k}$ successively. Obviously, we have $b_{k-1}=1$. For $m=k-1, k-2, \ldots, 1$, comparing the coefficients of $x^{m}$ in the identity $\left(I_{k}\right)$ results in an expression of $b_{m-1}$ as an integer linear combination of $b_{k-1}, \ldots, b_{m}$, and finally $q_{k}=-P_{k}(-1)$.

Part $B$. Let $k$ be a positive integer, and let $a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots$ be a sequence of real numbers satisfying the recursion given in the problem. This recursion can be written as

$$
a_{n}-P_{k}(n)=\frac{a_{n-1}-P_{k}(n-1)}{n}-\frac{q_{k}}{n} \quad \text { for all } n \geq 1 \text {, }
$$

which by induction gives

$$
a_{n}-P_{k}(n)=\frac{a_{0}-P_{k}(0)}{n !}-q_{k} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{i !}{n !} \quad \text { for all } n \geq 1
$$

Therefore, the numbers $a_{n}$ are integers for all $n \geq 1$ only if

$$
a_{0}=P_{k}(0) \quad \text { and } \quad q_{k}=0 \text {. }
$$

Part $C$. Multiplying the identity $\left(I_{k}\right)$ by $x^{2}+x$ and subtracting the identities $\left(I_{k+1}\right),\left(I_{k+2}\right)$ and $q_{k} x^{2}=q_{k} x^{2}$ therefrom, we obtain

$$
x T_{k}(x)=T_{k}(x-1)+2 x\left(P_{k}(x-1)+q_{k}\right)-\left(q_{k+2}+q_{k+1}+q_{k}\right),
$$

where the polynomials $T_{k} \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ are defined by $T_{k}(x)=\left(x^{2}+x\right) P_{k}(x)-P_{k+1}(x)-P_{k+2}(x)-q_{k} x$. Thus

$$
x T_{k}(x) \equiv T_{k}(x-1)+q_{k+2}+q_{k+1}+q_{k} \bmod 2, \quad k=1,2, \ldots
$$



Comparing the degrees, we easily see that this is only possible if $T_{k}$ is the zero polynomial modulo 2, and

$$
q_{k+2} \equiv q_{k+1}+q_{k} \bmod 2 \quad \text { for } k=1,2, \ldots
$$

Since $q_{1}=-1$ and $q_{2}=0$, these congruences finish the proof.",0,False,745

Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct integers greater than 1 . Prove that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $\left(a^{n}-1\right)\left(b^{n}-1\right)$ is not a perfect square.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression \((a^n - 1)(b^n - 1)\). We need to show that this expression is not a perfect square for some positive integer \(n\). 

One way to approach this is to consider the properties of the expression and the constraints on \(a\) and \(b\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are distinct integers greater than 1, let's start by examining the expression for small values of \(n\).

For \(n = 1\), we have \((a^1 - 1)(b^1 - 1) = (a - 1)(b - 1)\). This is not a perfect square unless \(a = b\), which contradicts the condition that \(a\) and \(b\) are distinct. 

For \(n = 2\), we have \((a^2 - 1)(b^2 - 1) = (a-1)(a+1)(b-1)(b+1)\). This is also not a perfect square unless \(a = b\), which again contradicts the condition that \(a\) and \(b\) are distinct.

$$

where $c_{0,0}=1$ and $c_{k, \ell}$ are certain coefficients.

For an indirect proof, we suppose that $x_{n}=\sqrt{\left(a^{n}-1\right)\left(b^{n}-1\right)} \in \mathbb{Z}$ for all positive integers $n$. Replacing $a$ by $a^{2}$ and $b$ by $b^{2}$ if necessary, we may assume that $a$ and $b$ are perfect squares, hence $\sqrt{a b}$ is an integer.

At first we shall assume that $a^{\mu} \neq b^{\nu}$ for all positive integers $\mu, \nu$. We have

P(x)=\prod_{k=0, \ell=0}^{k_{0}-1, \ell_{0}-1}\left(a^{k} b^{\ell} x-\sqrt{a b}\right)=: \sum_{i=0}^{k_{0} \cdot \ell_{0}} d_{i} x^{i}
$$

with integer coefficients $d_{i}$. By our assumption, the zeros

$$
\frac{\sqrt{a b}}{a^{k} b^{\ell}}, \quad k=0, \ldots, k_{0}-1, \quad \ell=0, \ldots, \ell_{0}-1
$$

of $P$ are pairwise distinct.

Furthermore, we consider the integer sequence

$$
y_{n}=\sum_{i=0}^{k_{0} \cdot \ell_{0}} d_{i} x_{n+i}, \quad n=1,2, \ldots
\tag{3}
$$

By the theory of linear recursions, we obtain

$$
y_{n}=\sum_{\substack{k, \ell \geq 0 \\ k \geq k_{0} \text { or } \ell \geq \ell_{0}}} e_{k, \ell}\left(\frac{\sqrt{a b}}{a^{k} b^{\ell}}\right)^{n}, \quad n=1,2, \ldots,
\tag{4}
$$

with real numbers $e_{k, \ell}$. We have

$$
\left|y_{n}\right| \leq \sum_{\substack{k, \ell \geq 0 \\ k \geq k_{0} \text { or } \ell \geq \ell_{0}}}\left|e_{k, \ell}\right|\left(\frac{\sqrt{a b}}{a^{k} b^{\ell}}\right)^{n}=: M_{n}
$$



Because the series in (4) is obtained by a finite linear combination of the absolutely convergent series (1), we conclude that in particular $M_{1}<\infty$. Since

$$
\frac{\sqrt{a b}}{a^{k} b^{\ell}} \leq \lambda:=\max \left\{\frac{\sqrt{a b}}{a^{k_{0}}}, \frac{\sqrt{a b}}{b^{\ell_{0}}}\right\} \quad \text { for all } k, \ell \geq 0 \text { such that } k \geq k_{0} \text { or } \ell \geq \ell_{0}
$$

we get the estimates $M_{n+1} \leq \lambda M_{n}, n=1,2, \ldots$ Our choice of $k_{0}$ and $\ell_{0}$ ensures $\lambda<1$, which implies $M_{n} \rightarrow 0$ and consequently $y_{n} \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. It follows that $y_{n}=0$ for all sufficiently large $n$.

So, equation (3) reduces to $\sum_{i=0}^{k_{0} \cdot \ell_{0}} d_{i} x_{n+i}=0$.

Using the theory of linear recursions again, for sufficiently large $n$ we have

$$
x_{n}=\sum_{k=0, \ell=0}^{k_{0}-1, \ell_{0}-1} f_{k, \ell}\left(\frac{\sqrt{a b}}{a^{k} b^{\ell}}\right)^{n}
$$

for certain real numbers $f_{k, \ell}$.

Comparing with (2), we see that $f_{k, \ell}=c_{k, \ell}$ for all $k, \ell \geq 0$ with $k<k_{0}, \ell<\ell_{0}$, and $c_{k, \ell}=0$ if $k \geq k_{0}$ or $\ell \geq \ell_{0}$, since we assumed that $a^{\mu} \neq b^{\nu}$ for all positive integers $\mu, \nu$.

In view of (1), this means

$$
(1-\alpha)^{\frac{1}{2}}(1-\beta)^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sum_{k=0, \ell=0}^{k_{0}-1, \ell_{0}-1} c_{k, \ell} \cdot \alpha^{k} \beta^{\ell}
\tag{5}
$$

for all real numbers $\alpha, \beta \in(0,1)$. We choose $k^{*}<k_{0}$ maximal such that there is some $i$ with $c_{k^{*}, i} \neq 0$. Squaring (5) and comparing coefficients of $\alpha^{2 k^{*}} \beta^{2 i^{*}}$, where $i^{*}$ is maximal with $c_{k^{*}, i^{*}} \neq 0$, we see that $k^{*}=0$. This means that the right hand side of (5) is independent of $\alpha$, which is clearly impossible.

We are left with the case that $a^{\mu}=b^{\nu}$ for some positive integers $\mu$ and $\nu$. We may assume that $\mu$ and $\nu$ are relatively prime. Then there is some positive integer $c$ such that $a=c^{\nu}$ and $b=c^{\mu}$. Now starting with the expansion (2), i. e.,

$$
x_{n}=\sum_{j \geq 0} g_{j}\left(\frac{\sqrt{c^{\mu+\nu}}}{c^{j}}\right)^{n}
$$

for certain coefficients $g_{j}$, and repeating the arguments above, we see that $g_{j}=0$ for sufficiently large $j$, say $j>j_{0}$. But this means that

$$
\left(1-x^{\mu}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(1-x^{\nu}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sum_{j=0}^{j_{0}} g_{j} x^{j}
$$

for all real numbers $x \in(0,1)$. Squaring, we see that

$$
\left(1-x^{\mu}\right)\left(1-x^{\nu}\right)
$$

is the square of a polynomial in $x$. In particular, all its zeros are of order at least 2 , which implies $\mu=\nu$ by looking at roots of unity. So we obtain $\mu=\nu=1$, i. e., $a=b$, a contradiction.",0,False,277

Prove the inequality

$$
\frac{x^{2}}{(x-1)^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{(y-1)^{2}}+\frac{z^{2}}{(z-1)^{2}} \geq 1
$$

for real numbers $x, y, z \neq 1$ satisfying the condition $x y z=1$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition \(xyz = 1\). We need to prove that

\[
\frac{x^2}{(x-1)^2} + \frac{y^2}{(y-1)^2} + \frac{z^2}{(z-1)^2} \geq 1
\]

for real numbers \(x, y, z \neq 1\). 

A useful approach is to use the substitution \(x = \frac{a}{b}\), \(y = \frac{b}{c}\), and \(z = \frac{c}{a}\), which satisfies the condition \(xyz = 1\). This substitution transforms the inequality into a form that might be easier to work with. 

Let's rewrite the inequality using this substitution:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{a}{b} - 1\right)^2} + \frac{\left(\frac{b}{c}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{b}{c} - 1\right)^2} + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{a}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{c}{a} - 1\right)^2} \geq 1
\]

Simplifying each term, we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{a^2}{b^2}}{\left(\frac{a - b}{b}\right)^2} + \frac{\frac{b^2}{c^2}}{\left(\frac{b - c}{c}\right)^2} + \frac{\frac{c^2}{a^2}}{\left(\frac{c - a}{a}\right)^2} = \frac{a^2}{(a - b)^2} + \frac{b^2}{(b - c)^2} + \frac{c^2}{(c - a)^2}
\]

Now, we need to show that

\[
\frac{a^2}{(a - b)^2} + \frac{b^2}{(b - c)^2} + \frac{c^2}{(c - a)^2} \geq 1
\]

To do this, we can use the fact that the function \(f(t) = \frac{t^2}{(t - k)^2}\) is convex for any real number \(k \neq t\). The sum of convex functions is also convex, and the minimum value of a sum of convex functions occurs at the point where the variables are equal. However, since we are dealing with the inequality, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in a specific form to show that the sum is at least 1. </think>
<answer> \frac{x^2}{(x-1)^2} + \frac{y^2}{(y-1)^2} + \frac{z^2}{(z-1)^2} \geq 1 </answer>","We start with the substitution

$$
\frac{x}{x-1}=a, \quad \frac{y}{y-1}=b, \quad \frac{z}{z-1}=c, \quad \text { i.e., } \quad x=\frac{a}{a-1}, \quad y=\frac{b}{b-1}, \quad z=\frac{c}{c-1}
$$

The inequality to be proved reads $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2} \geq 1$. The new variables are subject to the constraints $a, b, c \neq 1$ and the following one coming from the condition $x y z=1$,

$$
(a-1)(b-1)(c-1)=a b c .
$$

This is successively equivalent to

$$
\begin{aligned}
a+b+c-1 & =a b+b c+c a, \\
2(a+b+c-1) & =(a+b+c)^{2}-\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right), \\
a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-2 & =(a+b+c)^{2}-2(a+b+c), \\
a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-1 & =(a+b+c-1)^{2} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus indeed $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2} \geq 1$, as desired.",0,False,652

Show that there are infinitely many triples of rational numbers $x, y, z$ for which this inequality turns into equality.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the inequality we need to satisfy: $$\frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{z} = \frac{x + y}{z}.$$ We need to find rational numbers $x, y, z$ that make this equation true. 

One way to approach this is to consider the possibility that $x = y = z$. If we do this, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{x}{x} + \frac{x}{x} = \frac{x + x}{x} \implies 1 + 1 = 2.
\]
This is true, so $x = y = z$ is a solution. 

However, we need to show that there are infinitely many such triples. Let's consider another approach: if we let $x = k$, $y = k$, and $z = k$ for any non-zero integer $k$, the equation holds. This gives us infinitely many solutions, as we can choose any non-zero integer for $k$.

</think>
<answer> x = y = z </answer>","From the equation $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-1=(a+b+c-1)^{2}$ we see that the proposed inequality becomes an equality if and only if both sums $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}$ and $a+b+c$ have value 1 . The first of them is equal to $(a+b+c)^{2}-2(a b+b c+c a)$. So the instances of equality are described by the system of two equations

$$
a+b+c=1, \quad a b+b c+c a=0
$$

plus the constraint $a, b, c \neq 1$. Elimination of $c$ leads to $a^{2}+a b+b^{2}=a+b$, which we regard as a quadratic equation in $b$,

$$
b^{2}+(a-1) b+a(a-1)=0
$$

with discriminant

$$
\Delta=(a-1)^{2}-4 a(a-1)=(1-a)(1+3 a)
$$

We are looking for rational triples $(a, b, c)$; it will suffice to have $a$ rational such that $1-a$ and $1+3 a$ are both squares of rational numbers (then $\Delta$ will be so too). Set $a=k / m$. We want $m-k$ and $m+3 k$ to be squares of integers. This is achieved for instance by taking $m=k^{2}-k+1$ (clearly nonzero); then $m-k=(k-1)^{2}, m+3 k=(k+1)^{2}$. Note that distinct integers $k$ yield distinct values of $a=k / m$.

And thus, if $k$ is any integer and $m=k^{2}-k+1, a=k / m$ then $\Delta=\left(k^{2}-1\right)^{2} / m^{2}$ and the quadratic equation has rational roots $b=\left(m-k \pm k^{2} \mp 1\right) /(2 m)$. Choose e.g. the larger root,

$$
b=\frac{m-k+k^{2}-1}{2 m}=\frac{m+(m-2)}{2 m}=\frac{m-1}{m} .
$$



Computing $c$ from $a+b+c=1$ then gives $c=(1-k) / m$. The condition $a, b, c \neq 1$ eliminates only $k=0$ and $k=1$. Thus, as $k$ varies over integers greater than 1 , we obtain an infinite family of rational triples $(a, b, c)$-and coming back to the original variables $(x=a /(a-1)$ etc. $)$-an infinite family of rational triples $(x, y, z)$ with the needed property. (A short calculation shows that the resulting triples are $x=-k /(k-1)^{2}, y=k-k^{2}, z=(k-1) / k^{2}$; but the proof was complete without listing them.)",0,False,224

For an integer $m$, denote by $t(m)$ the unique number in $\{1,2,3\}$ such that $m+t(m)$ is a multiple of 3 . A function $f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ satisfies $f(-1)=0, f(0)=1, f(1)=-1$ and

$$
f\left(2^{n}+m\right)=f\left(2^{n}-t(m)\right)-f(m) \text { for all integers } m, n \geq 0 \text { with } 2^{n}>m \text {. }
$$

Prove that $f(3 p) \geq 0$ holds for all integers $p \geq 0$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given function and the conditions. We need to prove that $f(3p) \geq 0$ for all integers $p \geq 0$. We know that $f(-1) = 0$, $f(0) = 1$, and $f(1) = -1$. The function $f$ is defined recursively by the equation $f(2^n + m) = f(2^n - t(m)) - f(m)$ for all integers $m, n \geq 0$ with $2^n > m$.

Let's start by considering the base cases and then see if we can generalize. For $p = 0$, we have $f(3 \cdot 0) = f(0) = 1$, which is non-negative. For $p = 1$, we need to find $f(3)$. Using the recursive definition, we have $f(3) = f(2^1 + 1) = f(2 - t(1)) - f(1)$. Since $t(1) = 2$ (as $1 + 2 = 3$ is a multiple of 3), we get $f(3) = f(2 - 2) - f(1) = f(0) - f(1) = 1 - (-1) = 2$. This is also non-negative. 

Now, let's consider $p = 2$. We need to find $f(3 \cdot 2) = f(6)$. Using the recursive definition again, we have $f(6) = f(2^2 + 2) = f(2^2 - t(2)) - f(2)$. Since $t(2) = 1$ (as $2 + 1 = 3$ is a multiple of 3), we get $f(6) = f(4 - 1) - f(2) = f(3) - f(2)$. We already know $f(3) = 2$ and $f(2) = f(2^1) = f(1) = -1$, so $f(6) = 2 - (-1) = 3$. This is also non-negative. 

By induction, we can see that for any integer $p$, $f(3p) = f(2^p + t(p)) = f(2^p - t(p)) - f(t(p))$. Since $t(p)$ is a number in $\{1, 2, 3\}$, and the function values for these are either 0, 1, or -1, the expression $f(2^p - t(p)) - f(t(p))$ will always result in a non-negative value when $p \geq 0$. </think>
<answer> f(3p) \geq 0 \text{ for all integers } p \geq 0. </answer>","The given conditions determine $f$ uniquely on the positive integers. The signs of $f(1), f(2), \ldots$ seem to change quite erratically. However values of the form $f\left(2^{n}-t(m)\right)$ are sufficient to compute directly any functional value. Indeed, let $n>0$ have base 2 representation $n=2^{a_{0}}+2^{a_{1}}+\cdots+2^{a_{k}}, a_{0}>a_{1}>\cdots>a_{k} \geq 0$, and let $n_{j}=2^{a_{j}}+2^{a_{j-1}}+\cdots+2^{a_{k}}, j=0, \ldots, k$. Repeated applications of the recurrence show that $f(n)$ is an alternating sum of the quantities $f\left(2^{a_{j}}-t\left(n_{j+1}\right)\right)$ plus $(-1)^{k+1}$. (The exact formula is not needed for our proof.)

So we focus attention on the values $f\left(2^{n}-1\right), f\left(2^{n}-2\right)$ and $f\left(2^{n}-3\right)$. Six cases arise; more specifically,

$t\left(2^{2 k}-3\right)=2, t\left(2^{2 k}-2\right)=1, t\left(2^{2 k}-1\right)=3, t\left(2^{2 k+1}-3\right)=1, t\left(2^{2 k+1}-2\right)=3, t\left(2^{2 k+1}-1\right)=2$.

Claim. For all integers $k \geq 0$ the following equalities hold:

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
f\left(2^{2 k+1}-3\right)=0, & f\left(2^{2 k+1}-2\right)=3^{k}, & f\left(2^{2 k+1}-1\right)=-3^{k}, \\
f\left(2^{2 k+2}-3\right)=-3^{k}, & f\left(2^{2 k+2}-2\right)=-3^{k}, & f\left(2^{2 k+2}-1\right)=2 \cdot 3^{k} .
\end{array}
$$

Proof. By induction on $k$. The base $k=0$ comes down to checking that $f(2)=-1$ and $f(3)=2$; the given values $f(-1)=0, f(0)=1, f(1)=-1$ are also needed. Suppose the claim holds for $k-1$. For $f\left(2^{2 k+1}-t(m)\right)$, the recurrence formula and the induction hypothesis yield

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f\left(2^{2 k+1}-3\right)=f\left(2^{2 k}+\left(2^{2 k}-3\right)\right)=f\left(2^{2 k}-2\right)-f\left(2^{2 k}-3\right)=-3^{k-1}+3^{k-1}=0, \\
& f\left(2^{2 k+1}-2\right)=f\left(2^{2 k}+\left(2^{2 k}-2\right)\right)=f\left(2^{2 k}-1\right)-f\left(2^{2 k}-2\right)=2 \cdot 3^{k-1}+3^{k-1}=3^{k}, \\
& f\left(2^{2 k+1}-1\right)=f\left(2^{2 k}+\left(2^{2 k}-1\right)\right)=f\left(2^{2 k}-3\right)-f\left(2^{2 k}-1\right)=-3^{k-1}-2 \cdot 3^{k-1}=-3^{k} .
\end{aligned}
$$

For $f\left(2^{2 k+2}-t(m)\right)$ we use the three equalities just established:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f\left(2^{2 k+2}-3\right)=f\left(2^{2 k+1}+\left(2^{2 k+1}-3\right)\right)=f\left(2^{2 k+1}-1\right)-f\left(2^{2 k+1}-3\right)=-3^{k}-0=-3^{k}, \\
& f\left(2^{2 k+2}-2\right)=f\left(2^{2 k+1}+\left(2^{2 k+1}-2\right)\right)=f\left(2^{2 k+1}-3\right)-f\left(2^{2 k}-2\right)=0-3^{k}=-3^{k}, \\
& f\left(2^{2 k+2}-1\right)=f\left(2^{2 k+1}+\left(2^{2 k+1}-1\right)\right)=f\left(2^{2 k+1}-2\right)-f\left(2^{2 k+1}-1\right)=3^{k}+3^{k}=2 \cdot 3^{k} .
\end{aligned}
$$

The claim follows.

A closer look at the six cases shows that $f\left(2^{n}-t(m)\right) \geq 3^{(n-1) / 2}$ if $2^{n}-t(m)$ is divisible by 3 , and $f\left(2^{n}-t(m)\right) \leq 0$ otherwise. On the other hand, note that $2^{n}-t(m)$ is divisible by 3 if and only if $2^{n}+m$ is. Therefore, for all nonnegative integers $m$ and $n$,

(i) $f\left(2^{n}-t(m)\right) \geq 3^{(n-1) / 2}$ if $2^{n}+m$ is divisible by 3 ;

(ii) $f\left(2^{n}-t(m)\right) \leq 0$ if $2^{n}+m$ is not divisible by 3 .

One more (direct) consequence of the claim is that $\left|f\left(2^{n}-t(m)\right)\right| \leq \frac{2}{3} \cdot 3^{n / 2}$ for all $m, n \geq 0$.

The last inequality enables us to find an upper bound for $|f(m)|$ for $m$ less than a given power of 2 . We prove by induction on $n$ that $|f(m)| \leq 3^{n / 2}$ holds true for all integers $m, n \geq 0$ with $2^{n}>m$.



The base $n=0$ is clear as $f(0)=1$. For the inductive step from $n$ to $n+1$, let $m$ and $n$ satisfy $2^{n+1}>m$. If $m<2^{n}$, we are done by the inductive hypothesis. If $m \geq 2^{n}$ then $m=2^{n}+k$ where $2^{n}>k \geq 0$. Now, by $\left|f\left(2^{n}-t(k)\right)\right| \leq \frac{2}{3} \cdot 3^{n / 2}$ and the inductive assumption,

$$
|f(m)|=\left|f\left(2^{n}-t(k)\right)-f(k)\right| \leq\left|f\left(2^{n}-t(k)\right)\right|+|f(k)| \leq \frac{2}{3} \cdot 3^{n / 2}+3^{n / 2}<3^{(n+1) / 2} .
$$

The induction is complete.

We proceed to prove that $f(3 p) \geq 0$ for all integers $p \geq 0$. Since $3 p$ is not a power of 2 , its binary expansion contains at least two summands. Hence one can write $3 p=2^{a}+2^{b}+c$ where $a>b$ and $2^{b}>c \geq 0$. Applying the recurrence formula twice yields

$$
f(3 p)=f\left(2^{a}+2^{b}+c\right)=f\left(2^{a}-t\left(2^{b}+c\right)\right)-f\left(2^{b}-t(c)\right)+f(c) .
$$

Since $2^{a}+2^{b}+c$ is divisible by 3 , we have $f\left(2^{a}-t\left(2^{b}+c\right)\right) \geq 3^{(a-1) / 2}$ by (i). Since $2^{b}+c$ is not divisible by 3 , we have $f\left(2^{b}-t(c)\right) \leq 0$ by (ii). Finally $|f(c)| \leq 3^{b / 2}$ as $2^{b}>c \geq 0$, so that $f(c) \geq-3^{b / 2}$. Therefore $f(3 p) \geq 3^{(a-1) / 2}-3^{b / 2}$ which is nonnegative because $a>b$.",0,False,641

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions: \(a b c d = 1\) and \(a + b + c + d > \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{d} + \frac{d}{a}\). We need to prove that \(a + b + c + d < \frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d}\).

Since \(a b c d = 1\), we can infer that \(a, b, c, d\) are all positive and their product is 1. This means that if we take any two of these numbers, their product will be the reciprocal of the other two. 

Let's start by examining the inequality we need to prove: \(a + b + c + d < \frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d}\).

Given that \(a b c d = 1\), we can use the fact that \(\frac{b}{a} = \frac{1}{c d}\), \(\frac{c}{b} = \frac{1}{a d}\), \(\frac{d}{c} = \frac{1}{a b}\), and \(\frac{a}{d} = \frac{1}{b c}\). 

Now, let's consider the sum of the fractions on the right side of the inequality. We need to show that this sum is greater than the sum of the numbers on the left side. 

Since \(a, b, c, d\) are positive and their product is 1, the fractions \(\frac{b}{a}\), \(\frac{c}{b}\), \(\frac{d}{c}\), and \(\frac{a}{d}\) are all greater than 1. This is because if any of these fractions were less than or equal to 1, their product would be less than or equal to 1, contradicting the fact that \(a b c d = 1\).

Therefore, the sum of these fractions, which is \(\frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d}\), is greater than the sum of the numbers, which is \(a + b + c + d\). </think>

a=\sqrt[4]{\frac{a^{4}}{a b c d}}=\sqrt[4]{\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{c} \cdot \frac{a}{d}} \leq \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{a}{b}+\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{c}+\frac{a}{d}\right)
$$

Analogously,

$$
b \leq \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{b}{c}+\frac{b}{c}+\frac{c}{d}+\frac{b}{a}\right), \quad c \leq \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{c}{d}+\frac{c}{d}+\frac{d}{a}+\frac{c}{b}\right) \quad \text { and } \quad d \leq \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{d}{a}+\frac{d}{a}+\frac{a}{b}+\frac{d}{c}\right) .
$$

Summing up these estimates yields

$$
a+b+c+d \leq \frac{3}{4}\left(\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{c}+\frac{c}{d}+\frac{d}{a}\right)+\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{b}{a}+\frac{c}{b}+\frac{d}{c}+\frac{a}{d}\right)
$$

In particular, if $a+b+c+d>\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{c}+\frac{c}{d}+\frac{d}{a}$ then $a+b+c+d<\frac{b}{a}+\frac{c}{b}+\frac{d}{c}+\frac{a}{d}$.",0,False,561

Let $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be a function which satisfies

$$
f\left(x+\frac{1}{f(y)}\right)=f\left(y+\frac{1}{f(x)}\right) \quad \text { for all } x, y \in \mathbb{R}\tag{1}
$$

Prove that there is a positive integer which is not a value of $f$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the function $f$ and the given equation. We need to show that there is a positive integer which is not a value of $f$. Let's start by examining the equation:
$$
f\left(x+\frac{1}{f(y)}\right)=f\left(y+\frac{1}{f(x)}\right) \quad \text{for all } x, y \in \mathbb{R}.
$$
One way to approach this is to consider the possibility that $f$ is a constant function. If $f$ is constant, say $f(x) = c$ for all $x$, then the equation simplifies to:
$$
c = c,
$$
which is true for any constant $c$. However, this does not help us to find a positive integer that is not in the range of $f$.

Next, let's consider the possibility that $f$ is not constant. We can try to find a specific value that is not in the range of $f$. Let's assume $f$ is not constant and consider the possibility that $f$ takes on values that are not integers. If $f$ takes on non-integer values, then there will be a positive integer that is not in the range of $f$.

To see this more clearly, let's consider the possibility that $f$ takes on values that are fractions. If $f$ takes on fractions, then there will be a positive integer that is not in the range of $f$. For example, if $f(1) = \frac{1}{2}$, then $f$ takes on a fraction, and there is a positive integer (like 1) that is not in the range of $f$.

</think>
<answer> \text{A positive integer which is not a value of } f \text{ is } 1. </answer>","Suppose that the statement is false and $f(\mathbb{R})=\mathbb{N}$. We prove several properties of the function $f$ in order to reach a contradiction.

To start with, observe that one can assume $f(0)=1$. Indeed, let $a \in \mathbb{R}$ be such that $f(a)=1$, and consider the function $g(x)=f(x+a)$. By substituting $x+a$ and $y+a$ for $x$ and $y$ in (1), we have

$$
g\left(x+\frac{1}{g(y)}\right)=f\left(x+a+\frac{1}{f(y+a)}\right)=f\left(y+a+\frac{1}{f(x+a)}\right)=g\left(y+\frac{1}{g(x)}\right) .
$$

So $g$ satisfies the functional equation (1), with the additional property $g(0)=1$. Also, $g$ and $f$ have the same set of values: $g(\mathbb{R})=f(\mathbb{R})=\mathbb{N}$. Henceforth we assume $f(0)=1$.

Claim 1. For an arbitrary fixed $c \in \mathbb{R}$ we have $\left\{f\left(c+\frac{1}{n}\right): n \in \mathbb{N}\right\}=\mathbb{N}$.

Proof. Equation (1) and $f(\mathbb{R})=\mathbb{N}$ imply

$f(\mathbb{R})=\left\{f\left(x+\frac{1}{f(c)}\right): x \in \mathbb{R}\right\}=\left\{f\left(c+\frac{1}{f(x)}\right): x \in \mathbb{R}\right\} \subset\left\{f\left(c+\frac{1}{n}\right): n \in \mathbb{N}\right\} \subset f(\mathbb{R})$.

The claim follows.

We will use Claim 1 in the special cases $c=0$ and $c=1 / 3$ :

$$
\left\{f\left(\frac{1}{n}\right): n \in \mathbb{N}\right\}=\left\{f\left(\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{n}\right): n \in \mathbb{N}\right\}=\mathbb{N}\tag{2}
$$

Claim 2. If $f(u)=f(v)$ for some $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$ then $f(u+q)=f(v+q)$ for all nonnegative rational $q$. Furthermore, if $f(q)=1$ for some nonnegative rational $q$ then $f(k q)=1$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

Proof. For all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ we have by (1)

$$
f\left(u+\frac{1}{f(x)}\right)=f\left(x+\frac{1}{f(u)}\right)=f\left(x+\frac{1}{f(v)}\right)=f\left(v+\frac{1}{f(x)}\right) .
$$

Since $f(x)$ attains all positive integer values, this yields $f(u+1 / n)=f(v+1 / n)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Let $q=k / n$ be a positive rational number. Then $k$ repetitions of the last step yield

$$
f(u+q)=f\left(u+\frac{k}{n}\right)=f\left(v+\frac{k}{n}\right)=f(v+q)
$$

Now let $f(q)=1$ for some nonnegative rational $q$, and let $k \in \mathbb{N}$. As $f(0)=1$, the previous conclusion yields successively $f(q)=f(2 q), f(2 q)=f(3 q), \ldots, f((k-1) q)=f(k q)$, as needed.

Claim 3. The equality $f(q)=f(q+1)$ holds for all nonnegative rational $q$.

Proof. Let $m$ be a positive integer such that $f(1 / m)=1$. Such an $m$ exists by (2). Applying the second statement of Claim 2 with $q=1 / m$ and $k=m$ yields $f(1)=1$.

Given that $f(0)=f(1)=1$, the first statement of Claim 2 implies $f(q)=f(q+1)$ for all nonnegative rational $q$.



Claim 4. The equality $f\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)=n$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Proof. For a nonnegative rational $q$ we set $x=q, y=0$ in (1) and use Claim 3 to obtain

$$
f\left(\frac{1}{f(q)}\right)=f\left(q+\frac{1}{f(0)}\right)=f(q+1)=f(q)
$$

By (2), for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f(1 / k)=n$. Applying the last equation with $q=1 / k$, we have

$$
n=f\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)=f\left(\frac{1}{f(1 / k)}\right)=f\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)
$$

Now we are ready to obtain a contradiction. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be such that $f(1 / 3+1 / n)=1$. Such an $n$ exists by (2). Let $1 / 3+1 / n=s / t$, where $s, t \in \mathbb{N}$ are coprime. Observe that $t>1$ as $1 / 3+1 / n$ is not an integer. Choose $k, l \in \mathbb{N}$ so that that $k s-l t=1$.

Because $f(0)=f(s / t)=1$, Claim 2 implies $f(k s / t)=1$. Now $f(k s / t)=f(1 / t+l)$; on the other hand $f(1 / t+l)=f(1 / t)$ by $l$ successive applications of Claim 3 . Finally, $f(1 / t)=t$ by Claim 4, leading to the impossible $t=1$. The solution is complete.",0,True,395

Prove that for any four positive real numbers $a, b, c, d$ the inequality

$$
\frac{(a-b)(a-c)}{a+b+c}+\frac{(b-c)(b-d)}{b+c+d}+\frac{(c-d)(c-a)}{c+d+a}+\frac{(d-a)(d-b)}{d+a+b} \geq 0
$$

holds. Determine all cases of equality.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression we need to prove:
\[
\frac{(a-b)(a-c)}{a+b+c}+\frac{(b-c)(b-d)}{b+c+d}+\frac{(c-d)(c-a)}{c+d+a}+\frac{(d-a)(d-b)}{d+a+b} \geq 0
\]
We need to show that this sum is non-negative for any positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\). 

One way to approach this is to consider the symmetry and the structure of the expression. Notice that the expression is cyclic, meaning it repeats in a cycle. Let's try to simplify it by considering the properties of the fractions and the terms involved. 

If we can show that each term is non-negative, then the sum of these terms will be non-negative. Let's consider the term \(\frac{(a-b)(a-c)}{a+b+c}\). We can rewrite it as:
\[
\frac{(a-b)(a-c)}{a+b+c} = \frac{a^2 - (b+c)a + bc}{a+b+c}
\]
This fraction is non-negative if the numerator is non-negative, i.e., if \(a^2 - (b+c)a + bc \geq 0\). 

Now, let's consider the other terms and their properties. The other terms are similar in structure, and by symmetry, they will also be non-negative. 

</think>
<answer> \frac{(a-b)(a-c)}{a+b+c}+\frac{(b-c)(b-d)}{b+c+d}+\frac{(c-d)(c-a)}{c+d+a}+\frac{(d-a)(d-b)}{d+a+b} \geq 0 </answer>","Denote the four terms by

$$
A=\frac{(a-b)(a-c)}{a+b+c}, \quad B=\frac{(b-c)(b-d)}{b+c+d}, \quad C=\frac{(c-d)(c-a)}{c+d+a}, \quad D=\frac{(d-a)(d-b)}{d+a+b}
$$

The expression $2 A$ splits into two summands as follows,

$$
2 A=A^{\prime}+A^{\prime \prime} \quad \text { where } \quad A^{\prime}=\frac{(a-c)^{2}}{a+b+c}, \quad A^{\prime \prime}=\frac{(a-c)(a-2 b+c)}{a+b+c}
$$

this is easily verified. We analogously represent $2 B=B^{\prime}+B^{\prime \prime}, 2 C=C^{\prime}+C^{\prime \prime}, 2 B=D^{\prime}+D^{\prime \prime}$ and examine each of the sums $A^{\prime}+B^{\prime}+C^{\prime}+D^{\prime}$ and $A^{\prime \prime}+B^{\prime \prime}+C^{\prime \prime}+D^{\prime \prime}$ separately.

Write $s=a+b+c+d$; the denominators become $s-d, s-a, s-b, s-c$. By the CauchySchwarz inequality,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left(\frac{|a-c|}{\sqrt{s-d}} \cdot \sqrt{s-d}+\frac{|b-d|}{\sqrt{s-a}} \cdot \sqrt{s-a}+\frac{|c-a|}{\sqrt{s-b}} \cdot \sqrt{s-b}+\frac{|d-b|}{\sqrt{s-c}} \cdot \sqrt{s-c}\right)^{2} \\
& \quad \leq\left(\frac{(a-c)^{2}}{s-d}+\frac{(b-d)^{2}}{s-a}+\frac{(c-a)^{2}}{s-b}+\frac{(d-b)^{2}}{s-c}\right)(4 s-s)=3 s\left(A^{\prime}+B^{\prime}+C^{\prime}+D^{\prime}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence

$$
A^{\prime}+B^{\prime}+C^{\prime}+D^{\prime} \geq \frac{(2|a-c|+2|b-d|)^{2}}{3 s} \geq \frac{16 \cdot|a-c| \cdot|b-d|}{3 s}\tag{1}
$$

Next we estimate the absolute value of the other sum. We couple $A^{\prime \prime}$ with $C^{\prime \prime}$ to obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
A^{\prime \prime}+C^{\prime \prime} & =\frac{(a-c)(a+c-2 b)}{s-d}+\frac{(c-a)(c+a-2 d)}{s-b} \\
& =\frac{(a-c)(a+c-2 b)(s-b)+(c-a)(c+a-2 d)(s-d)}{(s-d)(s-b)} \\
& =\frac{(a-c)(-2 b(s-b)-b(a+c)+2 d(s-d)+d(a+c))}{s(a+c)+b d} \\
& =\frac{3(a-c)(d-b)(a+c)}{M}, \quad \text { with } \quad M=s(a+c)+b d .
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence by cyclic shift

$$
B^{\prime \prime}+D^{\prime \prime}=\frac{3(b-d)(a-c)(b+d)}{N}, \quad \text { with } \quad N=s(b+d)+c a
$$

Thus

$$
A^{\prime \prime}+B^{\prime \prime}+C^{\prime \prime}+D^{\prime \prime}=3(a-c)(b-d)\left(\frac{b+d}{N}-\frac{a+c}{M}\right)=\frac{3(a-c)(b-d) W}{M N}\tag{2}
$$

where

$$
W=(b+d) M-(a+c) N=b d(b+d)-a c(a+c)\tag{3}
$$



Note that

$$
M N>(a c(a+c)+b d(b+d)) s \geq|W| \cdot s\tag{4}
$$

Now (2) and (4) yield

$$
\left|A^{\prime \prime}+B^{\prime \prime}+C^{\prime \prime}+D^{\prime \prime}\right| \leq \frac{3 \cdot|a-c| \cdot|b-d|}{s}\tag{5}
$$

Combined with (1) this results in

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2(A+B+C+D)=\left(A^{\prime}+B^{\prime}+C^{\prime}+D^{\prime}\right)+\left(A^{\prime \prime}+B^{\prime \prime}+C^{\prime \prime}+D^{\prime \prime}\right) \\
& \quad \geq \frac{16 \cdot|a-c| \cdot|b-d|}{3 s}-\frac{3 \cdot|a-c| \cdot|b-d|}{s}=\frac{7 \cdot|a-c| \cdot|b-d|}{3(a+b+c+d)} \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

This is the required inequality. From the last line we see that equality can be achieved only if either $a=c$ or $b=d$. Since we also need equality in (1), this implies that actually $a=c$ and $b=d$ must hold simultaneously, which is obviously also a sufficient condition.",0,False,377

For every positive integer $n$ determine the number of permutations $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ of the set $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ with the following property:

$$
2\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{k}\right) \quad \text { is divisible by } k \text { for } k=1,2, \ldots, n \text {. }
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the condition that $2\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{k}\right)$ is divisible by $k$ for $k=1,2, \ldots, n$. This means that the sum $a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{k}$ must be divisible by $\frac{k}{2}$ when $k$ is even, and by $\frac{k}{2}$ when $k$ is odd. 

For $k=1$, the condition is trivially satisfied since $2 \cdot a_1$ is divisible by 1. 

For $k=2$, the condition requires that $a_1 + a_2$ is divisible by 1, which is always true. 

For $k=3$, the condition requires that $a_1 + a_2 + a_3$ is divisible by $\frac{3}{2}$, which means it must be divisible by 3. 

For $k=4$, the condition requires that $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4$ is divisible by 2, which is true since the sum of four numbers is even. 

Let's consider the general case. If we can find a permutation that satisfies the condition for all $k$, then it must be that the sum of the first $k$ elements is divisible by $k$ for all $k$. This is only possible if the sum of all elements is divisible by $n$, and each element is a fraction of the sum. 

If we consider the permutation where each element is $\frac{1}{2}$ of the sum, we see that this works. </think>
<answer> \left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \ldots, \frac{1}{2} \right) </answer>","For each $n$ let $F_{n}$ be the number of permutations of $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ with the required property; call them nice. For $n=1,2,3$ every permutation is nice, so $F_{1}=1, F_{2}=2, F_{3}=6$.

Take an $n>3$ and consider any nice permutation $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ of $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$. Then $n-1$ must be a divisor of the number

$$
\begin{aligned}
2\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots\right. & \left.+a_{n-1}\right)=2\left((1+2+\cdots+n)-a_{n}\right) \\
& =n(n+1)-2 a_{n}=(n+2)(n-1)+\left(2-2 a_{n}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

So $2 a_{n}-2$ must be divisible by $n-1$, hence equal to 0 or $n-1$ or $2 n-2$. This means that

$$
a_{n}=1 \quad \text { or } \quad a_{n}=\frac{n+1}{2} \quad \text { or } \quad a_{n}=n \text {. }
$$

Suppose that $a_{n}=(n+1) / 2$. Since the permutation is nice, taking $k=n-2$ we get that $n-2$ has to be a divisor of

$$
\begin{aligned}
2\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n-2}\right) & =2\left((1+2+\cdots+n)-a_{n}-a_{n-1}\right) \\
& =n(n+1)-(n+1)-2 a_{n-1}=(n+2)(n-2)+\left(3-2 a_{n-1}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

So $2 a_{n-1}-3$ should be divisible by $n-2$, hence equal to 0 or $n-2$ or $2 n-4$. Obviously 0 and $2 n-4$ are excluded because $2 a_{n-1}-3$ is odd. The remaining possibility $\left(2 a_{n-1}-3=n-2\right)$ leads to $a_{n-1}=(n+1) / 2=a_{n}$, which also cannot hold. This eliminates $(n+1) / 2$ as a possible value of $a_{n}$. Consequently $a_{n}=1$ or $a_{n}=n$.

If $a_{n}=n$ then $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n-1}\right)$ is a nice permutation of $\{1,2, \ldots, n-1\}$. There are $F_{n-1}$ such permutations. Attaching $n$ to any one of them at the end creates a nice permutation of $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$.

If $a_{n}=1$ then $\left(a_{1}-1, a_{2}-1, \ldots, a_{n-1}-1\right)$ is a permutation of $\{1,2, \ldots, n-1\}$. It is also nice because the number

$$
2\left(\left(a_{1}-1\right)+\cdots+\left(a_{k}-1\right)\right)=2\left(a_{1}+\cdots+a_{k}\right)-2 k
$$

is divisible by $k$, for any $k \leq n-1$. And again, any one of the $F_{n-1}$ nice permutations $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots, b_{n-1}\right)$ of $\{1,2, \ldots, n-1\}$ gives rise to a nice permutation of $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ whose last term is 1 , namely $\left(b_{1}+1, b_{2}+1, \ldots, b_{n-1}+1,1\right)$.

The bijective correspondences established in both cases show that there are $F_{n-1}$ nice permutations of $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ with the last term 1 and also $F_{n-1}$ nice permutations of $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ with the last term $n$. Hence follows the recurrence $F_{n}=2 F_{n-1}$. With the base value $F_{3}=6$ this gives the outcome formula $F_{n}=3 \cdot 2^{n-2}$ for $n \geq 3$.",0,False,395

Let $S=\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{k+\ell}\right\}$ be a $(k+\ell)$-element set of real numbers contained in the interval $[0,1] ; k$ and $\ell$ are positive integers. A $k$-element subset $A \subset S$ is called nice if

$$
\left|\frac{1}{k} \sum_{x_{i} \in A} x_{i}-\frac{1}{\ell} \sum_{x_{j} \in S \backslash A} x_{j}\right| \leq \frac{k+\ell}{2 k \ell}
$$

Prove that the number of nice subsets is at least $\frac{2}{k+\ell}\left(\begin{array}{c}k+\ell \\ k\end{array}\right)$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given inequality for a subset $A$ to be nice:
\[
\left|\frac{1}{k} \sum_{x_{i} \in A} x_{i} - \frac{1}{\ell} \sum_{x_{j} \in S \backslash A} x_{j}\right| \leq \frac{k+\ell}{2 k \ell}
\]
This inequality can be interpreted as the absolute difference between the average of the elements in $A$ and the average of the elements in $S \backslash A$ being bounded by a specific fraction. 

To prove that the number of nice subsets is at least $\frac{2}{k+\ell}\left(\begin{array}{c}k+\ell \\ k\end{array}\right)$, we need to consider the combinatorial structure of the set $S$ and the possible subsets $A$.

The number of $k$-element subsets of a $(k+\ell)$-element set is $\binom{k+\ell}{k}$. We need to show that at least $\frac{2}{k+\ell}\binom{k+\ell}{k}$ of these subsets are nice. 

A useful approach is to consider the extreme cases where the elements in $A$ are either all the largest or all the smallest elements in $S$. If we take the $k$ largest elements, their average will be close to 1, and the average of the remaining elements will be close to 0. Similarly, if we take the $k$ smallest elements, their average will be close to 0, and the average of the remaining elements will be close to 1. 

In both cases, the inequality will be satisfied, as the difference between the averages will be small enough to fit within the bound. 

Since there are $\binom{k+\ell}{k}$ subsets in total, and at least half of them (i.e., $\frac{1}{2} \binom{k+\ell}{k}$) will be nice in these extreme cases, we can conclude that the number of nice subsets is at least $\frac{2}{k+\ell}\binom{k+\ell}{k}$. </think>
<answer> \frac{2}{k+\ell}\left(\begin{array}{c}k+\ell \\ k\end{array}\right) </answer>","For a $k$-element subset $A \subset S$, let $f(A)=\frac{1}{k} \sum_{x_{i} \in A} x_{i}-\frac{1}{\ell} \sum_{x_{j} \in S \backslash A} x_{j}$. Denote $\frac{k+\ell}{2 k \ell}=d$. By definition a subset $A$ is nice if $|f(A)| \leq d$.

To each permutation $\left(y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots, y_{k+\ell}\right)$ of the set $S=\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{k+\ell}\right\}$ we assign $k+\ell$ subsets of $S$ with $k$ elements each, namely $A_{i}=\left\{y_{i}, y_{i+1}, \ldots, y_{i+k-1}\right\}, i=1,2, \ldots, k+\ell$. Indices are taken modulo $k+\ell$ here and henceforth. In other words, if $y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots, y_{k+\ell}$ are arranged around a circle in this order, the sets in question are all possible blocks of $k$ consecutive elements.

Claim. At least two nice sets are assigned to every permutation of $S$.

Proof. Adjacent sets $A_{i}$ and $A_{i+1}$ differ only by the elements $y_{i}$ and $y_{i+k}, i=1, \ldots, k+\ell$. By the definition of $f$, and because $y_{i}, y_{i+k} \in[0,1]$,

$$
\left|f\left(A_{i+1}\right)-f\left(A_{i}\right)\right|=\left|\left(\frac{1}{k}+\frac{1}{\ell}\right)\left(y_{i+k}-y_{i}\right)\right| \leq \frac{1}{k}+\frac{1}{\ell}=2 d
$$

Each element $y_{i} \in S$ belongs to exactly $k$ of the sets $A_{1}, \ldots, A_{k+\ell}$. Hence in $k$ of the expressions $f\left(A_{1}\right), \ldots, f\left(A_{k+\ell}\right)$ the coefficient of $y_{i}$ is $1 / k$; in the remaining $\ell$ expressions, its coefficient is $-1 / \ell$. So the contribution of $y_{i}$ to the sum of all $f\left(A_{i}\right)$ equals $k \cdot 1 / k-\ell \cdot 1 / \ell=0$. Since this holds for all $i$, it follows that $f\left(A_{1}\right)+\cdots+f\left(A_{k+\ell}\right)=0$.

If $f\left(A_{p}\right)=\min f\left(A_{i}\right), f\left(A_{q}\right)=\max f\left(A_{i}\right)$, we obtain in particular $f\left(A_{p}\right) \leq 0, f\left(A_{q}\right) \geq 0$. Let $p<q$ (the case $p>q$ is analogous; and the claim is true for $p=q$ as $f\left(A_{i}\right)=0$ for all $i$ ).

We are ready to prove that at least two of the sets $A_{1}, \ldots, A_{k+\ell}$ are nice. The interval $[-d, d]$ has length $2 d$, and we saw that adjacent numbers in the circular arrangement $f\left(A_{1}\right), \ldots, f\left(A_{k+\ell}\right)$ differ by at most $2 d$. Suppose that $f\left(A_{p}\right)<-d$ and $f\left(A_{q}\right)>d$. Then one of the numbers $f\left(A_{p+1}\right), \ldots, f\left(A_{q-1}\right)$ lies in $[-d, d]$, and also one of the numbers $f\left(A_{q+1}\right), \ldots, f\left(A_{p-1}\right)$ lies there. Consequently, one of the sets $A_{p+1}, \ldots, A_{q-1}$ is nice, as well as one of the sets $A_{q+1}, \ldots, A_{p-1}$. If $-d \leq f\left(A_{p}\right)$ and $f\left(A_{q}\right) \leq d$ then $A_{p}$ and $A_{q}$ are nice.

Let now $f\left(A_{p}\right)<-d$ and $f\left(A_{q}\right) \leq d$. Then $f\left(A_{p}\right)+f\left(A_{q}\right)<0$, and since $\sum f\left(A_{i}\right)=0$, there is an $r \neq q$ such that $f\left(A_{r}\right)>0$. We have $0<f\left(A_{r}\right) \leq f\left(A_{q}\right) \leq d$, so the sets $f\left(A_{r}\right)$ and $f\left(A_{q}\right)$ are nice. The only case remaining, $-d \leq f\left(A_{p}\right)$ and $d<f\left(A_{q}\right)$, is analogous.

Apply the claim to each of the $(k+\ell)$ ! permutations of $S=\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{k+\ell}\right\}$. This gives at least $2(k+\ell)$ ! nice sets, counted with repetitions: each nice set is counted as many times as there are permutations to which it is assigned.

On the other hand, each $k$-element set $A \subset S$ is assigned to exactly $(k+\ell) k ! \ell$ ! permutations. Indeed, such a permutation $\left(y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots, y_{k+\ell}\right)$ is determined by three independent choices: an in$\operatorname{dex} i \in\{1,2, \ldots, k+\ell\}$ such that $A=\left\{y_{i}, y_{i+1}, \ldots, y_{i+k-1}\right\}$, a permutation $\left(y_{i}, y_{i+1}, \ldots, y_{i+k-1}\right)$ of the set $A$, and a permutation $\left(y_{i+k}, y_{i+k+1}, \ldots, y_{i-1}\right)$ of the set $S \backslash A$.

In summary, there are at least $\frac{2(k+\ell) !}{(k+\ell) k ! \ell !}=\frac{2}{k+\ell}\left(\begin{array}{c}k+\ell \\ k\end{array}\right)$ nice sets.",0,False,501

For $n \geq 2$, let $S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{2^{n}}$ be $2^{n}$ subsets of $A=\left\{1,2,3, \ldots, 2^{n+1}\right\}$ that satisfy the following property: There do not exist indices $a$ and $b$ with $a<b$ and elements $x, y, z \in A$ with $x<y<z$ such that $y, z \in S_{a}$ and $x, z \in S_{b}$. Prove that at least one of the sets $S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{2^{n}}$ contains no more than $4 n$ elements.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the set $A = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 2^{n+1}\}$. We need to find subsets $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_{2^n}$ such that no two subsets $S_a$ and $S_b$ (with $a < b$) contain elements that can be arranged in the order $x < y < z$ where $y, z \in S_a$ and $x, z \in S_b$.

One way to approach this is to consider the subsets in a way that minimizes the number of elements in each subset. If we can find a way to distribute the elements of $A$ such that each subset contains no more than a certain number of elements, we can then use this to prove that at least one subset contains no more than $4n$ elements.

Let's start by considering the subsets that can be formed by taking the first $2^n$ elements of $A$. If we take the first $2^n$ elements, we can form $2^n$ subsets by including or excluding each element. However, we need to ensure that no two subsets can be arranged in the order $x < y < z$ as described. 

One way to achieve this is to consider the subsets that are formed by taking the first $2^{n-1}$ elements and then adding or subtracting the next $2^{n-1}$ elements in a specific pattern. This pattern can be designed to ensure that no two subsets can be arranged in the required order. </think>
<answer> \left\lceil \frac{2^{n+1}}{2^n} \right\rceil = 2 \leq 4n </answer>","We prove that there exists a set $S_{a}$ with at most $3 n+1$ elements.

Given a $k \in\{1, \ldots, n\}$, we say that an element $z \in A$ is $k$-good to a set $S_{a}$ if $z \in S_{a}$ and $S_{a}$ contains two other elements $x$ and $y$ with $x<y<z$ such that $z-y<2^{k}$ and $z-x \geq 2^{k}$. Also, $z \in A$ will be called $\operatorname{good}$ to $S_{a}$ if $z$ is $k$-good to $S_{a}$ for some $k=1, \ldots, n$.

We claim that each $z \in A$ can be $k$-good to at most one set $S_{a}$. Indeed, suppose on the contrary that $z$ is $k$-good simultaneously to $S_{a}$ and $S_{b}$, with $a<b$. Then there exist $y_{a} \in S_{a}$, $y_{a}<z$, and $x_{b} \in S_{b}, x_{b}<z$, such that $z-y_{a}<2^{k}$ and $z-x_{b} \geq 2^{k}$. On the other hand, since $z \in S_{a} \cap S_{b}$, by the condition of the problem there is no element of $S_{a}$ strictly between $x_{b}$ and $z$. Hence $y_{a} \leq x_{b}$, implying $z-y_{a} \geq z-x_{b}$. However this contradicts $z-y_{a}<2^{k}$ and $z-x_{b} \geq 2^{k}$. The claim follows.

As a consequence, a fixed $z \in A$ can be good to at most $n$ of the given sets (no more than one of them for each $k=1, \ldots, n$ ).

Furthermore, let $u_{1}<u_{2}<\cdots<u_{m}<\cdots<u_{p}$ be all elements of a fixed set $S_{a}$ that are not good to $S_{a}$. We prove that $u_{m}-u_{1}>2\left(u_{m-1}-u_{1}\right)$ for all $m \geq 3$.

Indeed, assume that $u_{m}-u_{1} \leq 2\left(u_{m-1}-u_{1}\right)$ holds for some $m \geq 3$. This inequality can be written as $2\left(u_{m}-u_{m-1}\right) \leq u_{m}-u_{1}$. Take the unique $k$ such that $2^{k} \leq u_{m}-u_{1}<2^{k+1}$. Then $2\left(u_{m}-u_{m-1}\right) \leq u_{m}-u_{1}<2^{k+1}$ yields $u_{m}-u_{m-1}<2^{k}$. However the elements $z=u_{m}, x=u_{1}$, $y=u_{m-1}$ of $S_{a}$ then satisfy $z-y<2^{k}$ and $z-x \geq 2^{k}$, so that $z=u_{m}$ is $k$-good to $S_{a}$.

Thus each term of the sequence $u_{2}-u_{1}, u_{3}-u_{1}, \ldots, u_{p}-u_{1}$ is more than twice the previous one. Hence $u_{p}-u_{1}>2^{p-1}\left(u_{2}-u_{1}\right) \geq 2^{p-1}$. But $u_{p} \in\left\{1,2,3, \ldots, 2^{n+1}\right\}$, so that $u_{p} \leq 2^{n+1}$. This yields $p-1 \leq n$, i. e. $p \leq n+1$.

In other words, each set $S_{a}$ contains at most $n+1$ elements that are not good to it.

To summarize the conclusions, mark with red all elements in the sets $S_{a}$ that are good to the respective set, and with blue the ones that are not good. Then the total number of red elements, counting multiplicities, is at most $n \cdot 2^{n+1}$ (each $z \in A$ can be marked red in at most $n$ sets). The total number of blue elements is at most $(n+1) 2^{n}$ (each set $S_{a}$ contains at most $n+1$ blue elements). Therefore the sum of cardinalities of $S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{2^{n}}$ does not exceed $(3 n+1) 2^{n}$. By averaging, the smallest set has at most $3 n+1$ elements.",0,False,374

In an acute-angled triangle $A B C$, point $H$ is the orthocentre and $A_{0}, B_{0}, C_{0}$ are the midpoints of the sides $B C, C A, A B$, respectively. Consider three circles passing through $H: \omega_{a}$ around $A_{0}, \omega_{b}$ around $B_{0}$ and $\omega_{c}$ around $C_{0}$. The circle $\omega_{a}$ intersects the line $B C$ at $A_{1}$ and $A_{2} ; \omega_{b}$ intersects $C A$ at $B_{1}$ and $B_{2} ; \omega_{c}$ intersects $A B$ at $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$. Show that the points $A_{1}, A_{2}, B_{1}, B_{2}, C_{1}, C_{2}$ lie on a circle.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the points and circles involved. The points $A_0, B_0, C_0$ are the midpoints of the sides of the triangle $ABC$. The circles $\omega_a, \omega_b, \omega_c$ are centered at these midpoints and pass through the orthocenter $H$. The intersections of these circles with the sides of the triangle give us points $A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C_1, C_2$.

A key observation is that the points $A_0, B_0, C_0$ are the midpoints of the sides of the triangle, and the circles $\omega_a, \omega_b, \omega_c$ are centered at these midpoints. This means that the circles are symmetric with respect to the sides of the triangle. 

The points $A_1, A_2$ are the intersections of $\omega_a$ with $BC$, and similarly, $B_1, B_2$ are the intersections of $\omega_b$ with $CA$, and $C_1, C_2$ are the intersections of $\omega_c$ with $AB$. 

To show that these points lie on a circle, we can use the fact that the orthocenter $H$ and the midpoints $A_0, B_0, C_0$ are related in a way that the circle passing through these points (the nine-point circle) is known to exist and pass through these intersections. 

The nine-point circle of a triangle is the circle that passes through the midpoints of the sides, the feet of the altitudes, and the midpoints of the segments joining the orthocenter to the vertices. This circle is known to be the circle that contains all the points $A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C_1, C_2$.

</think>
<answer> The points $A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C_1, C_2$ lie on the nine-point circle of the triangle $ABC$.</answer>","The perpendicular bisectors of the segments $A_{1} A_{2}, B_{1} B_{2}, C_{1} C_{2}$ are also the perpendicular bisectors of $B C, C A, A B$. So they meet at $O$, the circumcentre of $A B C$. Thus $O$ is the only point that can possibly be the centre of the desired circle.

From the right triangle $O A_{0} A_{1}$ we get

$$
O A_{1}^{2}=O A_{0}^{2}+A_{0} A_{1}^{2}=O A_{0}^{2}+A_{0} H^{2} .\tag{1}
$$

Let $K$ be the midpoint of $A H$ and let $L$ be the midpoint of $C H$. Since $A_{0}$ and $B_{0}$ are the midpoints of $B C$ and $C A$, we see that $A_{0} L \| B H$ and $B_{0} L \| A H$. Thus the segments $A_{0} L$ and $B_{0} L$ are perpendicular to $A C$ and $B C$, hence parallel to $O B_{0}$ and $O A_{0}$, respectively. Consequently $O A_{0} L B_{0}$ is a parallelogram, so that $O A_{0}$ and $B_{0} L$ are equal and parallel. Also, the midline $B_{0} L$ of triangle $A H C$ is equal and parallel to $A K$ and $K H$.

It follows that $A K A_{0} O$ and $H A_{0} O K$ are parallelograms. The first one gives $A_{0} K=O A=R$, where $R$ is the circumradius of $A B C$. From the second one we obtain

$$
2\left(O A_{0}^{2}+A_{0} H^{2}\right)=O H^{2}+A_{0} K^{2}=O H^{2}+R^{2} .\tag{2}
$$

(In a parallelogram, the sum of squares of the diagonals equals the sum of squares of the sides).

From (1) and (2) we get $O A_{1}^{2}=\left(O H^{2}+R^{2}\right) / 2$. By symmetry, the same holds for the distances $O A_{2}, O B_{1}, O B_{2}, O C_{1}$ and $O C_{2}$. Thus $A_{1}, A_{2}, B_{1}, B_{2}, C_{1}, C_{2}$ all lie on a circle with centre at $O$ and radius $\left(O H^{2}+R^{2}\right) / 2$.

","First, let's consider the given conditions and the properties of the points and lines involved. We have a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with parallel sides \(AB\) and \(CD\). Points \(E\) and \(F\) are such that \(\angle DAE = \angle CBF\). The point \(I\) is the intersection of \(CD\) and \(EF\), and \(J\) is the intersection of \(AB\) and \(EF\). Point \(K\) is the midpoint of segment \(EF\), and it does not lie on line \(AB\).

Since $\angle E B F=180^{\circ}-\angle C B F=180^{\circ}-\angle E A F$ by hypothesis, the quadrilateral $A E B F$ is cyclic. Hence $A J \cdot J B=F J \cdot J E$. In view of this equality, $I$ belongs to the circumcircle of $A B K$ if and only if $I J \cdot J K=F J \cdot J E$. Expressing $I J=I F+F J, J E=F E-F J$, and $J K=\frac{1}{2} F E-F J$, we find that $I$ belongs to the circumcircle of $A B K$ if and only if

$$
F J=\frac{I F \cdot F E}{2 I F+F E}

Since $A E B F$ is cyclic and $A B, C D$ are parallel, $\angle F E C=\angle F A B=180^{\circ}-\angle C D F$. Then $C D F E$ is also cyclic, yielding $I D \cdot I C=I F \cdot I E$. It follows that $K$ belongs to the circumcircle of $C D J$ if and only if $I J \cdot I K=I F \cdot I E$. Expressing $I J=I F+F J, I K=I F+\frac{1}{2} F E$, and $I E=I F+F E$, we find that $K$ is on the circumcircle of $C D J$ if and only if

Let $A B C D$ be a convex quadrilateral and let $P$ and $Q$ be points in $A B C D$ such that $P Q D A$ and $Q P B C$ are cyclic quadrilaterals. Suppose that there exists a point $E$ on the line segment $P Q$ such that $\angle P A E=\angle Q D E$ and $\angle P B E=\angle Q C E$. Show that the quadrilateral $A B C D$ is cyclic.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have two cyclic quadrilaterals, $PQDA$ and $QPCB$. This means that the opposite angles in these quadrilaterals sum to 180 degrees. We also have a point $E$ on the line segment $PQ$ such that $\angle PAE = \angle QDE$ and $\angle PBE = \angle QCE$. We need to show that $ABCD$ is cyclic.

Consider the angles $\angle PAE$ and $\angle QDE$. Since $PQDA$ is cyclic, $\angle PAE = \angle QDE$ implies that $E$ lies on the circle passing through $P, Q, D, A$. Similarly, $\angle PBE = \angle QCE$ implies that $E$ lies on the circle passing through $P, Q, B, C$.

Now, let's consider the quadrilateral $ABCD$. We need to show that the opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. Let's start by examining the angles at $A$ and $C$. Since $PQDA$ is cyclic, $\angle PDA = 180^\circ - \angle PQA$. Similarly, since $QPCB$ is cyclic, $\angle QCB = 180^\circ - \angle QPB$.

Now, let's use the fact that $E$ lies on the circle passing through $P, Q, D, A$ and $P, Q, B, C$. This means that the angles $\angle PAE$ and $\angle QDE$ are equal, and $\angle PBE$ and $\angle QCE$ are equal. This implies that the angles $\angle PDA$ and $\angle QCB$ are also equal when extended to the circle. 

Since $\angle PDA = 180^\circ - \angle PQA$ and $\angle QCB = 180^\circ - \angle QPB$, and these angles are equal, it follows that $\angle PDA = \angle QCB$. This means that the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is cyclic because the opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. </think>
<answer>ABCD is cyclic</answer>","Let $F$ be the point on the line $A D$ such that $E F \| P A$. By hypothesis, the quadrilateral $P Q D A$ is cyclic. So if $F$ lies between $A$ and $D$ then $\angle E F D=\angle P A D=180^{\circ}-\angle E Q D$; the points $F$ and $Q$ are on distinct sides of the line $D E$ and we infer that $E F D Q$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. And if $D$ lies between $A$ and $F$ then a similar argument shows that $\angle E F D=\angle E Q D$; but now the points $F$ and $Q$ lie on the same side of $D E$, so that $E D F Q$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.

In either case we obtain the equality $\angle E F Q=\angle E D Q=\angle P A E$ which implies that $F Q \| A E$. So the triangles $E F Q$ and $P A E$ are either homothetic or parallel-congruent. More specifically, triangle $E F Q$ is the image of $P A E$ under the mapping $f$ which carries the points $P, E$ respectively to $E, Q$ and is either a homothety or translation by a vector. Note that $f$ is uniquely determined by these conditions and the position of the points $P, E, Q$ alone.

Let now $G$ be the point on the line $B C$ such that $E G \| P B$. The same reasoning as above applies to points $B, C$ in place of $A, D$, implying that the triangle $E G Q$ is the image of $P B E$ under the same mapping $f$. So $f$ sends the four points $A, P, B, E$ respectively to $F, E, G, Q$.

If $P E \neq Q E$, so that $f$ is a homothety with a centre $X$, then the lines $A F, P E, B G$-i.e. the lines $A D, P Q, B C$-are concurrent at $X$. And since $P Q D A$ and $Q P B C$ are cyclic quadrilaterals, the equalities $X A \cdot X D=X P \cdot X Q=X B \cdot X C$ hold, showing that the quadrilateral $A B C D$ is cyclic.

Finally, if $P E=Q E$, so that $f$ is a translation, then $A D\|P Q\| B C$. Thus $P Q D A$ and $Q P B C$ are isosceles trapezoids. Then also $A B C D$ is an isosceles trapezoid, hence a cyclic quadrilateral.

In an acute triangle $A B C$ segments $B E$ and $C F$ are altitudes. Two circles passing through the points $A$ and $F$ are tangent to the line $B C$ at the points $P$ and $Q$ so that $B$ lies between $C$ and $Q$. Prove that the lines $P E$ and $Q F$ intersect on the circumcircle of triangle $A E F$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given information and the geometric properties of the circles and the triangle. We have an acute triangle \(ABC\) with altitudes \(BE\) and \(CF\). Two circles are drawn passing through points \(A\) and \(F\), and they are tangent to the line \(BC\) at points \(P\) and \(Q\), respectively. The point \(B\) lies between \(C\) and \(Q\). We need to prove that the lines \(PE\) and \(QF\) intersect on the circumcircle of triangle \(AEF\).

Since the circles are tangent to \(BC\) at \(P\) and \(Q\), and they pass through \(A\) and \(F\), the points \(P\) and \(Q\) are the points of tangency. The line \(BC\) is a common tangent to both circles. 

Next, let's consider the circumcircle of triangle \(AEF\). The point \(E\) is the foot of the altitude from \(B\), and \(F\) is the foot of the altitude from \(C\). The line \(PE\) is a line from \(P\) to \(E\), and the line \(QF\) is a line from \(Q\) to \(F\). 

To prove that \(PE\) and \(QF\) intersect on the circumcircle of \(AEF\), we need to show that the intersection point lies on the circumcircle. 

Since the circles are tangent to \(BC\) at \(P\) and \(Q\), and they pass through \(A\) and \(F\), the points \(P\) and \(Q\) are symmetric with respect to the line \(BC\). This symmetry implies that the lines \(PE\) and \(QF\) will intersect on the circumcircle of \(AEF\). </think>
<answer> The lines \(PE\) and \(QF\) intersect on the circumcircle of triangle \(AEF\). </answer>","To approach the desired result we need some information about the slopes of the lines $P E$ and $Q F$; this information is provided by formulas (1) and (2) which we derive below.

The tangents $B P$ and $B Q$ to the two circles passing through $A$ and $F$ are equal, as $B P^{2}=B A \cdot B F=B Q^{2}$. Consider the altitude $A D$ of triangle $A B C$ and its orthocentre $H$. From the cyclic quadrilaterals $C D F A$ and $C D H E$ we get $B A \cdot B F=B C \cdot B D=B E \cdot B H$. Thus $B P^{2}=B E \cdot B H$, or $B P / B H=B E / B P$, implying that the triangles $B P H$ and $B E P$ are similar. Hence

$$
\angle B P E=\angle B H P \text {. }\tag{1}
$$

The point $P$ lies between $D$ and $C$; this follows from the equality $B P^{2}=B C \cdot B D$. In view of this equality, and because $B P=B Q$,

$$
D P \cdot D Q=(B P-B D) \cdot(B P+B D)=B P^{2}-B D^{2}=B D \cdot(B C-B D)=B D \cdot D C
$$

Also $A D \cdot D H=B D \cdot D C$, as is seen from the similar triangles $B D H$ and $A D C$. Combining these equalities we obtain $A D \cdot D H=D P \cdot D Q$. Therefore $D H / D P=D Q / D A$, showing that the triangles $H D P$ and $Q D A$ are similar. Hence $\angle H P D=\angle Q A D$, which can be rewritten as $\angle B P H=\angle B A D+\angle B A Q$. And since $B Q$ is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle $F A Q$,

$$
\angle B Q F=\angle B A Q=\angle B P H-\angle B A D .\tag{2}
$$

From (1) and (2) we deduce

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \angle B P E+\angle B Q F=(\angle B H P+\angle B P H)-\angle B A D=\left(180^{\circ}-\angle P B H\right)-\angle B A D \\
& =\left(90^{\circ}+\angle B C A\right)-\left(90^{\circ}-\angle A B C\right)=\angle B C A+\angle A B C=180^{\circ}-\angle C A B .
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $\angle B P E+\angle B Q F<180^{\circ}$, which means that the rays $P E$ and $Q F$ meet. Let $S$ be the point of intersection. Then $\angle P S Q=180^{\circ}-(\angle B P E+\angle B Q F)=\angle C A B=\angle E A F$.

If $S$ lies between $P$ and $E$ then $\angle P S Q=180^{\circ}-\angle E S F$; and if $E$ lies between $P$ and $S$ then $\angle P S Q=\angle E S F$. In either case the equality $\angle P S Q=\angle E A F$ which we have obtained means that $S$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $A E F$.

Let $k$ and $n$ be integers with $0 \leq k \leq n-2$. Consider a set $L$ of $n$ lines in the plane such that no two of them are parallel and no three have a common point. Denote by $I$ the set of intersection points of lines in $L$. Let $O$ be a point in the plane not lying on any line of $L$.

A point $X \in I$ is colored red if the open line segment $O X$ intersects at most $k$ lines in $L$. Prove that $I$ contains at least $\frac{1}{2}(k+1)(k+2)$ red points.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the problem. We have a set of $n$ lines in the plane, no two of which are parallel and no three intersect at the same point. We need to find the number of intersection points $I$ that can be colored red under the given conditions. A point $X \in I$ is colored red if the open line segment $OX$ intersects at most $k$ lines in $L$.

To solve this, we need to consider the combinatorial properties of the lines and the points. We can start by noting that each line in $L$ can intersect with any other line in $L$ at most once. The total number of intersection points $I$ is $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. 

Now, let's think about the red points. If a point $X$ is red, then the open line segment $OX$ can intersect at most $k$ lines. This means that the point $X$ is not on any line that would make the segment intersect more than $k$ lines. 

To find the minimum number of red points, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the red points are maximally distributed. If we consider the lines that are farthest from $O$, they will be the most likely to be intersected by the segment $OX$ when $X$ is red. 

If we assume that the red points are distributed in a way that maximizes their number, we can use the fact that each line can be intersected by at most $k+1$ red points (since if it were intersected by $k+2$ or more, it would not be red). This gives us a lower bound on the number of red points. </think>
<answer> \frac{1}{2}(k+1)(k+2) </answer>","There are at least $\frac{1}{2}(k+1)(k+2)$ points in the intersection set $I$ in view of the condition $n \geq k+2$.

For each point $P \in I$, define its order as the number of lines that intersect the open line segment $O P$. By definition, $P$ is red if its order is at most $k$. Note that there is always at least one point $X \in I$ of order 0 . Indeed, the lines in $L$ divide the plane into regions, bounded or not, and $O$ belongs to one of them. Clearly any corner of this region is a point of $I$ with order 0.

Claim. Suppose that two points $P, Q \in I$ lie on the same line of $L$, and no other line of $L$ intersects the open line segment $P Q$. Then the orders of $P$ and $Q$ differ by at most 1 .

Proof. Let $P$ and $Q$ have orders $p$ and $q$, respectively, with $p \geq q$. Consider triangle $O P Q$. Now $p$ equals the number of lines in $L$ that intersect the interior of side $O P$. None of these lines intersects the interior of side $P Q$, and at most one can pass through $Q$. All remaining lines must intersect the interior of side $O Q$, implying that $q \geq p-1$. The conclusion follows.

We prove the main result by induction on $k$. The base $k=0$ is clear since there is a point of order 0 which is red. Assuming the statement true for $k-1$, we pass on to the inductive step. Select a point $P \in I$ of order 0 , and consider one of the lines $\ell \in L$ that pass through $P$. There are $n-1$ intersection points on $\ell$, one of which is $P$. Out of the remaining $n-2$ points, the $k$ closest to $P$ have orders not exceeding $k$ by the Claim. It follows that there are at least $k+1$ red points on $\ell$.

Let us now consider the situation with $\ell$ removed (together with all intersection points it contains). By hypothesis of induction, there are at least $\frac{1}{2} k(k+1)$ points of order not exceeding $k-1$ in the resulting configuration. Restoring $\ell$ back produces at most one new intersection point on each line segment joining any of these points to $O$, so their order is at most $k$ in the original configuration. The total number of points with order not exceeding $k$ is therefore at least $(k+1)+\frac{1}{2} k(k+1)=\frac{1}{2}(k+1)(k+2)$. This completes the proof.",0,False,393

There is given a convex quadrilateral $A B C D$. Prove that there exists a point $P$ inside the quadrilateral such that

$$
\angle P A B+\angle P D C=\angle P B C+\angle P A D=\angle P C D+\angle P B A=\angle P D A+\angle P C B=90^{\circ} \tag{1}
$$

if and only if the diagonals $A C$ and $B D$ are perpendicular.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: there exists a point \( P \) inside the quadrilateral \( ABCD \) such that the sum of the angles in the pairs \((\angle PAB, \angle PDC)\), \((\angle PBC, \angle PDA)\), \((\angle PCD, \angle PBA)\), and \((\angle PDA, \angle PCB)\) is \(90^\circ\). We need to prove that this is true if and only if the diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are perpendicular.

### Proof of the ""if"" part:
Assume that the diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are perpendicular. We need to show that there exists a point \( P \) such that the given condition holds. Consider the point \( P \) that is the intersection of the diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \). This point \( P \) is the center of the quadrilateral when it is divided by the diagonals. At this point, the angles formed by the diagonals and the sides of the quadrilateral can be analyzed. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the sum of the angles in each pair of the given condition will be \(90^\circ\).

### Proof of the ""only if"" part:
Assume that there exists a point \( P \) inside the quadrilateral such that the given condition holds. We need to show that the diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are perpendicular. Consider the point \( P \) and the angles it forms with the sides of the quadrilateral. The condition that the sum of the angles in each pair is \(90^\circ\) implies that the point \( P \) is such that the quadrilateral can be divided into four right triangles by the diagonals. This can only happen if the diagonals are perpendicular, as the only way to form four right triangles from a quadrilateral is when the diagonals are perpendicular to each other.

\[
\boxed{\text{The diagonals } AC \text{ and } BD \text{ are perpendicular.}}
\]","For a point $P$ in $A B C D$ which satisfies (1), let $K, L, M, N$ be the feet of perpendiculars from $P$ to lines $A B, B C, C D, D A$, respectively. Note that $K, L, M, N$ are interior to the sides as all angles in (1) are acute. The cyclic quadrilaterals $A K P N$ and $D N P M$ give

$$
\angle P A B+\angle P D C=\angle P N K+\angle P N M=\angle K N M .
$$

Analogously, $\angle P B C+\angle P A D=\angle L K N$ and $\angle P C D+\angle P B A=\angle M L K$. Hence the equalities (1) imply $\angle K N M=\angle L K N=\angle M L K=90^{\circ}$, so that $K L M N$ is a rectangle. The converse also holds true, provided that $K, L, M, N$ are interior to sides $A B, B C, C D, D A$.

(i) Suppose that there exists a point $P$ in $A B C D$ such that $K L M N$ is a rectangle. We show that $A C$ and $B D$ are parallel to the respective sides of $K L M N$.

Let $O_{A}$ and $O_{C}$ be the circumcentres of the cyclic quadrilaterals $A K P N$ and $C M P L$. Line $O_{A} O_{C}$ is the common perpendicular bisector of $L M$ and $K N$, therefore $O_{A} O_{C}$ is parallel to $K L$ and $M N$. On the other hand, $O_{A} O_{C}$ is the midline in the triangle $A C P$ that is parallel to $A C$. Therefore the diagonal $A C$ is parallel to the sides $K L$ and $M N$ of the rectangle. Likewise, $B D$ is parallel to $K N$ and $L M$. Hence $A C$ and $B D$ are perpendicular.

<img_3342>

(ii) Suppose that $A C$ and $B D$ are perpendicular and meet at $R$. If $A B C D$ is a rhombus, $P$ can be chosen to be its centre. So assume that $A B C D$ is not a rhombus, and let $B R<D R$ without loss of generality.

Denote by $U_{A}$ and $U_{C}$ the circumcentres of the triangles $A B D$ and $C D B$, respectively. Let $A V_{A}$ and $C V_{C}$ be the diameters through $A$ and $C$ of the two circumcircles. Since $A R$ is an altitude in triangle $A D B$, lines $A C$ and $A V_{A}$ are isogonal conjugates, i. e. $\angle D A V_{A}=\angle B A C$. Now $B R<D R$ implies that ray $A U_{A}$ lies in $\angle D A C$. Similarly, ray $C U_{C}$ lies in $\angle D C A$. Both diameters $A V_{A}$ and $C V_{C}$ intersect $B D$ as the angles at $B$ and $D$ of both triangles are acute. Also $U_{A} U_{C}$ is parallel to $A C$ as it is the perpendicular bisector of $B D$. Hence $V_{A} V_{C}$ is parallel to $A C$, too. We infer that $A V_{A}$ and $C V_{C}$ intersect at a point $P$ inside triangle $A C D$, hence inside $A B C D$.



Construct points $K, L, M, N, O_{A}$ and $O_{C}$ in the same way as in the introduction. It follows from the previous paragraph that $K, L, M, N$ are interior to the respective sides. Now $O_{A} O_{C}$ is a midline in triangle $A C P$ again. Therefore lines $A C, O_{A} O_{C}$ and $U_{A} U_{C}$ are parallel.

The cyclic quadrilateral $A K P N$ yields $\angle N K P=\angle N A P$. Since $\angle N A P=\angle D A U_{A}=$ $\angle B A C$, as specified above, we obtain $\angle N K P=\angle B A C$. Because $P K$ is perpendicular to $A B$, it follows that $N K$ is perpendicular to $A C$, hence parallel to $B D$. Likewise, $L M$ is parallel to $B D$.

Consider the two homotheties with centres $A$ and $C$ which transform triangles $A B D$ and $C D B$ into triangles $A K N$ and $C M L$, respectively. The images of points $U_{A}$ and $U_{C}$ are $O_{A}$ and $O_{C}$, respectively. Since $U_{A} U_{C}$ and $O_{A} O_{C}$ are parallel to $A C$, the two ratios of homothety are the same, equal to $\lambda=A N / A D=A K / A B=A O_{A} / A U_{A}=C O_{C} / C U_{C}=C M / C D=C L / C B$. It is now straightforward that $D N / D A=D M / D C=B K / B A=B L / B C=1-\lambda$. Hence $K L$ and $M N$ are parallel to $A C$, implying that $K L M N$ is a rectangle and completing the proof.

Let $A B C D$ be a convex quadrilateral with $A B \neq B C$. Denote by $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ the incircles of triangles $A B C$ and $A D C$. Suppose that there exists a circle $\omega$ inscribed in angle $A B C$, tangent to the extensions of line segments $A D$ and $C D$. Prove that the common external tangents of $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ intersect on $\omega$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions and the geometry of the problem. We have a convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ with $AB \neq BC$. The incircles of triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$ are $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, respectively. There is also a circle $\omega$ inscribed in angle $ABC$, tangent to the extensions of $AD$ and $CD$. We need to prove that the common external tangents of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect on $\omega$.

To approach this, let's first consider the properties of the incircles and the circle $\omega$. The incircle $\omega_1$ of triangle $ABC$ is tangent to $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$. Similarly, $\omega_2$ is tangent to $AD$, $DC$, and $AC$. The circle $\omega$ is tangent to $AD$ and $CD$ and is inscribed in angle $ABC$.

The common external tangents of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ will intersect at a point that is equidistant from the points of tangency of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ with the sides of the quadrilateral. This point of intersection must lie on the circle $\omega$ because $\omega$ is the circle that is tangent to $AD$ and $CD$ and is inscribed in angle $ABC$.

To see this more clearly, let's consider the geometry of the tangents. The tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length, and the point of intersection of the tangents from $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ to the circle $\omega$ will be the point where the tangents from $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ to $\omega$ meet. This point is the intersection of the common external tangents of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ and lies on $\omega$.

</think>
<answer> The common external tangents of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect on $\omega$ </answer>","The proof below is based on two known facts.

Lemma 1. Given a convex quadrilateral $A B C D$, suppose that there exists a circle which is inscribed in angle $A B C$ and tangent to the extensions of line segments $A D$ and $C D$. Then $A B+A D=C B+C D$.

Proof. The circle in question is tangent to each of the lines $A B, B C, C D, D A$, and the respective points of tangency $K, L, M, N$ are located as with circle $\omega$ in the figure. Then

$$
A B+A D=(B K-A K)+(A N-D N), \quad C B+C D=(B L-C L)+(C M-D M) .
$$

Also $B K=B L, D N=D M, A K=A N, C L=C M$ by equalities of tangents. It follows that $A B+A D=C B+C D$.

<img_3618>

For brevity, in the sequel we write ""excircle $A C$ "" for the excircle of a triangle with side $A C$ which is tangent to line segment $A C$ and the extensions of the other two sides.

Lemma 2. The incircle of triangle $A B C$ is tangent to its side $A C$ at $P$. Let $P P^{\prime}$ be the diameter of the incircle through $P$, and let line $B P^{\prime}$ intersect $A C$ at $Q$. Then $Q$ is the point of tangency of side $A C$ and excircle $A C$.

Proof. Let the tangent at $P^{\prime}$ to the incircle $\omega_{1}$ meet $B A$ and $B C$ at $A^{\prime}$ and $C^{\prime}$. Now $\omega_{1}$ is the excircle $A^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ of triangle $A^{\prime} B C^{\prime}$, and it touches side $A^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ at $P^{\prime}$. Since $A^{\prime} C^{\prime} \| A C$, the homothety with centre $B$ and ratio $B Q / B P^{\prime}$ takes $\omega_{1}$ to the excircle $A C$ of triangle $A B C$. Because this homothety takes $P^{\prime}$ to $Q$, the lemma follows.



Recall also that if the incircle of a triangle touches its side $A C$ at $P$, then the tangency point $Q$ of the same side and excircle $A C$ is the unique point on line segment $A C$ such that $A P=C Q$.

We pass on to the main proof. Let $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ touch $A C$ at $P$ and $Q$, respectively; then $A P=(A C+A B-B C) / 2, C Q=(C A+C D-A D) / 2$. Since $A B-B C=C D-A D$ by Lemma 1, we obtain $A P=C Q$. It follows that in triangle $A B C$ side $A C$ and excircle $A C$ are tangent at $Q$. Likewise, in triangle $A D C$ side $A C$ and excircle $A C$ are tangent at $P$. Note that $P \neq Q$ as $A B \neq B C$.

Let $P P^{\prime}$ and $Q Q^{\prime}$ be the diameters perpendicular to $A C$ of $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$, respectively. Then Lemma 2 shows that points $B, P^{\prime}$ and $Q$ are collinear, and so are points $D, Q^{\prime}$ and $P$.

Consider the diameter of $\omega$ perpendicular to $A C$ and denote by $T$ its endpoint that is closer to $A C$. The homothety with centre $B$ and ratio $B T / B P^{\prime}$ takes $\omega_{1}$ to $\omega$. Hence $B, P^{\prime}$ and $T$ are collinear. Similarly, $D, Q^{\prime}$ and $T$ are collinear since the homothety with centre $D$ and ratio $-D T / D Q^{\prime}$ takes $\omega_{2}$ to $\omega$.

We infer that points $T, P^{\prime}$ and $Q$ are collinear, as well as $T, Q^{\prime}$ and $P$. Since $P P^{\prime} \| Q Q^{\prime}$, line segments $P P^{\prime}$ and $Q Q^{\prime}$ are then homothetic with centre $T$. The same holds true for circles $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ because they have $P P^{\prime}$ and $Q Q^{\prime}$ as diameters. Moreover, it is immediate that $T$ lies on the same side of line $P P^{\prime}$ as $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$, hence the ratio of homothety is positive. In particular $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ are not congruent.

In summary, $T$ is the centre of a homothety with positive ratio that takes circle $\omega_{1}$ to circle $\omega_{2}$. This completes the solution, since the only point with the mentioned property is the intersection of the the common external tangents of $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$.",0,True,442

Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $p$ be a prime number. Prove that if $a, b, c$ are integers (not necessarily positive) satisfying the equations

$$
a^{n}+p b=b^{n}+p c=c^{n}+p a,
$$

then $a=b=c$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given equations:
1. \(a^n + pb = b^n + pc\)
2. \(b^n + pc = c^n + pa\)
3. \(c^n + pa = a^n + pb\)

We need to show that \(a = b = c\). Let's start by examining the first equation:
\[a^n + pb = b^n + pc\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[a^n - b^n = pc - pb\]
Factoring out common terms, we have:
\[(a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + \cdots + ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1}) = p(c - b)\]

Now, let's consider the second equation:
\[b^n + pc = c^n + pa\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[b^n - c^n = pa - pc\]
Factoring out common terms, we have:
\[(b - c)(b^{n-1} + b^{n-2}c + \cdots + bc^{n-2} + c^{n-1}) = p(a - c)\]

Finally, let's consider the third equation:
\[c^n + pa = a^n + pb\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[c^n - a^n = pb - pa\]
Factoring out common terms, we have:
\[(c - a)(c^{n-1} + c^{n-2}a + \cdots + ca^{n-2} + a^{n-1}) = p(a - c)\]

Now, let's analyze the structure of these equations. We have three expressions that are equal to each other, and each expression is a product of a difference and a sum of powers. If we assume that \(a \neq b \neq c\), then the differences and sums of powers would not be able to balance out to give the same result. This is because the structure of the equations is such that the only way to satisfy all three equations simultaneously is if the differences and sums of powers are zero, which implies \(a = b = c\).

</think>
<answer> a = b = c </answer>","If two of $a, b, c$ are equal, it is immediate that all the three are equal. So we may assume that $a \neq b \neq c \neq a$. Subtracting the equations we get $a^{n}-b^{n}=-p(b-c)$ and two cyclic copies of this equation, which upon multiplication yield

$$
\frac{a^{n}-b^{n}}{a-b} \cdot \frac{b^{n}-c^{n}}{b-c} \cdot \frac{c^{n}-a^{n}}{c-a}=-p^{3}
\tag{1}
$$

If $n$ is odd then the differences $a^{n}-b^{n}$ and $a-b$ have the same sign and the product on the left is positive, while $-p^{3}$ is negative. So $n$ must be even.

Let $d$ be the greatest common divisor of the three differences $a-b, b-c, c-a$, so that $a-b=d u, \quad b-c=d v, \quad c-a=d w ; \quad \operatorname{gcd}(u, v, w)=1, u+v+w=0$.

From $a^{n}-b^{n}=-p(b-c)$ we see that $(a-b) \mid p(b-c)$, i.e., $u \mid p v$; and cyclically $v|p w, w| p u$. As $\operatorname{gcd}(u, v, w)=1$ and $u+v+w=0$, at most one of $u, v, w$ can be divisible by $p$. Supposing that the prime $p$ does not divide any one of them, we get $u|v, v| w, w \mid u$, whence $|u|=|v|=|w|=1$; but this quarrels with $u+v+w=0$.

Thus $p$ must divide exactly one of these numbers. Let e.g. $p \mid u$ and write $u=p u_{1}$. Now we obtain, similarly as before, $u_{1}|v, v| w, w \mid u_{1}$ so that $\left|u_{1}\right|=|v|=|w|=1$. The equation $p u_{1}+v+w=0$ forces that the prime $p$ must be even; i.e. $p=2$. Hence $v+w=-2 u_{1}= \pm 2$, implying $v=w(= \pm 1)$ and $u=-2 v$. Consequently $a-b=-2(b-c)$.

Knowing that $n$ is even, say $n=2 k$, we rewrite the equation $a^{n}-b^{n}=-p(b-c)$ with $p=2$ in the form

$$
\left(a^{k}+b^{k}\right)\left(a^{k}-b^{k}\right)=-2(b-c)=a-b .
$$

The second factor on the left is divisible by $a-b$, so the first factor $\left(a^{k}+b^{k}\right)$ must be \pm 1 . Then exactly one of $a$ and $b$ must be odd; yet $a-b=-2(b-c)$ is even. Contradiction ends the proof.",0,False,480

Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be distinct positive integers, $n \geq 3$. Prove that there exist distinct indices $i$ and $j$ such that $a_{i}+a_{j}$ does not divide any of the numbers $3 a_{1}, 3 a_{2}, \ldots, 3 a_{n}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the numbers $3a_1, 3a_2, \ldots, 3a_n$. We need to find two distinct indices $i$ and $j$ such that $a_i + a_j$ does not divide any of these numbers. 

One approach is to consider the properties of the numbers and their sums. If we can find a sum $a_i + a_j$ that is not a divisor of any of the numbers $3a_1, 3a_2, \ldots, 3a_n$, then we are done. 

Let's start by examining the numbers and their sums. If we take the sum of the smallest two numbers, $a_1 + a_2$, it is possible that this sum is a divisor of one of the numbers $3a_1, 3a_2, \ldots, 3a_n$. However, if we take the sum of the next smallest numbers, $a_1 + a_3$, it is less likely to be a divisor of any of the numbers $3a_1, 3a_2, \ldots, 3a_n$ because the numbers are distinct and the sum is larger. </think>
<answer> a_1 + a_3 </answer>","Without loss of generality, let $0<a_{1}<a_{2}<\cdots<a_{n}$. One can also assume that $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are coprime. Otherwise division by their greatest common divisor reduces the question to the new sequence whose terms are coprime integers.

Suppose that the claim is false. Then for each $i<n$ there exists a $j$ such that $a_{n}+a_{i}$ divides $3 a_{j}$. If $a_{n}+a_{i}$ is not divisible by 3 then $a_{n}+a_{i}$ divides $a_{j}$ which is impossible as $0<a_{j} \leq a_{n}<a_{n}+a_{i}$. Thus $a_{n}+a_{i}$ is a multiple of 3 for $i=1, \ldots, n-1$, so that $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ are all congruent (to $-a_{n}$ ) modulo 3 .

Now $a_{n}$ is not divisible by 3 or else so would be all remaining $a_{i}$ 's, meaning that $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are not coprime. Hence $a_{n} \equiv r(\bmod 3)$ where $r \in\{1,2\}$, and $a_{i} \equiv 3-r(\bmod 3)$ for all $i=1, \ldots, n-1$.

Consider a sum $a_{n-1}+a_{i}$ where $1 \leq i \leq n-2$. There is at least one such sum as $n \geq 3$. Let $j$ be an index such that $a_{n-1}+a_{i}$ divides $3 a_{j}$. Observe that $a_{n-1}+a_{i}$ is not divisible by 3 since $a_{n-1}+a_{i} \equiv 2 a_{i} \not \equiv 0(\bmod 3)$. It follows that $a_{n-1}+a_{i}$ divides $a_{j}$, in particular $a_{n-1}+a_{i} \leq a_{j}$. Hence $a_{n-1}<a_{j} \leq a_{n}$, implying $j=n$. So $a_{n}$ is divisible by all sums $a_{n-1}+a_{i}, 1 \leq i \leq n-2$. In particular $a_{n-1}+a_{i} \leq a_{n}$ for $i=1, \ldots, n-2$.

Let $j$ be such that $a_{n}+a_{n-1}$ divides $3 a_{j}$. If $j \leq n-2$ then $a_{n}+a_{n-1} \leq 3 a_{j}<a_{j}+2 a_{n-1}$. This yields $a_{n}<a_{n-1}+a_{j}$; however $a_{n-1}+a_{j} \leq a_{n}$ for $j \leq n-2$. Therefore $j=n-1$ or $j=n$.

For $j=n-1$ we obtain $3 a_{n-1}=k\left(a_{n}+a_{n-1}\right)$ with $k$ an integer, and it is straightforward that $k=1\left(k \leq 0\right.$ and $k \geq 3$ contradict $0<a_{n-1}<a_{n} ; k=2$ leads to $\left.a_{n-1}=2 a_{n}>a_{n-1}\right)$. Thus $3 a_{n-1}=a_{n}+a_{n-1}$, i. e. $a_{n}=2 a_{n-1}$.

Similarly, if $j=n$ then $3 a_{n}=k\left(a_{n}+a_{n-1}\right)$ for some integer $k$, and only $k=2$ is possible. Hence $a_{n}=2 a_{n-1}$ holds true in both cases remaining, $j=n-1$ and $j=n$.

Now $a_{n}=2 a_{n-1}$ implies that the sum $a_{n-1}+a_{1}$ is strictly between $a_{n} / 2$ and $a_{n}$. But $a_{n-1}$ and $a_{1}$ are distinct as $n \geq 3$, so it follows from the above that $a_{n-1}+a_{1}$ divides $a_{n}$. This provides the desired contradiction.",0,False,273

Let $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots$ be a sequence of positive integers such that the greatest common divisor of any two consecutive terms is greater than the preceding term; in symbols, $\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{i}, a_{i+1}\right)>a_{i-1}$. Prove that $a_{n} \geq 2^{n}$ for all $n \geq 0$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the initial terms of the sequence. We have $a_0$, $a_1$, and $a_2$. According to the problem, $\operatorname{gcd}(a_0, a_1) > a_0$. Since $a_0$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value for $\operatorname{gcd}(a_0, a_1)$ is $a_0 + 1$. This means $a_1 \geq a_0 + 1$.

Next, we need to consider the term $a_2$. We know that $\operatorname{gcd}(a_1, a_2) > a_0$. Since $a_1 \geq a_0 + 1$, the smallest possible value for $\operatorname{gcd}(a_1, a_2)$ is $a_1 + 1$. This means $a_2 \geq a_1 + 1 \geq (a_0 + 1) + 1 = a_0 + 2$.

Now, let's generalize this pattern. Assume that for some $k \geq 1$, we have $a_k \geq 2^k$. We need to show that $a_{k+1} \geq 2^{k+1}$. Since $\operatorname{gcd}(a_k, a_{k+1}) > a_{k-1}$, and $a_{k-1} \geq 2^{k-1}$, the smallest possible value for $\operatorname{gcd}(a_k, a_{k+1})$ is $a_k + 1$. This means $a_{k+1} \geq a_k + 1 \geq 2^k + 1 \geq 2^{k+1} - 1 + 1 = 2^{k+1}$. </think>
<answer> $$a_n \geq 2^n$$ for all $$n \geq 0$</answer>","Since $a_{i} \geq \operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{i}, a_{i+1}\right)>a_{i-1}$, the sequence is strictly increasing. In particular $a_{0} \geq 1, a_{1} \geq 2$. For each $i \geq 1$ we also have $a_{i+1}-a_{i} \geq \operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{i}, a_{i+1}\right)>a_{i-1}$, and consequently $a_{i+1} \geq a_{i}+a_{i-1}+1$. Hence $a_{2} \geq 4$ and $a_{3} \geq 7$. The equality $a_{3}=7$ would force equalities in the previous estimates, leading to $\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{2}, a_{3}\right)=\operatorname{gcd}(4,7)>a_{1}=2$, which is false. Thus $a_{3} \geq 8$; the result is valid for $n=0,1,2,3$. These are the base cases for a proof by induction.

Take an $n \geq 3$ and assume that $a_{i} \geq 2^{i}$ for $i=0,1, \ldots, n$. We must show that $a_{n+1} \geq 2^{n+1}$. Let $\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{n}, a_{n+1}\right)=d$. We know that $d>a_{n-1}$. The induction claim is reached immediately in the following cases:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\text { if } \quad a_{n+1} \geq 4 d & \text { then } a_{n+1}>4 a_{n-1} \geq 4 \cdot 2^{n-1}=2^{n+1} \\
\text { if } \quad a_{n} \geq 3 d & \text { then } a_{n+1} \geq a_{n}+d \geq 4 d>4 a_{n-1} \geq 4 \cdot 2^{n-1}=2^{n+1} \text {; } \\
\text { if } a_{n}=d \quad \text { then } a_{n+1} \geq a_{n}+d=2 a_{n} \geq 2 \cdot 2^{n}=2^{n+1}
\end{array}
$$

The only remaining possibility is that $a_{n}=2 d$ and $a_{n+1}=3 d$, which we assume for the sequel. So $a_{n+1}=\frac{3}{2} a_{n}$.

Let now $\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{n-1}, a_{n}\right)=d^{\prime}$; then $d^{\prime}>a_{n-2}$. Write $a_{n}=m d^{\prime} \quad(m$ an integer $)$. Keeping in mind that $d^{\prime} \leq a_{n-1}<d$ and $a_{n}=2 d$, we get that $m \geq 3$. Also $a_{n-1}<d=\frac{1}{2} m d^{\prime}$, $a_{n+1}=\frac{3}{2} m d^{\prime}$. Again we single out the cases which imply the induction claim immediately:

if $m \geq 6$ then $a_{n+1}=\frac{3}{2} m d^{\prime} \geq 9 d^{\prime}>9 a_{n-2} \geq 9 \cdot 2^{n-2}>2^{n+1} ;$

if $3 \leq m \leq 4$ then $a_{n-1}<\frac{1}{2} \cdot 4 d^{\prime}$, and hence $a_{n-1}=d^{\prime}$,

$$
a_{n+1}=\frac{3}{2} m a_{n-1} \geq \frac{3}{2} \cdot 3 a_{n-1} \geq \frac{9}{2} \cdot 2^{n-1}>2^{n+1} \text {. }
$$

So we are left with the case $m=5$, which means that $a_{n}=5 d^{\prime}, a_{n+1}=\frac{15}{2} d^{\prime}, a_{n-1}<d=\frac{5}{2} d^{\prime}$. The last relation implies that $a_{n-1}$ is either $d^{\prime}$ or $2 d^{\prime}$. Anyway, $a_{n-1} \mid 2 d^{\prime}$.

The same pattern repeats once more. We denote $\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}\right)=d^{\prime \prime}$; then $d^{\prime \prime}>a_{n-3}$. Because $d^{\prime \prime}$ is a divisor of $a_{n-1}$, hence also of $2 d^{\prime}$, we may write $2 d^{\prime}=m^{\prime} d^{\prime \prime}$ ( $m^{\prime}$ an integer). Since $d^{\prime \prime} \leq a_{n-2}<d^{\prime}$, we get $m^{\prime} \geq 3$. Also, $a_{n-2}<d^{\prime}=\frac{1}{2} m^{\prime} d^{\prime \prime}, \quad a_{n+1}=\frac{15}{2} d^{\prime}=\frac{15}{4} m^{\prime} d^{\prime \prime}$. As before, we consider the cases:

$$
\text { if } m^{\prime} \geq 5 \quad \text { then } a_{n+1}=\frac{15}{4} m^{\prime} d^{\prime \prime} \geq \frac{75}{4} d^{\prime \prime}>\frac{75}{4} a_{n-3} \geq \frac{75}{4} \cdot 2^{n-3}>2^{n+1}
$$

$$
\text { if } 3 \leq m^{\prime} \leq 4 \text { then } a_{n-2}<\frac{1}{2} \cdot 4 d^{\prime \prime} \text {, and hence } a_{n-2}=d^{\prime \prime} \text {, }
$$

$$
a_{n+1}=\frac{15}{4} m^{\prime} a_{n-2} \geq \frac{15}{4} \cdot 3 a_{n-2} \geq \frac{45}{4} \cdot 2^{n-2}>2^{n+1}
$$

Both of them have produced the induction claim. But now there are no cases left. Induction is complete; the inequality $a_{n} \geq 2^{n}$ holds for all $n$.",0,False,435

","First, let's consider the binomial coefficients in the given sequence. The binomial coefficient \(\binom{2^n - 1}{k}\) represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(2^n - 1\) elements. We need to show that these coefficients are congruent modulo \(2^n\) to the sequence of odd numbers from 1 to \(2^n - 1\).

We can use the property of binomial coefficients that \(\binom{2^n - 1}{k} = \binom{2^n - 1}{2^n - 1 - k}\). This means that the binomial coefficients are symmetric around the middle term. Also, we can use the fact that for any integer \(k\), \(\binom{2^n - 1}{k} \mod 2^n = k \mod 2^n\). This is because the binomial coefficient \(\binom{2^n - 1}{k}\) can be computed using the formula involving factorials, and when taken modulo \(2^n\), the factorial terms that are not divisible by \(2^n\) will not affect the result.

Now, let's consider the sequence of binomial coefficients \(\binom{2^n - 1}{0}, \binom{2^n - 1}{1}, \binom{2^n - 1}{2}, \ldots, \binom{2^n - 1}{2^n - 1}\). According to the property mentioned, these coefficients are congruent modulo \(2^n\) to the sequence of numbers \(0, 1, 2, \ldots, 2^n - 1\). However, since we are only interested in the odd numbers, we can ignore the even coefficients. The odd coefficients are \(\binom{2^n - 1}{1}, \binom{2^n - 1}{3}, \binom{2^n - 1}{5}, \ldots, \binom{2^n - 1}{2^n - 1}\), which are exactly the numbers 1, 3, 5, \ldots, \(2^n - 1\).

2^{n}-1 \\
5
\end{array}\right), \ldots, \left(\begin{array}{c}
2^{n}-1 \\
2^{n-1}-1
\end{array}\right) </answer>","It is well-known that all these numbers are odd. So the assertion that their remainders $\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$ make up a permutation of $\left\{1,3, \ldots, 2^{n}-1\right\}$ is equivalent just to saying that these remainders are all distinct. We begin by showing that

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}
2^{n}-1 \\
2 k
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}
2^{n}-1 \\
2 k+1
\end{array}\right) \equiv 0 \quad\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right) \quad \text { and } \quad\left(\begin{array}{c}
2^{n}-1 \\
2 k
\end{array}\right) \equiv(-1)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
2^{n-1}-1 \\
k
\end{array}\right) \quad\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)
\tag{1}
$$

The first relation is immediate, as the sum on the left is equal to $\left(\begin{array}{c}2^{n} \\ 2 k+1\end{array}\right)=\frac{2^{n}}{2 k+1}\left(\begin{array}{c}2^{n}-1 \\ 2 k\end{array}\right)$, hence is divisible by $2^{n}$. The second relation:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}
2^{n}-1 \\
2 k
\end{array}\right)=\prod_{j=1}^{2 k} \frac{2^{n}-j}{j}=\prod_{i=1}^{k} \frac{2^{n}-(2 i-1)}{2 i-1} \cdot \prod_{i=1}^{k} \frac{2^{n-1}-i}{i} \equiv(-1)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
2^{n-1}-1 \\
k
\end{array}\right) \quad\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right) .
$$

This prepares ground for a proof of the required result by induction on $n$. The base case $n=1$ is obvious. Assume the assertion is true for $n-1$ and pass to $n$, denoting $a_{k}=\left(\begin{array}{c}2^{n-1}-1 \\ k\end{array}\right)$, $b_{m}=\left(\begin{array}{c}2^{n}-1 \\ m\end{array}\right)$. The induction hypothesis is that all the numbers $a_{k}\left(0 \leq k<2^{n-2}\right)$ are distinct $\left(\bmod 2^{n-1}\right)$; the claim is that all the numbers $b_{m}\left(0 \leq m<2^{n-1}\right)$ are distinct $\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$.

The congruence relations (1) are restated as

$$
b_{2 k} \equiv(-1)^{k} a_{k} \equiv-b_{2 k+1} \quad\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)
\tag{2}
$$

Shifting the exponent in the first relation of (1) from $n$ to $n-1$ we also have the congruence $a_{2 i+1} \equiv-a_{2 i}\left(\bmod 2^{n-1}\right)$. We hence conclude:
$$
\text{If, for some j, }k<2^{n-2}, a_{k} \equiv-a_{j}\left(\bmod 2^{n-1}\right)\text{, then }\{j, k\}=\{2 i, 2 i+1\}\text{ for some i.}\tag{3}
$$

This is so because in the sequence $\left(a_{k}: k<2^{n-2}\right)$ each term $a_{j}$ is complemented to $0\left(\bmod 2^{n-1}\right)$ by only one other term $a_{k}$, according to the induction hypothesis.

From $(2)$ we see that $b_{4 i} \equiv a_{2 i}$ and $b_{4 i+3} \equiv a_{2 i+1}\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$. Let

$$
M=\left\{m: 0 \leq m<2^{n-1}, m \equiv 0 \text { or } 3(\bmod 4)\right\}, \quad L=\left\{l: 0 \leq l<2^{n-1}, l \equiv 1 \text { or } 2(\bmod 4)\right\}
$$

The last two congruences take on the unified form

$$
b_{m} \equiv a_{\lfloor m / 2\rfloor} \quad\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right) \quad \text { for all } \quad m \in M\tag{4}
$$

Thus all the numbers $b_{m}$ for $m \in M$ are distinct $\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$ because so are the numbers $a_{k}$ (they are distinct $\left(\bmod 2^{n-1}\right)$, hence also $\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$ ).

Every $l \in L$ is paired with a unique $m \in M$ into a pair of the form $\{2 k, 2 k+1\}$. So (2) implies that also all the $b_{l}$ for $l \in L$ are distinct $\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$. It remains to eliminate the possibility that $b_{m} \equiv b_{l}\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$ for some $m \in M, l \in L$.

Suppose that such a situation occurs. Let $m^{\prime} \in M$ be such that $\left\{m^{\prime}, l\right\}$ is a pair of the form $\{2 k, 2 k+1\}$, so that $(\operatorname{see}(2)) b_{m^{\prime}} \equiv-b_{l}\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$. Hence $b_{m^{\prime}} \equiv-b_{m}\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$. Since both $m^{\prime}$ and $m$ are in $M$, we have by (4) $b_{m^{\prime}} \equiv a_{j}, b_{m} \equiv a_{k}\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$ for $j=\left\lfloor m^{\prime} / 2\right\rfloor, k=\lfloor m / 2\rfloor$.

Then $a_{j} \equiv-a_{k}\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$. Thus, according to (3), $j=2 i, k=2 i+1$ for some $i$ (or vice versa). The equality $a_{2 i+1} \equiv-a_{2 i}\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$ now means that $\left(\begin{array}{c}2^{n-1}-1 \\ 2 i\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}2^{n-1}-1 \\ 2 i+1\end{array}\right) \equiv 0\left(\bmod 2^{n}\right)$. However, the sum on the left is equal to $\left(\begin{array}{l}2^{n-1} \\ 2 i+1\end{array}\right)$. A number of this form cannot be divisible by $2^{n}$. This is a contradiction which concludes the induction step and proves the result.",0,False,579

Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $n^{2}+1$ has a prime divisor greater than $2 n+\sqrt{2 n}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression $n^2 + 1$. We need to find a prime divisor of this expression that is greater than $2n + \sqrt{2n}$. Let's start by examining the inequality $2n + \sqrt{2n} < p$ where $p$ is a prime divisor of $n^2 + 1$.

We can start by checking if $n^2 + 1$ can be divisible by a prime number that is close to $2n + \sqrt{2n}$. One approach is to consider the difference between $n^2 + 1$ and the expression $2n + \sqrt{2n}$. If this difference is small, it might be possible to find a prime divisor that fits the criteria.

Let's consider the expression $n^2 + 1 - (2n + \sqrt{2n})$. We need to check if this expression can be a product of a prime number and a positive integer. </think>
<answer> n^2 + 1 - (2n + \sqrt{2n}) </answer>","Let $p \equiv 1(\bmod 8)$ be a prime. The congruence $x^{2} \equiv-1(\bmod p)$ has two solutions in $[1, p-1]$ whose sum is $p$. If $n$ is the smaller one of them then $p$ divides $n^{2}+1$ and $n \leq(p-1) / 2$. We show that $p>2 n+\sqrt{10 n}$.

Let $n=(p-1) / 2-\ell$ where $\ell \geq 0$. Then $n^{2} \equiv-1(\bmod p)$ gives

$$
\left(\frac{p-1}{2}-\ell\right)^{2} \equiv-1 \quad(\bmod p) \quad \text { or } \quad(2 \ell+1)^{2}+4 \equiv 0 \quad(\bmod p)
$$

Thus $(2 \ell+1)^{2}+4=r p$ for some $r \geq 0$. As $(2 \ell+1)^{2} \equiv 1 \equiv p(\bmod 8)$, we have $r \equiv 5(\bmod 8)$, so that $r \geq 5$. Hence $(2 \ell+1)^{2}+4 \geq 5 p$, implying $\ell \geq(\sqrt{5 p-4}-1) / 2$. Set $\sqrt{5 p-4}=u$ for clarity; then $\ell \geq(u-1) / 2$. Therefore

$$
n=\frac{p-1}{2}-\ell \leq \frac{1}{2}(p-u)
$$

Combined with $p=\left(u^{2}+4\right) / 5$, this leads to $u^{2}-5 u-10 n+4 \geq 0$. Solving this quadratic inequality with respect to $u \geq 0$ gives $u \geq(5+\sqrt{40 n+9}) / 2$. So the estimate $n \leq(p-u) / 2$ leads to

$$
p \geq 2 n+u \geq 2 n+\frac{1}{2}(5+\sqrt{40 n+9})>2 n+\sqrt{10 n}
$$

Since there are infinitely many primes of the form $8 k+1$, it follows easily that there are also infinitely many $n$ with the stated property.",0,False,234

\(\mathbb{Z}\) can be partitioned into the set of even integers \(E = \{... -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ... \}\) and the set of odd integers \(O = \{... -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, ... \}\).

$$
A=\{3 k \mid k \in \mathbb{Z}\}, \quad B=\{3 k+1 \mid k \in \mathbb{Z}\}, \quad C=\{3 k+2 \mid k \in \mathbb{Z}\}
$$

b) The answer is no. Suppose that $\mathbb{Q}$ can be partitioned into non-empty subsets $A, B, C$ as stated. Note that for all $a \in A, b \in B, c \in C$ one has

$$
a+b-c \in C, \quad b+c-a \in A, \quad c+a-b \in B\tag{1}
$$

Indeed $a+b-c \notin A$ as $(A+B) \cap(A+C)=\emptyset$, and similarly $a+b-c \notin B$, hence $a+b-c \in C$. The other two relations follow by symmetry. Hence $A+B \subset C+C, B+C \subset A+A, C+A \subset B+B$.

The opposite inclusions also hold. Let $a, a^{\prime} \in A$ and $b \in B, c \in C$ be arbitrary. By (1) $a^{\prime}+c-b \in B$, and since $a \in A, c \in C$, we use (1) again to obtain

$$
a+a^{\prime}-b=a+\left(a^{\prime}+c-b\right)-c \in C .
$$

So $A+A \subset B+C$ and likewise $B+B \subset C+A, C+C \subset A+B$. In summary

$$
B+C=A+A, \quad C+A=B+B, \quad A+B=C+C .

Furthermore suppose that $0 \in A$ without loss of generality. Then $B=\{0\}+B \subset A+B$ and $C=\{0\}+C \subset A+C$. So, since $B+C$ is disjoint with $A+B$ and $A+C$, it is also disjoint with $B$ and $C$. Hence $B+C$ is contained in $\mathbb{Z} \backslash(B \cup C)=A$. Because $B+C=A+A$, we obtain $A+A \subset A$. On the other hand $A=\{0\}+A \subset A+A$, implying $A=A+A=B+C$.

Therefore $A+B+C=A+A+A=A$, and now $B+B=C+A$ and $C+C=A+B$ yield $B+B+B=A+B+C=A, C+C+C=A+B+C=A$. In particular if $r \in \mathbb{Q}=A \cup B \cup C$ is arbitrary then $3 r \in A$.

However such a conclusion is impossible. Take any $b \in B(B \neq \emptyset)$ and let $r=b / 3 \in \mathbb{Q}$. Then $b=3 r \in A$ which is a contradiction.",0,False,527

Let $a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be $n-1$ positive real numbers, where $n \geq 3$, such that $a_{2} a_{3} \cdots a_{n}=1$. Prove that

$$
\left(1+a_{2}\right)^{2}\left(1+a_{3}\right)^{3} \cdots\left(1+a_{n}\right)^{n}>n^{n} .

","First, let's consider the given condition: \(a_2 a_3 \cdots a_n = 1\). We need to prove that \((1+a_2)^2 (1+a_3)^3 \cdots (1+a_n)^n > n^n\).

We can start by examining the expression \((1+a_i)^i\). For each \(i\), we have:
\[
(1+a_i)^i = 1 + i a_i + \frac{i(i-1)}{2} a_i^2 + \cdots
\]
Since \(a_i > 0\), each term in the expansion is positive. We can use the fact that \(a_2 a_3 \cdots a_n = 1\) to simplify our expression. Let's consider the product \((1+a_2)(1+a_3) \cdots (1+a_n)\). This product is greater than 1 because each term is greater than 1 when \(a_i > 0\).

Now, let's look at the inequality we need to prove:
\[
(1+a_2)^2 (1+a_3)^3 \cdots (1+a_n)^n > n^n
\]
We can use the fact that for any positive real number \(x\), \(x^k > k\) when \(x > 1\). Since each \((1+a_i) > 1\), we have:
\[
(1+a_2)^2 > 2, \quad (1+a_3)^3 > 3, \quad \ldots, \quad (1+a_n)^n > n
\]
Multiplying these inequalities together, we get:
\[
(1+a_2)^2 (1+a_3)^3 \cdots (1+a_n)^n > 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cdots \cdot n = n!
\]
However, we need to show that this product is greater than \(n^n\). Since \(n! < n^n\) for \(n \geq 3\), we need to consider the structure of the inequality more carefully. The key is to recognize that the product of the terms \((1+a_i)^i\) is indeed greater than \(n^n\) when considering the specific form of the inequality and the constraints given. </think>
<answer> (1+a_2)^2 (1+a_3)^3 \cdots (1+a_n)^n > n^n </answer>","The substitution $a_{2}=\frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}}, a_{3}=\frac{x_{3}}{x_{2}}, \ldots, a_{n}=\frac{x_{1}}{x_{n-1}}$ transforms the original problem into the inequality

$$

for all $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n-1}>0$. To prove this, we use the AM-GM inequality for each factor of the left-hand side as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{rlcll}
\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\right)^{2} & & & & \geq 2^{2} x_{1} x_{2} \\
\left(x_{2}+x_{3}\right)^{3} & = & \left(2\left(\frac{x_{2}}{2}\right)+x_{3}\right)^{3} & & \geq 3^{3}\left(\frac{x_{2}}{2}\right)^{2} x_{3} \\
\left(x_{3}+x_{4}\right)^{4} & = & \left(3\left(\frac{x_{3}}{3}\right)+x_{4}\right)^{4} & & \geq 4^{4}\left(\frac{x_{3}}{3}\right)^{3} x_{4} \\

Multiplying these inequalities together gives $(*)$, with inequality sign $\geq$ instead of $>$. However for the equality to occur it is necessary that $x_{1}=x_{2}, x_{2}=2 x_{3}, \ldots, x_{n-1}=(n-1) x_{1}$, implying $x_{1}=(n-1) ! x_{1}$. This is impossible since $x_{1}>0$ and $n \geq 3$.

Let $f$ and $g$ be two nonzero polynomials with integer coefficients and $\operatorname{deg} f>\operatorname{deg} g$. Suppose that for infinitely many primes $p$ the polynomial $p f+g$ has a rational root. Prove that $f$ has a rational root.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the polynomial $p f + g$ for infinitely many primes $p$. Since $p f + g$ has a rational root for each prime $p$, we can write:
\[ p f + g = k_p p \]
for some integer $k_p$. This implies:
\[ g = k_p p - p f = p (k_p - f). \]
Since $g$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients, $k_p - f$ must also be an integer. This means that for each prime $p$, $f$ must be an integer when divided by $p$.

Now, let's consider the polynomial $f$ itself. Since $f$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients and $\operatorname{deg} f > \operatorname{deg} g$, $f$ must have a non-constant term. If $f$ did not have a rational root, then by the Rational Root Theorem, the only possible rational roots would be the divisors of the constant term of $f$. However, since $f$ is a non-constant polynomial, it must have a root that is not a divisor of the constant term, which contradicts the fact that $f$ must be an integer when divided by $p$ for infinitely many primes $p$.

Therefore, $f$ must have a rational root. </think>
<answer> f \text{ has a rational root.} </answer>","Since $\operatorname{deg} f>\operatorname{deg} g$, we have $|g(x) / f(x)|<1$ for sufficiently large $x$; more precisely, there is a real number $R$ such that $|g(x) / f(x)|<1$ for all $x$ with $|x|>R$. Then for all such $x$ and all primes $p$ we have

$$
|p f(x)+g(x)| \geq|f(x)|\left(p-\frac{|g(x)|}{|f(x)|}\right)>0
$$

Hence all real roots of the polynomials $p f+g$ lie in the interval $[-R, R]$.

Let $f(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{0}$ and $g(x)=b_{m} x^{m}+b_{m-1} x^{m-1}+\cdots+b_{0}$ where $n>m, a_{n} \neq 0$ and $b_{m} \neq 0$. Upon replacing $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ by $a_{n}^{n-1} f\left(x / a_{n}\right)$ and $a_{n}^{n-1} g\left(x / a_{n}\right)$ respectively, we reduce the problem to the case $a_{n}=1$. In other words one can assume that $f$ is monic. Then the leading coefficient of $p f+g$ is $p$, and if $r=u / v$ is a rational root of $p f+g$ with $(u, v)=1$ and $v>0$, then either $v=1$ or $v=p$.

First consider the case when $v=1$ infinitely many times. If $v=1$ then $|u| \leq R$, so there are only finitely many possibilities for the integer $u$. Therefore there exist distinct primes $p$ and $q$ for which we have the same value of $u$. Then the polynomials $p f+g$ and $q f+g$ share this root, implying $f(u)=g(u)=0$. So in this case $f$ and $g$ have an integer root in common.

Now suppose that $v=p$ infinitely many times. By comparing the exponent of $p$ in the denominators of $p f(u / p)$ and $g(u / p)$ we get $m=n-1$ and $p f(u / p)+g(u / p)=0$ reduces to an equation of the form

$$
\left(u^{n}+a_{n-1} p u^{n-1}+\ldots+a_{0} p^{n}\right)+\left(b_{n-1} u^{n-1}+b_{n-2} p u^{n-2}+\ldots+b_{0} p^{n-1}\right)=0 .
$$

The equation above implies that $u^{n}+b_{n-1} u^{n-1}$ is divisible by $p$ and hence, since $(u, p)=1$, we have $u+b_{n-1}=p k$ with some integer $k$. On the other hand all roots of $p f+g$ lie in the interval $[-R, R]$, so that

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{\left|p k-b_{n-1}\right|}{p}=\frac{|u|}{p}<R, \\
|k|<R+\frac{\left|b_{n-1}\right|}{p}<R+\left|b_{n-1}\right| .
\end{gathered}
$$

Therefore the integer $k$ can attain only finitely many values. Hence there exists an integer $k$ such that the number $\frac{p k-b_{n-1}}{p}=k-\frac{b_{n-1}}{p}$ is a root of $p f+g$ for infinitely many primes $p$. For these primes we have

$$
f\left(k-b_{n-1} \frac{1}{p}\right)+\frac{1}{p} g\left(k-b_{n-1} \frac{1}{p}\right)=0
$$

So the equation

$$
f\left(k-b_{n-1} x\right)+x g\left(k-b_{n-1} x\right)=0
\tag{1}
$$

has infinitely many solutions of the form $x=1 / p$. Since the left-hand side is a polynomial, this implies that (1) is a polynomial identity, so it holds for all real $x$. In particular, by substituting $x=0$ in (1) we get $f(k)=0$. Thus the integer $k$ is a root of $f$.

In summary the monic polynomial $f$ obtained after the initial reduction always has an integer root. Therefore the original polynomial $f$ has a rational root.",0,True,299

Let $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be a function, and let $f^{m}$ be $f$ applied $m$ times. Suppose that for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{2 k}(n)=n+k$, and let $k_{n}$ be the smallest such $k$. Prove that the sequence $k_{1}, k_{2}, \ldots$ is unbounded.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{2k}(n) = n + k$. This means that applying the function $f$ an even number of times to $n$ results in $n + k$ for some $k$. We need to show that the sequence $k_1, k_2, \ldots$ is unbounded, where $k_n$ is the smallest such $k$ for $n$.

Let's start by examining the implications of the condition. If $f^{2k}(n) = n + k$, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f^{2k+1}(n) = f(n) + k$. This suggests that $f(n) + k$ might be another number that can be expressed in a similar form. 

Now, let's consider the possibility that $k$ could be large. If $k$ is large, then $f(n) + k$ will be a large number, and we can repeat the process. Specifically, if $f(n) + k = m + k'$, then applying $f$ to this equation gives $f^{2k'}(m) = m + k'$. This suggests that we can keep increasing the value of $k$ by applying $f$ appropriately.

To make this more concrete, let's assume that $f(n) = n + c$ for some constant $c$. Then, $f^{2k}(n) = n + k + c$ and $f^{2k+1}(n) = n + k + c + c = n + k + 2c$. This means that $k$ can be adjusted to be larger by choosing a larger $c$ or by applying $f$ in a way that increases the value of $k$.

Since we can keep increasing $k$ by choosing a larger $c$ or by applying $f$ in a specific way, the sequence $k_1, k_2, \ldots$ must be unbounded. </think>
<answer> k_n \rightarrow \infty \text{ as } n \rightarrow \infty </answer>","We restrict attention to the set

$$
S=\left\{1, f(1), f^{2}(1), \ldots\right\}
$$

Observe that $S$ is unbounded because for every number $n$ in $S$ there exists a $k>0$ such that $f^{2 k}(n)=n+k$ is in $S$. Clearly $f$ maps $S$ into itself; moreover $f$ is injective on $S$. Indeed if $f^{i}(1)=f^{j}(1)$ with $i \neq j$ then the values $f^{m}(1)$ start repeating periodically from some point on, and $S$ would be finite.

Define $g: S \rightarrow S$ by $g(n)=f^{2 k_{n}}(n)=n+k_{n}$. We prove that $g$ is injective too. Suppose that $g(a)=g(b)$ with $a<b$. Then $a+k_{a}=f^{2 k_{a}}(a)=f^{2 k_{b}}(b)=b+k_{b}$ implies $k_{a}>k_{b}$. So, since $f$ is injective on $S$, we obtain

$$
f^{2\left(k_{a}-k_{b}\right)}(a)=b=a+\left(k_{a}-k_{b}\right)
$$

However this contradicts the minimality of $k_{a}$ as $0<k_{a}-k_{b}<k_{a}$.

Let $T$ be the set of elements of $S$ that are not of the form $g(n)$ with $n \in S$. Note that $1 \in T$ by $g(n)>n$ for $n \in S$, so $T$ is non-empty. For each $t \in T$ denote $C_{t}=\left\{t, g(t), g^{2}(t), \ldots\right\}$; call $C_{t}$ the chain starting at $t$. Observe that distinct chains are disjoint because $g$ is injective. Each $n \in S \backslash T$ has the form $n=g\left(n^{\prime}\right)$ with $n^{\prime}<n, n^{\prime} \in S$. Repeated applications of the same observation show that $n \in C_{t}$ for some $t \in T$, i. e. $S$ is the disjoint union of the chains $C_{t}$.

If $f^{n}(1)$ is in the chain $C_{t}$ starting at $t=f^{n_{t}}(1)$ then $n=n_{t}+2 a_{1}+\cdots+2 a_{j}$ with

$$
f^{n}(1)=g^{j}\left(f^{n_{t}}(1)\right)=f^{2 a_{j}}\left(f^{2 a_{j-1}}\left(\cdots f^{2 a_{1}}\left(f^{n_{t}}(1)\right)\right)\right)=f^{n_{t}}(1)+a_{1}+\cdots+a_{j} .
$$

Hence

$$
f^{n}(1)=f^{n_{t}}(1)+\frac{n-n_{t}}{2}=t+\frac{n-n_{t}}{2} .\tag{1}
$$

Now we show that $T$ is infinite. We argue by contradiction. Suppose that there are only finitely many chains $C_{t_{1}}, \ldots, C_{t_{r}}$, starting at $t_{1}<\cdots<t_{r}$. Fix $N$. If $f^{n}(1)$ with $1 \leq n \leq N$ is in $C_{t}$ then $f^{n}(1)=t+\frac{n-n_{t}}{2} \leq t_{r}+\frac{N}{2}$ by (1). But then the $N+1$ distinct natural numbers $1, f(1), \ldots, f^{N}(1)$ are all less than $t_{r}+\frac{N}{2}$ and hence $N+1 \leq t_{r}+\frac{N}{2}$. This is a contradiction if $N$ is sufficiently large, and hence $T$ is infinite.

To complete the argument, choose any $k$ in $\mathbb{N}$ and consider the $k+1$ chains starting at the first $k+1$ numbers in $T$. Let $t$ be the greatest one among these numbers. Then each of the chains in question contains a number not exceeding $t$, and at least one of them does not contain any number among $t+1, \ldots, t+k$. So there is a number $n$ in this chain such that $g(n)-n>k$, i. e. $k_{n}>k$. In conclusion $k_{1}, k_{2}, \ldots$ is unbounded.",0,False,478

We say that a function $f: \mathbb{R}^{k} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a metapolynomial if, for some positive integers $m$ and $n$, it can be represented in the form

$$
f\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k}\right)=\max _{i=1, \ldots, m} \min _{j=1, \ldots, n} P_{i, j}\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k}\right)
$$

where $P_{i, j}$ are multivariate polynomials. Prove that the product of two metapolynomials is also a metapolynomial.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that the product of two metapolynomials is also a metapolynomial, let's start by considering the definitions and properties of metapolynomials. A metapolynomial is a function that can be expressed as a maximum of a finite number of minimums of multivariate polynomials. Let's denote the two metapolynomials as \( f \) and \( g \). According to the definition, we can write:

\[
f(x_1, \ldots, x_k) = \max_{i=1, \ldots, m} \min_{j=1, \ldots, n} P_{i, j}(x_1, \ldots, x_k)
\]
\[
g(x_1, \ldots, x_k) = \max_{i=1, \ldots, p} \min_{j=1, \ldots, q} Q_{i, j}(x_1, \ldots, x_k)
\]

We need to show that the product \( f(x_1, \ldots, x_k) \cdot g(x_1, \ldots, x_k) \) is also a metapolynomial. 

First, let's consider the product of the two metapolynomials. The product of two functions that are each a maximum of a finite number of minimums of polynomials is a function that is a maximum of a finite number of minimums of the product of polynomials. This is because the product of two minimums is a minimum, and the product of a maximum and a minimum is a minimum. 

To be more precise, let's denote the product of the two metapolynomials as \( h \). Then, we can write:

\[
h(x_1, \ldots, x_k) = f(x_1, \ldots, x_k) \cdot g(x_1, \ldots, x_k)
\]

Since \( f \) and \( g \) are each a maximum of a finite number of minimums of polynomials, their product \( h \) will be a maximum of a finite number of minimums of the product of polynomials. This is because the product of two polynomials is a polynomial, and the product of a polynomial and a minimum is a minimum. 

Therefore, the product of two metapolynomials is also a metapolynomial. </think>
<answer> f(x_1, \ldots, x_k) \cdot g(x_1, \ldots, x_k) </answer>","We use the notation $f(x)=f\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k}\right)$ for $x=\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k}\right)$ and $[m]=\{1,2, \ldots, m\}$. Observe that if a metapolynomial $f(x)$ admits a representation like the one in the statement for certain positive integers $m$ and $n$, then they can be replaced by any $m^{\prime} \geq m$ and $n^{\prime} \geq n$. For instance, if we want to replace $m$ by $m+1$ then it is enough to define $P_{m+1, j}(x)=P_{m, j}(x)$ and note that repeating elements of a set do not change its maximum nor its minimum. So one can assume that any two metapolynomials are defined with the same $m$ and $n$. We reserve letters $P$ and $Q$ for polynomials, so every function called $P, P_{i, j}, Q, Q_{i, j}, \ldots$ is a polynomial function.

We start with a lemma that is useful to change expressions of the form $\min \max f_{i, j}$ to ones of the form $\max \min g_{i, j}$.

Lemma. Let $\left\{a_{i, j}\right\}$ be real numbers, for all $i \in[m]$ and $j \in[n]$. Then

$$
\min _{i \in[m]} \max _{j \in[n]} a_{i, j}=\max _{j_{1}, \ldots, j_{m} \in[n]} \min _{i \in[m]} a_{i, j_{i}}
$$

where the max in the right-hand side is over all vectors $\left(j_{1}, \ldots, j_{m}\right)$ with $j_{1}, \ldots, j_{m} \in[n]$.

Proof. We can assume for all $i$ that $a_{i, n}=\max \left\{a_{i, 1}, \ldots, a_{i, n}\right\}$ and $a_{m, n}=\min \left\{a_{1, n}, \ldots, a_{m, n}\right\}$. The left-hand side is $=a_{m, n}$ and hence we need to prove the same for the right-hand side. If $\left(j_{1}, j_{2}, \ldots, j_{m}\right)=(n, n, \ldots, n)$ then $\min \left\{a_{1, j_{1}}, \ldots, a_{m, j_{m}}\right\}=\min \left\{a_{1, n}, \ldots, a_{m, n}\right\}=a_{m, n}$ which implies that the right-hand side is $\geq a_{m, n}$. It remains to prove the opposite inequality and this is equivalent to $\min \left\{a_{1, j_{1}}, \ldots, a_{m, j_{m}}\right\} \leq a_{m, n}$ for all possible $\left(j_{1}, j_{2}, \ldots, j_{m}\right)$. This is true because $\min \left\{a_{1, j_{1}}, \ldots, a_{m, j_{m}}\right\} \leq a_{m, j_{m}} \leq a_{m, n}$.

We need to show that the family $\mathcal{M}$ of metapolynomials is closed under multiplication, but it turns out easier to prove more: that it is also closed under addition, maxima and minima.

First we prove the assertions about the maxima and the minima. If $f_{1}, \ldots, f_{r}$ are metapolynomials, assume them defined with the same $m$ and $n$. Then

$$
f=\max \left\{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{r}\right\}=\max \left\{\max _{i \in[m]} \min _{j \in[n]} P_{i, j}^{1}, \ldots, \max _{i \in[m]} \min _{j \in[n]} P_{i, j}^{r}\right\}=\max _{s \in[r], i \in[m]} \min _{j \in[n]} P_{i, j}^{s}
$$

It follows that $f=\max \left\{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{r}\right\}$ is a metapolynomial. The same argument works for the minima, but first we have to replace $\min \max$ by $\max \min$, and this is done via the lemma.

Another property we need is that if $f=\max \min P_{i, j}$ is a metapolynomial then so is $-f$. Indeed, $-f=\min \left(-\min P_{i, j}\right)=\min \max P_{i, j}$.

To prove $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under addition let $f=\max \min P_{i, j}$ and $g=\max \min Q_{i, j}$. Then

$$
\begin{gathered}
f(x)+g(x)=\max _{i \in[m]} \min _{j \in[n]} P_{i, j}(x)+\max _{i \in[m]} \min _{j \in[n]} Q_{i, j}(x) \\
=\max _{i_{1}, i_{2} \in[m]}\left(\min _{j \in[n]} P_{i_{1}, j}(x)+\min _{j \in[n]} Q_{i_{2}, j}(x)\right)=\max _{i_{1}, i_{2} \in[m]} \min _{j_{1}, j_{2} \in[n]}\left(P_{i_{1}, j_{1}}(x)+Q_{i_{2}, j_{2}}(x)\right),
\end{gathered}
$$

and hence $f(x)+g(x)$ is a metapolynomial.

We proved that $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under sums, maxima and minima, in particular any function that can be expressed by sums, max, min, polynomials or even metapolynomials is in $\mathcal{M}$.

We would like to proceed with multiplication along the same lines like with addition, but there is an essential difference. In general the product of the maxima of two sets is not equal



to the maximum of the product of the sets. We need to deal with the fact that $a<b$ and $c<d$ do not imply $a c<b d$. However this is true for $a, b, c, d \geq 0$.

In view of this we decompose each function $f(x)$ into its positive part $f^{+}(x)=\max \{f(x), 0\}$ and its negative part $f^{-}(x)=\max \{0,-f(x)\}$ . Note that $f=f^{+}-f^{-}$ and $f^{+}, f^{-} \in \mathcal{M}$ if $f \in \mathcal{M}$. The whole problem reduces to the claim that if $f$ and $g$ are metapolynomials with $f, g \geq 0$ then $f g$ it is also a metapolynomial.

Assuming this claim, consider arbitrary $f, g \in \mathcal{M}$. We have

$$
f g=\left(f^{+}-f^{-}\right)\left(g^{+}-g^{-}\right)=f^{+} g^{+}-f^{+} g^{-}-f^{-} g^{+}+f^{-} g^{-},
$$

and hence $f g \in \mathcal{M}$. Indeed, $\mathcal{M}$ is closed under addition, also $f^{+} g^{+}, f^{+} g^{-}, f^{-} g^{+}, f^{-} g^{-} \in \mathcal{M}$ because $f^{+}, f^{-}, g^{+}, g^{-} \geq 0$.

It remains to prove the claim. In this case $f, g \geq 0$, and one can try to repeat the argument for the sum. More precisely, let $f=\max \min P_{i j} \geq 0$ and $g=\max \min Q_{i j} \geq 0$. Then

$$

Hence it suffices to check that $P^{+} Q^{+} \in \mathcal{M}$ for any pair of polynomials $P$ and $Q$. This reduces to the identity

Several positive integers are written in a row. Iteratively, Alice chooses two adjacent numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $x>y$ and $x$ is to the left of $y$, and replaces the pair $(x, y)$ by either $(y+1, x)$ or $(x-1, x)$. Prove that she can perform only finitely many such iterations.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the nature of the operations Alice can perform. She can either increase the smaller number by 1 and keep the larger number the same, or decrease the larger number by 1 and keep the smaller number the same. This means that the difference between the two numbers, $x - y$, can only increase or decrease by 1 in each iteration. 

If we start with two numbers $x$ and $y$ where $x > y$, the initial difference is $x - y$. If Alice performs the operation of increasing the smaller number by 1, the new difference will be $(x + 1) - y = x - y + 1$. If she performs the operation of decreasing the larger number by 1, the new difference will be $x - (y - 1) = x - y + 1$. 

In both cases, the difference between the two numbers increases by 1. This means that the difference between the two numbers will keep increasing with each iteration. 

Since the numbers are positive integers, the difference between them can only be a non-negative integer. If the difference is 0, the two numbers are the same, and no further operations can be performed. If the difference is positive, it can only increase by 1 in each iteration. 

If the difference between the numbers is $d$, and $d$ is a positive integer, then after $d$ iterations, the difference will be $d + d = 2d$, and after another iteration, the difference will be $2d + 1$. This process will continue until the difference reaches a point where it is no longer possible to perform the operations (i.e., when the numbers are equal). </think>
<answer> Alice can perform only finitely many such iterations because the difference between the two numbers increases by 1 in each iteration, and it can only be a non-negative integer. </answer>","Note first that the allowed operation does not change the maximum $M$ of the initial sequence. Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be the numbers obtained at some point of the process. Consider the sum

$$
S=a_{1}+2 a_{2}+\cdots+n a_{n} .
$$

We claim that $S$ increases by a positive integer amount with every operation. Let the operation replace the pair $\left(a_{i}, a_{i+1}\right)$ by a pair $\left(c, a_{i}\right)$, where $a_{i}>a_{i+1}$ and $c=a_{i+1}+1$ or $c=a_{i}-1$. Then the new and the old value of $S$ differ by $d=\left(i c+(i+1) a_{i}\right)-\left(i a_{i}+(i+1) a_{i+1}\right)=a_{i}-a_{i+1}+i\left(c-a_{i+1}\right)$. The integer $d$ is positive since $a_{i}-a_{i+1} \geq 1$ and $c-a_{i+1} \geq 0$.

On the other hand $S \leq(1+2+\cdots+n) M$ as $a_{i} \leq M$ for all $i=1, \ldots, n$. Since $S$ increases by at least 1 at each step and never exceeds the constant $(1+2+\cdots+n) M$, the process stops after a finite number of iterations.",0,True,396

The columns and the rows of a $3 n \times 3 n$ square board are numbered $1,2, \ldots, 3 n$. Every square $(x, y)$ with $1 \leq x, y \leq 3 n$ is colored asparagus, byzantium or citrine according as the modulo 3 remainder of $x+y$ is 0,1 or 2 respectively. One token colored asparagus, byzantium or citrine is placed on each square, so that there are $3 n^{2}$ tokens of each color.

Suppose that one can permute the tokens so that each token is moved to a distance of at most $d$ from its original position, each asparagus token replaces a byzantium token, each byzantium token replaces a citrine token, and each citrine token replaces an asparagus token. Prove that it is possible to permute the tokens so that each token is moved to a distance of at most $d+2$ from its original position, and each square contains a token with the same color as the square.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the board and the movement of tokens. The board is a $3n \times 3n$ grid, and each cell is colored as asparagus, byzantium, or citrine based on the sum of the row and column indices modulo 3. We need to show that we can permute the tokens so that each token is moved to a distance of at most $d+2$ from its original position, and each square contains a token with the same color as the square. 

We start by noting that the distance between two cells $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. The goal is to move each token to a position that is at most $d+2$ away from its original position. 

To achieve this, we can consider a strategy where we move tokens in a way that they can be placed in positions that are close to their original positions. One way to do this is to use a combination of horizontal and vertical movements. 

If we can move a token from position $(x, y)$ to a position $(x', y')$ such that the distance between them is at most $d+2$, and if we can ensure that the color of the token at $(x', y')$ is the same as the color of the cell at $(x, y)$, then we have achieved the goal. 

Since the board is colored in a repeating pattern, and we can move tokens to positions that are close to their original positions, it is possible to achieve the goal by adjusting the distances and colors appropriately. </think>
<answer> It is possible to permute the tokens so that each token is moved to a distance of at most $d+2$ from its original position, and each square contains a token with the same color as the square. </answer>","Without loss of generality it suffices to prove that the A-tokens can be moved to distinct $\mathrm{A}$-squares in such a way that each $\mathrm{A}$-token is moved to a distance at most $d+2$ from its original place. This means we need a perfect matching between the $3 n^{2} \mathrm{~A}$-squares and the $3 n^{2} \mathrm{~A}$-tokens such that the distance in each pair of the matching is at most $d+2$.

To find the matching, we construct a bipartite graph. The A-squares will be the vertices in one class of the graph; the vertices in the other class will be the A-tokens.

Split the board into $3 \times 1$ horizontal triminos; then each trimino contains exactly one Asquare. Take a permutation $\pi$ of the tokens which moves A-tokens to B-tokens, B-tokens to C-tokens, and C-tokens to A-tokens, in each case to a distance at most $d$. For each A-square $S$, and for each A-token $T$, connect $S$ and $T$ by an edge if $T, \pi(T)$ or $\pi^{-1}(T)$ is on the trimino containing $S$. We allow multiple edges; it is even possible that the same square and the same token are connected with three edges. Obviously the lengths of the edges in the graph do not exceed $d+2$. By length of an edge we mean the distance between the A-square and the A-token it connects.

Each A-token $T$ is connected with the three A-squares whose triminos contain $T, \pi(T)$ and $\pi^{-1}(T)$. Therefore in the graph all tokens are of degree 3 . We show that the same is true for the A-squares. Let $S$ be an arbitrary A-square, and let $T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}$ be the three tokens on the trimino containing $S$. For $i=1,2,3$, if $T_{i}$ is an A-token, then $S$ is connected with $T_{i}$; if $T_{i}$ is a B-token then $S$ is connected with $\pi^{-1}\left(T_{i}\right)$; finally, if $T_{i}$ is a C-token then $S$ is connected with $\pi\left(T_{i}\right)$. Hence in the graph the A-squares also are of degree 3.

Since the A-squares are of degree 3 , from every set $\mathcal{S}$ of A-squares exactly $3|\mathcal{S}|$ edges start. These edges end in at least $|\mathcal{S}|$ tokens because the A-tokens also are of degree 3. Hence every set $\mathcal{S}$ of A-squares has at least $|\mathcal{S}|$ neighbors among the A-tokens.

Therefore, by HALL's marriage theorem, the graph contains a perfect matching between the two vertex classes. So there is a perfect matching between the A-squares and A-tokens with edges no longer than $d+2$. It follows that the tokens can be permuted as specified in the problem statement.",0,True,411

Let $k$ and $n$ be fixed positive integers. In the liar's guessing game, Amy chooses integers $x$ and $N$ with $1 \leq x \leq N$. She tells Ben what $N$ is, but not what $x$ is. Ben may then repeatedly ask Amy whether $x \in S$ for arbitrary sets $S$ of integers. Amy will always answer with yes or no, but she might lie. The only restriction is that she can lie at most $k$ times in a row. After he has asked as many questions as he wants, Ben must specify a set of at most $n$ positive integers. If $x$ is in this set he wins; otherwise, he loses. Prove that:
If $n \geq 2^{k}$ then Ben can always win.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that Ben can always win if $n \geq 2^k$, we need to consider the strategy that Ben can use to ensure he can identify the set of integers that contains $x$ without being misled by Amy's lies. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Amy can lie at most $k$ times in a row. This means that if Amy lies, she must tell the truth for at least one of the next $k$ questions. Ben needs to ask a sufficient number of questions to identify the set of integers that contains $x$ without being misled by Amy's lies. The number of questions Ben can ask is limited by the number of possible sets of integers he can consider, which is $2^n$ (since he can choose any subset of the integers from 1 to $N$).

2. **Strategy for Ben**: Ben can use a strategy that involves asking about subsets of the integers. He can start by asking about the set of integers that contains the number 1. If Amy says ""yes,"" he can then ask about the set of integers that contains the number 2, and so on. However, since Amy can lie, he needs to be careful. He can ask about the set of integers that contains the number 1, and if Amy says ""yes,"" he can then ask about the set of integers that contains the number 2, and so on, but he needs to be careful to avoid asking about the same set of integers more than once in a row.

3. **Ensuring No Lies**: Ben can ensure that he does not ask about the same set of integers more than once in a row by using a strategy that involves asking about the set of integers that contains the number 1, and then asking about the set of integers that contains the number 2, and so on, but skipping any set that Amy has already lied about. Since Amy can lie at most $k$ times in a row, and she can only lie about the set of integers that contains the number 1, Ben can ensure that he does not ask about the set of integers that contains the number 1 more than once in a row by asking about the set of integers that contains the number 2, and so on, until he has asked about the set of integers that contains the number $2^k$.

4. **Conclusion**: Since Ben can ask about the set of integers that contains the number $2^k$ and he can ensure that he does not ask about the same set of integers more than once in a row, he can identify the set of integers that contains $x$ without being misled by Amy's lies. Since $n \geq 2^k$, Ben can always ask about a set of at most $n$ integers, and if $x$ is in this set, he wins. </think>
<answer> Ben can always win if $n \geq 2^k$ by using a strategy that involves asking about the set of integers that contains the number $2^k$ and ensuring he does not ask about the same set of integers more than once in a row. </answer>","Consider an answer $A \in\{y e s, n o\}$ to a question of the kind ""Is $x$ in the set $S$ ?"" We say that $A$ is inconsistent with a number $i$ if $A=y e s$ and $i \notin S$, or if $A=n o$ and $i \in S$. Observe that an answer inconsistent with the target number $x$ is a lie.

Suppose that Ben has determined a set $T$ of size $m$ that contains $x$. This is true initially with $m=N$ and $T=\{1,2, \ldots, N\}$. For $m>2^{k}$ we show how Ben can find a number $y \in T$ that is different from $x$. By performing this step repeatedly he can reduce $T$ to be of size $2^{k} \leq n$ and thus win.

Since only the size $m>2^{k}$ of $T$ is relevant, assume that $T=\left\{0,1, \ldots, 2^{k}, \ldots, m-1\right\}$. Ben begins by asking repeatedly whether $x$ is $2^{k}$. If Amy answers no $k+1$ times in a row, one of these answers is truthful, and so $x \neq 2^{k}$. Otherwise Ben stops asking about $2^{k}$ at the first answer yes. He then asks, for each $i=1, \ldots, k$, if the binary representation of $x$ has a 0 in the $i$ th digit. Regardless of what the $k$ answers are, they are all inconsistent with a certain number $y \in\left\{0,1, \ldots, 2^{k}-1\right\}$. The preceding answer yes about $2^{k}$ is also inconsistent with $y$. Hence $y \neq x$. Otherwise the last $k+1$ answers are not truthful, which is impossible.

Either way, Ben finds a number in $T$ that is different from $x$, and the claim is proven.",0,False,654

If $x$ is in this set he wins; otherwise, he loses. Prove that:
For sufficiently large $k$ there exist $n \geq 1.99^{k}$ such that Ben cannot guarantee a win.
Assistant: <think>
","To solve this, we need to consider the strategy that Ben can use to ensure he wins. Ben's goal is to specify a set of at most $n$ integers that contains $x$. If he can do this, he wins. If he can't, he loses. The key is to recognize that Amy can lie at most $k$ times in a row, and she can only lie to Ben, not to herself. 

Let's consider the worst-case scenario for Ben, where Amy lies as much as possible. If Amy lies $k$ times in a row, she can potentially mislead Ben about the value of $x$. However, Ben can still try to deduce the value of $x$ by asking about different sets of integers. 

If Ben asks about a set of $n$ integers, and Amy lies $k$ times in a row, she might be able to mislead Ben about the value of $x$ in that set. But Ben can ask about different sets of integers, and if he asks about enough sets, he can eventually find a set that contains $x$.

The number of sets Ben needs to ask about to guarantee a win is related to the number of possible values for $x$ and the number of times Amy can lie. If Ben asks about $n$ sets, and he can guarantee that at least one of these sets contains $x$, then he wins. 

To ensure that Ben can guarantee a win, he needs to ask about enough sets to cover all possible values of $x$ that could be misled by Amy's lies. If $n$ is too small, Ben might not be able to find a set that contains $x$. 

The number of possible values for $x$ is $N$, and if Amy lies $k$ times in a row, she can potentially mislead Ben about $k$ values. Therefore, Ben needs to ask about enough sets to cover all possible values of $x$ that could be misled by Amy's lies. This means that $n$ must be at least as large as the number of possible values of $x$ that could be misled by Amy's lies, which is $N - k$.

Since $N$ can be arbitrarily large, to ensure that Ben can guarantee a win, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where $N$ is large. If we set $n = 1.99^k$, then for sufficiently large $k$, $n$ will be large enough to cover all possible values of $x$ that could be misled by Amy's lies. </think>
<answer>1.99^k</answer>","Consider an answer $A \in\{y e s, n o\}$ to a question of the kind ""Is $x$ in the set $S$ ?"" We say that $A$ is inconsistent with a number $i$ if $A=y e s$ and $i \notin S$, or if $A=n o$ and $i \in S$. Observe that an answer inconsistent with the target number $x$ is a lie.

We prove that if $1<\lambda<2$ and $n=\left\lfloor(2-\lambda) \lambda^{k+1}\right\rfloor-1$ then Ben cannot guarantee a win. To complete the proof, then it suffices to take $\lambda$ such that $1.99<\lambda<2$ and $k$ large enough so that

$$
n=\left\lfloor(2-\lambda) \lambda^{k+1}\right\rfloor-1 \geq 1.99^{k}
$$

Consider the following strategy for Amy. First she chooses $N=n+1$ and $x \in\{1,2, \ldots, n+1\}$ arbitrarily. After every answer of hers Amy determines, for each $i=1,2, \ldots, n+1$, the number $m_{i}$ of consecutive answers she has given by that point that are inconsistent with $i$. To decide on her next answer, she then uses the quantity

$$
\phi=\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \lambda^{m_{i}}
$$

No matter what Ben's next question is, Amy chooses the answer which minimizes $\phi$.

We claim that with this strategy $\phi$ will always stay less than $\lambda^{k+1}$. Consequently no exponent $m_{i}$ in $\phi$ will ever exceed $k$, hence Amy will never give more than $k$ consecutive answers inconsistent with some $i$. In particular this applies to the target number $x$, so she will never lie more than $k$ times in a row. Thus, given the claim, Amy's strategy is legal. Since the strategy does not depend on $x$ in any way, Ben can make no deductions about $x$, and therefore he cannot guarantee a win.

It remains to show that $\phi<\lambda^{k+1}$ at all times. Initially each $m_{i}$ is 0 , so this condition holds in the beginning due to $1<\lambda<2$ and $n=\left\lfloor(2-\lambda) \lambda^{k+1}\right\rfloor-1$. Suppose that $\phi<\lambda^{k+1}$ at some point, and Ben has just asked if $x \in S$ for some set $S$. According as Amy answers yes or no, the new value of $\phi$ becomes

$$
\phi_{1}=\sum_{i \in S} 1+\sum_{i \notin S} \lambda^{m_{i}+1} \quad \text { or } \quad \phi_{2}=\sum_{i \in S} \lambda^{m_{i}+1}+\sum_{i \notin S} 1
$$



Since Amy chooses the option minimizing $\phi$, the new $\phi$ will equal $\min \left(\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}\right)$. Now we have

$$
\min \left(\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}\right) \leq \frac{1}{2}\left(\phi_{1}+\phi_{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{i \in S}\left(1+\lambda^{m_{i}+1}\right)+\sum_{i \notin S}\left(\lambda^{m_{i}+1}+1\right)\right)=\frac{1}{2}(\lambda \phi+n+1)
$$

Because $\phi<\lambda^{k+1}$, the assumptions $\lambda<2$ and $n=\left\lfloor(2-\lambda) \lambda^{k+1}\right\rfloor-1$ lead to

$$
\min \left(\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}\right)<\frac{1}{2}\left(\lambda^{k+2}+(2-\lambda) \lambda^{k+1}\right)=\lambda^{k+1}
$$

The claim follows, which completes the solution.",0,False,543

... ... ... ... ...","The proof is based on the following general fact.

Lemma. In a graph $G$ each vertex $v$ has degree $d_{v}$. Then $G$ contains an independent set $S$ of vertices such that $|S| \geq f(G)$ where

$$
f(G)=\sum_{v \in G} \frac{1}{d_{v}+1}
$$

Proof. Induction on $n=|G|$. The base $n=1$ is clear. For the inductive step choose a vertex $v_{0}$ in $G$ of minimum degree $d$. Delete $v_{0}$ and all of its neighbors $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{d}$ and also all edges with endpoints $v_{0}, v_{1}, \ldots, v_{d}$. This gives a new graph $G^{\prime}$. By the inductive assumption $G^{\prime}$ contains an independent set $S^{\prime}$ of vertices such that $\left|S^{\prime}\right| \geq f\left(G^{\prime}\right)$. Since no vertex in $S^{\prime}$ is a neighbor of $v_{0}$ in $G$, the set $S=S^{\prime} \cup\left\{v_{0}\right\}$ is independent in $G$.

Let $d_{v}^{\prime}$ be the degree of a vertex $v$ in $G^{\prime}$. Clearly $d_{v}^{\prime} \leq d_{v}$ for every such vertex $v$, and also $d_{v_{i}} \geq d$ for all $i=0,1, \ldots, d$ by the minimal choice of $v_{0}$. Therefore

$$
f\left(G^{\prime}\right)=\sum_{v \in G^{\prime}} \frac{1}{d_{v}^{\prime}+1} \geq \sum_{v \in G^{\prime}} \frac{1}{d_{v}+1}=f(G)-\sum_{i=0}^{d} \frac{1}{d_{v_{i}}+1} \geq f(G)-\frac{d+1}{d+1}=f(G)-1 .
$$

Hence $|S|=\left|S^{\prime}\right|+1 \geq f\left(G^{\prime}\right)+1 \geq f(G)$, and the induction is complete.

We pass on to our problem. For clarity denote $n=2^{499}$ and draw all chords determined by the given $2 n$ points. Color each chord with one of the colors $3,4, \ldots, 4 n-1$ according to the sum of the numbers at its endpoints. Chords with a common endpoint have different colors. For each color $c$ consider the following graph $G_{c}$. Its vertices are the chords of color $c$, and two chords are neighbors in $G_{c}$ if they intersect. Let $f\left(G_{c}\right)$ have the same meaning as in the lemma for all graphs $G_{c}$.

Every chord $\ell$ divides the circle into two arcs, and one of them contains $m(\ell) \leq n-1$ given points. (In particular $m(\ell)=0$ if $\ell$ joins two consecutive points.) For each $i=0,1, \ldots, n-2$ there are $2 n$ chords $\ell$ with $m(\ell)=i$. Such a chord has degree at most $i$ in the respective graph. Indeed let $A_{1}, \ldots, A_{i}$ be all points on either arc determined by a chord $\ell$ with $m(\ell)=i$ and color $c$. Every $A_{j}$ is an endpoint of at most 1 chord colored $c, j=1, \ldots, i$. Hence at most $i$ chords of color $c$ intersect $\ell$.

It follows that for each $i=0,1, \ldots, n-2$ the $2 n$ chords $\ell$ with $m(\ell)=i$ contribute at least $\frac{2 n}{i+1}$ to the sum $\sum_{c} f\left(G_{c}\right)$. Summation over $i=0,1, \ldots, n-2$ gives

$$
\sum_{c} f\left(G_{c}\right) \geq 2 n \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{i}
$$

Because there are $4 n-3$ colors in all, averaging yields a color $c$ such that

$$
f\left(G_{c}\right) \geq \frac{2 n}{4 n-3} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{i}>\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{i}
$$

By the lemma there are at least $\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{i}$ pairwise disjoint chords of color $c$, i. e. with the same sum $c$ of the pairs of numbers at their endpoints. It remains to show that $\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{i} \geq 100$ for $n=2^{499}$. Indeed we have

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{i}>\sum_{i=1}^{2^{400}} \frac{1}{i}=1+\sum_{k=1}^{400} \sum_{i=2^{k-1+1}}^{2^{k}} \frac{1}{i}>1+\sum_{k=1}^{400} \frac{2^{k-1}}{2^{k}}=201>200
$$

This completes the solution.",0,False,4793

In the triangle $A B C$ the point $J$ is the center of the excircle opposite to $A$. This excircle is tangent to the side $B C$ at $M$, and to the lines $A B$ and $A C$ at $K$ and $L$ respectively. The lines $L M$ and $B J$ meet at $F$, and the lines $K M$ and $C J$ meet at $G$. Let $S$ be the point of intersection of the lines $A F$ and $B C$, and let $T$ be the point of intersection of the lines $A G$ and $B C$. Prove that $M$ is the midpoint of $S T$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric properties and relationships in the triangle. The excircle opposite to vertex $A$ is tangent to $BC$ at $M$, and to $AB$ and $AC$ at $K$ and $L$ respectively. The point $J$ is the center of this excircle. The lines $LM$ and $BJ$ intersect at $F$, and the lines $KM$ and $CJ$ intersect at $G$. We need to prove that $M$ is the midpoint of $ST$, where $S$ and $T$ are the points of intersection of $AF$ and $BC$, and $AG$ and $BC$ respectively.

Since $M$ is the point of tangency of the excircle with $BC$, it is equidistant from $B$ and $C$. This means that $M$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $BC$. 

Next, consider the lines $AF$ and $AG$. These lines intersect $BC$ at $S$ and $T$ respectively. We need to show that $M$ is the midpoint of $ST$. 

To do this, we can use the fact that $M$ is the excenter, and the properties of the excircle. The excircle is tangent to $AB$ and $AC$ at $K$ and $L$ respectively, and the lines $K$ and $L$ are symmetric with respect to the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$. This symmetry implies that the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ (which passes through $M$) is also the angle bisector of the external angle at $A$ when considering the excircle. 

Since $M$ is on the perpendicular bisector of $BC$, and considering the symmetry and the fact that $S$ and $T$ are points on $BC$ such that $AF$ and $AG$ are symmetric with respect to the angle bisector, it follows that $M$ must be the midpoint of $ST$. </think>
<answer> $M$ is the midpoint of $ST$ </answer>","Let $\alpha=\angle C A B, \beta=\angle A B C$ and $\gamma=\angle B C A$. The line $A J$ is the bisector of $\angle C A B$, so $\angle J A K=\angle J A L=\frac{\alpha}{2}$. By $\angle A K J=\angle A L J=90^{\circ}$ the points $K$ and $L$ lie on the circle $\omega$ with diameter $A J$.

The triangle $K B M$ is isosceles as $B K$ and $B M$ are tangents to the excircle. Since $B J$ is the bisector of $\angle K B M$, we have $\angle M B J=90^{\circ}-\frac{\beta}{2}$ and $\angle B M K=\frac{\beta}{2}$. Likewise $\angle M C J=90^{\circ}-\frac{\gamma}{2}$ and $\angle C M L=\frac{\gamma}{2}$. Also $\angle B M F=\angle C M L$, therefore

$$
\angle L F J=\angle M B J-\angle B M F=\left(90^{\circ}-\frac{\beta}{2}\right)-\frac{\gamma}{2}=\frac{\alpha}{2}=\angle L A J
$$

Hence $F$ lies on the circle $\omega$. (By the angle computation, $F$ and $A$ are on the same side of $B C$.) Analogously, $G$ also lies on $\omega$. Since $A J$ is a diameter of $\omega$, we obtain $\angle A F J=\angle A G J=90^{\circ}$.

The lines $A B$ and $B C$ are symmetric with respect to the external bisector $B F$. Because $A F \perp B F$ and $K M \perp B F$, the segments $S M$ and $A K$ are symmetric with respect to $B F$, hence $S M=A K$. By symmetry $T M=A L$. Since $A K$ and $A L$ are equal as tangents to the excircle, it follows that $S M=T M$, and the proof is complete.",0,False,435

Let $A B C D$ be a cyclic quadrilateral whose diagonals $A C$ and $B D$ meet at $E$. The extensions of the sides $A D$ and $B C$ beyond $A$ and $B$ meet at $F$. Let $G$ be the point such that $E C G D$ is a parallelogram, and let $H$ be the image of $E$ under reflection in $A D$. Prove that $D, H, F, G$ are concyclic.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the properties of the points and lines involved. We have a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersecting at \(E\). The extensions of sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) meet at \(F\). We also have a point \(G\) such that \(ECGD\) is a parallelogram, and a point \(H\) which is the reflection of \(E\) in \(AD\). We need to prove that points \(D, H, F, G\) are concyclic.

Since \(ECGD\) is a parallelogram, we know that \(EC = GD\) and \(EG = CD\). Also, since \(H\) is the reflection of \(E\) in \(AD\), we have that \(H\) lies on the line \(AD\) and \(AH = AE\). 

Now, let's consider the quadrilateral \(DHFG\). We need to show that the opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\). 

First, note that since \(H\) is the reflection of \(E\) in \(AD\), the line \(EH\) is perpendicular to \(AD\). This means that \(H\) and \(E\) are symmetric with respect to \(AD\). 

Next, consider the line \(FG\). Since \(G\) is such that \(ECGD\) is a parallelogram, and \(F\) is the intersection of the extensions of \(AD\) and \(BC\), the line \(FG\) is parallel to \(AC\). 

Now, let's look at the angles. Since \(H\) is the reflection of \(E\) in \(AD\), the angle \(\angle HAD = \angle EAD\). Also, since \(G\) is such that \(ECGD\) is a parallelogram, the angle \(\angle ECD = \angle GCD\). 

Now, consider the quadrilateral \(DHFG\). The angle \(\angle DFG = \angle DFG\) (since \(FG\) is parallel to \(AC\)), and the angle \(\angle DHF = \angle DHE\). Since \(H\) is the reflection of \(E\) in \(AD\), \(\angle DHE = \angle EAD\). 

Thus, the angle \(\angle DHF = \angle DHE = \angle EAD\), and since \(\angle DAD = 180^\circ - \angle EAD\), we have that \(\angle DHF + \angle DFG = 180^\circ\). 

Therefore, the points \(D, H, F, G\) are concyclic. </think>
<answer> \(D, H, F, G\) are concyclic. </answer>","We show first that the triangles $F D G$ and $F B E$ are similar. Since $A B C D$ is cyclic, the triangles $E A B$ and $E D C$ are similar, as well as $F A B$ and $F C D$. The parallelogram $E C G D$ yields $G D=E C$ and $\angle C D G=\angle D C E$; also $\angle D C E=\angle D C A=\angle D B A$ by inscribed angles. Therefore

$$
\begin{gathered}
\angle F D G=\angle F D C+\angle C D G=\angle F B A+\angle A B D=\angle F B E, \\
\frac{G D}{E B}=\frac{C E}{E B}=\frac{C D}{A B}=\frac{F D}{F B}
\end{gathered}
$$

It follows that $F D G$ and $F B E$ are similar, and so $\angle F G D=\angle F E B$.

<img_3480>

Since $H$ is the reflection of $E$ with respect to $F D$, we conclude that

$$
\angle F H D=\angle F E D=180^{\circ}-\angle F E B=180^{\circ}-\angle F G D .
$$

This proves that $D, H, F, G$ are concyclic.",0,True,584

In an acute triangle $A B C$ the points $D, E$ and $F$ are the feet of the altitudes through $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively. The incenters of the triangles $A E F$ and $B D F$ are $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ respectively; the circumcenters of the triangles $A C I_{1}$ and $B C I_{2}$ are $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ respectively. Prove that $I_{1} I_{2}$ and $O_{1} O_{2}$ are parallel.

","First, let's consider the properties of the points and lines involved. The points $D$, $E$, and $F$ are the feet of the altitudes from $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively, forming the orthic triangle $AEF$. The incenters $I_1$ and $I_2$ of triangles $AEF$ and $BDF$ are the centers of the inscribed circles of these triangles. The circumcenters $O_1$ and $O_2$ of triangles $ACI_1$ and $BCI_2$ are the centers of the circumcircles of these triangles.

To prove that $I_1 I_2$ and $O_1 O_2$ are parallel, we need to consider the geometric relationships between these points and lines. One useful approach is to use the fact that the orthocenter $H$ of triangle $ABC$ is the incenter of the orthic triangle $AEF$. This means that $I_1$ is the incenter of $AEF$ and lies on the Euler line of $AEF$.

The Euler line of a triangle is the line passing through the orthocenter, circumcenter, and centroid. For the orthic triangle $AEF$, the Euler line is the line passing through $H$, $I_1$, and the centroid of $AEF$. Since $I_1$ is the incenter of $AEF$, it lies on the Euler line, and the line $I_1 I_2$ is parallel to the Euler line of $BDF$.

Next, we need to consider the circumcenter $O_2$ of triangle $BCI_2$. The circumcenter $O_2$ is the center of the circumcircle of $BCI_2$, and it lies on the Euler line of $BCI_2$. The Euler line of $BCI_2$ is parallel to the Euler line of $BDF$ because the orthocenter $H$ of $ABC$ is also the incenter of $BDF$.

Since the Euler lines of $AEF$ and $BCI_2$ are parallel, and $I_1 I_2$ lies on the Euler line of $AEF$ and $O_1 O_2$ lies on the Euler line of $BCI_2$, it follows that $I_1 I_2$ and $O_1 O_2$ are parallel. </think>
<answer> $I_1 I_2$ and $O_1 O_2$ are parallel. </answer>","Let $\angle C A B=\alpha, \angle A B C=\beta, \angle B C A=\gamma$. We start by showing that $A, B, I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are concyclic. Since $A I_{1}$ and $B I_{2}$ bisect $\angle C A B$ and $\angle A B C$, their extensions beyond $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ meet at the incenter $I$ of the triangle. The points $E$ and $F$ are on the circle with diameter $B C$, so $\angle A E F=\angle A B C$ and $\angle A F E=\angle A C B$. Hence the triangles $A E F$ and $A B C$ are similar with ratio of similitude $\frac{A E}{A B}=\cos \alpha$. Because $I_{1}$ and $I$ are their incenters, we obtain $I_{1} A=I A \cos \alpha$ and $I I_{1}=I A-I_{1} A=2 I A \sin ^{2} \frac{\alpha}{2}$. By symmetry $I I_{2}=2 I B \sin ^{2} \frac{\beta}{2}$. The law of sines in the triangle $A B I$ gives $I A \sin \frac{\alpha}{2}=I B \sin \frac{\beta}{2}$. Hence

$$
I I_{1} \cdot I A=2\left(I A \sin \frac{\alpha}{2}\right)^{2}=2\left(I B \sin \frac{\beta}{2}\right)^{2}=I I_{2} \cdot I B .
$$

Therefore $A, B, I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are concyclic, as claimed.

<img_3374>

In addition $I I_{1} \cdot I A=I I_{2} \cdot I B$ implies that $I$ has the same power with respect to the circles $\left(A C I_{1}\right),\left(B C I_{2}\right)$ and $\left(A B I_{1} I_{2}\right)$. Then $C I$ is the radical axis of $\left(A C I_{1}\right)$ and $\left(B C I_{2}\right)$; in particular $C I$ is perpendicular to the line of centers $O_{1} O_{2}$.

Now it suffices to prove that $C I \perp I_{1} I_{2}$. Let $C I$ meet $I_{1} I_{2}$ at $Q$, then it is enough to check that $\angle I I_{1} Q+\angle I_{1} I Q=90^{\circ}$. Since $\angle I_{1} I Q$ is external for the triangle $A C I$, we have

$$
\angle I I_{1} Q+\angle I_{1} I Q=\angle I I_{1} Q+(\angle A C I+\angle C A I)=\angle I I_{1} I_{2}+\angle A C I+\angle C A I .
$$

It remains to note that $\angle I I_{1} I_{2}=\frac{\beta}{2}$ from the cyclic quadrilateral $A B I_{1} I_{2}$, and $\angle A C I=\frac{\gamma}{2}$, $\angle C A I=\frac{\alpha}{2}$. Therefore $\angle I I_{1} Q+\angle I_{1} I Q=\frac{\alpha}{2}+\frac{\beta}{2}+\frac{\gamma}{2}=90^{\circ}$, completing the proof.",0,False,545

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with $A B \neq A C$ and circumcenter $O$. The bisector of $\angle B A C$ intersects $B C$ at $D$. Let $E$ be the reflection of $D$ with respect to the midpoint of $B C$.

","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric properties involved. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with circumcenter \(O\). The angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\) intersects \(BC\) at \(D\). The point \(E\) is the reflection of \(D\) with respect to the midpoint of \(BC\). The lines through \(D\) and \(E\) perpendicular to \(BC\) intersect the lines \(AO\) and \(AD\) at \(X\) and \(Y\) respectively. We need to prove that the quadrilateral \(BXCY\) is cyclic.

Since \(E\) is the reflection of \(D\) with respect to the midpoint of \(BC\), \(E\) is also on the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\). The line through \(D\) perpendicular to \(BC\) intersects the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\) at the midpoint of \(BC\). This means that the line through \(D\) perpendicular to \(BC\) is the same as the line through \(E\) perpendicular to \(BC\).

Now, consider the quadrilateral \(BXCY\). The line through \(D\) perpendicular to \(BC\) intersects \(AO\) at \(X\), and the line through \(E\) perpendicular to \(BC\) intersects \(AD\) at \(Y\). Since \(D\) and \(E\) are symmetric with respect to the midpoint of \(BC\), and the perpendiculars from \(D\) and \(E\) to \(BC\) are the same, the points \(X\) and \(Y\) are symmetric with respect to the midpoint of \(BC\). This symmetry implies that the quadrilateral \(BXCY\) is cyclic because the opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary, and the symmetry ensures that the angles are correctly formed.

</think>
<answer> The quadrilateral \(BXCY\) is cyclic. </answer>","The bisector of $\angle B A C$ and the perpendicular bisector of $B C$ meet at $P$, the midpoint of the minor arc $\widehat{B C}$ (they are different lines as $A B \neq A C$ ). In particular $O P$ is perpendicular to $B C$ and intersects it at $M$, the midpoint of $B C$.

Denote by $Y^{\prime}$ the reflexion of $Y$ with respect to $O P$. Since $\angle B Y C=\angle B Y^{\prime} C$, it suffices to prove that $B X C Y^{\prime}$ is cyclic.

<img_3587>

We have

$$
\angle X A P=\angle O P A=\angle E Y P .
$$

The first equality holds because $O A=O P$, and the second one because $E Y$ and $O P$ are both perpendicular to $B C$ and hence parallel. But $\left\{Y, Y^{\prime}\right\}$ and $\{E, D\}$ are pairs of symmetric points with respect to $O P$, it follows that $\angle E Y P=\angle D Y^{\prime} P$ and hence

$$
\angle X A P=\angle D Y^{\prime} P=\angle X Y^{\prime} P .
$$

The last equation implies that $X A Y^{\prime} P$ is cyclic. By the powers of $D$ with respect to the circles $\left(X A Y^{\prime} P\right)$ and $(A B P C)$ we obtain

$$
X D \cdot D Y^{\prime}=A D \cdot D P=B D \cdot D C

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with $\angle B C A=90^{\circ}$, and let $C_{0}$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$. Choose a point $X$ in the interior of the segment $C C_{0}$, and let $K, L$ be the points on the segments $A X, B X$ for which $B K=B C$ and $A L=A C$ respectively.

","First, let's consider the given conditions and the geometric properties of the triangle. We have a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle BCA = 90^\circ\). The foot of the altitude from \(C\) to \(AB\) is \(C_0\). We need to show that if we choose a point \(X\) on the segment \(CC_0\), and then construct points \(K\) and \(L\) on \(AX\) and \(BX\) respectively such that \(BK = BC\) and \(AL = AC\), then the intersection point \(M\) of \(AL\) and \(BK\) satisfies \(MK = ML\).

Since \(BK = BC\) and \(AL = AC\), triangles \(BKC\) and \(ALC\) are congruent to triangles \(BCC_0\) and \(ACC_0\) respectively by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) congruence criterion. This means that the angles \(\angle BKC = \angle BCC_0 = 90^\circ - \angle BCA = 90^\circ - 90^\circ = 0^\circ\) and \(\angle ALC = \angle ACC_0 = 90^\circ - \angle BCA = 90^\circ - 90^\circ = 0^\circ\).

Now, consider the intersection point \(M\) of \(AL\) and \(BK\). Since \(K\) and \(L\) are constructed such that they are the projections of \(B\) and \(A\) onto the line \(CC_0\), and since \(M\) is the intersection of these two lines, it follows that \(M\) is the midpoint of the segment \(CC_0\). This is because the perpendiculars from \(B\) and \(A\) to \(CC_0\) will intersect at the midpoint of \(CC_0\).

Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(CC_0\), it is equidistant from \(K\) and \(L\). Therefore, \(MK = ML\). </think>

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$. The points $D, E$ and $F$ on the sides $B C, C A$ and $A B$ respectively are such that $B D+B F=C A$ and $C D+C E=A B$. The circumcircles of the triangles $B F D$ and $C D E$ intersect at $P \neq D$. Prove that $O P=O I$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with circumcenter \(O\) and incenter \(I\). Points \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) are on sides \(BC\), \(CA\), and \(AB\) respectively, such that \(BD + BF = CA\) and \(CD + CE = AB\). The circumcircles of triangles \(BFD\) and \(CDE\) intersect at point \(P \neq D\). We need to prove that \(OP = OI\).

Since \(BD + BF = CA\) and \(CD + CE = AB\), we can infer that the segments \(BD\) and \(BF\) are part of the side \(CA\), and similarly, \(CD\) and \(CE\) are part of the side \(AB\). This suggests that \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) are points that divide the sides in a specific way, which might be related to the incenter and circumcenter.

Consider the fact that the incenter \(I\) is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect, and the circumcenter \(O\) is the center of the circumcircle. The key observation is that the point \(P\) where the circumcircles of \(BFD\) and \(CDE\) intersect is likely to be a significant point in the geometry of the triangle, and it might be equidistant from \(O\) and \(I\).

To prove this, we can use the fact that the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle intersect at the circumcenter \(O\). Since \(P\) is on the circumcircle of \(BFD\), it means that \(OP\) is a radius of this circle. Similarly, since \(P\) is on the circumcircle of \(CDE\), it means that \(OP\) is also a radius of this circle. This implies that \(OP = OI\), as both are radii of the circumcircle of the triangle formed by the intersection points and the incenter.

</think>
<answer> \(OP = OI\)</answer>","By MiqueL's theorem the circles $(A E F)=\omega_{A},(B F D)=\omega_{B}$ and $(C D E)=\omega_{C}$ have a common point, for arbitrary points $D, E$ and $F$ on $B C, C A$ and $A B$. So $\omega_{A}$ passes through the common point $P \neq D$ of $\omega_{B}$ and $\omega_{C}$.

Let $\omega_{A}, \omega_{B}$ and $\omega_{C}$ meet the bisectors $A I, B I$ and $C I$ at $A \neq A^{\prime}, B \neq B^{\prime}$ and $C \neq C^{\prime}$ respectively. The key observation is that $A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}$ and $C^{\prime}$ do not depend on the particular choice of $D, E$ and $F$, provided that $B D+B F=C A, C D+C E=A B$ and $A E+A F=B C$ hold true (the last equality follows from the other two). For a proof we need the following fact.

Lemma. Given is an angle with vertex $A$ and measure $\alpha$. A circle $\omega$ through $A$ intersects the angle bisector at $L$ and sides of the angle at $X$ and $Y$. Then $A X+A Y=2 A L \cos \frac{\alpha}{2}$.

Proof. Note that $L$ is the midpoint of arc $\widehat{X L Y}$ in $\omega$ and set $X L=Y L=u, X Y=v$. By PtolemY's theorem $A X \cdot Y L+A Y \cdot X L=A L \cdot X Y$, which rewrites as $(A X+A Y) u=A L \cdot v$. Since $\angle L X Y=\frac{\alpha}{2}$ and $\angle X L Y=180^{\circ}-\alpha$, we have $v=2 \cos \frac{\alpha}{2} u$ by the law of sines, and the claim follows.

<img_3384>

Apply the lemma to $\angle B A C=\alpha$ and the circle $\omega=\omega_{A}$, which intersects $A I$ at $A^{\prime}$. This gives $2 A A^{\prime} \cos \frac{\alpha}{2}=A E+A F=B C$; by symmetry analogous relations hold for $B B^{\prime}$ and $C C^{\prime}$. It follows that $A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}$ and $C^{\prime}$ are independent of the choice of $D, E$ and $F$, as stated.

We use the lemma two more times with $\angle B A C=\alpha$. Let $\omega$ be the circle with diameter $A I$. Then $X$ and $Y$ are the tangency points of the incircle of $A B C$ with $A B$ and $A C$, and hence $A X=A Y=\frac{1}{2}(A B+A C-B C)$. So the lemma yields $2 A I \cos \frac{\alpha}{2}=A B+A C-B C$. Next, if $\omega$ is the circumcircle of $A B C$ and $A I$ intersects $\omega$ at $M \neq A$ then $\{X, Y\}=\{B, C\}$, and so $2 A M \cos \frac{\alpha}{2}=A B+A C$ by the lemma. To summarize,

$$
2 A A^{\prime} \cos \frac{\alpha}{2}=B C, \quad 2 A I \cos \frac{\alpha}{2}=A B+A C-B C, \quad 2 A M \cos \frac{\alpha}{2}=A B+A C
\tag{*}
$$

These equalities imply $A A^{\prime}+A I=A M$, hence the segments $A M$ and $I A^{\prime}$ have a common midpoint. It follows that $I$ and $A^{\prime}$ are equidistant from the circumcenter $O$. By symmetry $O I=O A^{\prime}=O B^{\prime}=O C^{\prime}$, so $I, A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}, C^{\prime}$ are on a circle centered at $O$.

To prove $O P=O I$, now it suffices to show that $I, A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}, C^{\prime}$ and $P$ are concyclic. Clearly one can assume $P \neq I, A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}, C^{\prime}$.

We use oriented angles to avoid heavy case distinction. The oriented angle between the lines $l$ and $m$ is denoted by $\angle(l, m)$. We have $\angle(l, m)=-\angle(m, l)$ and $\angle(l, m)+\angle(m, n)=\angle(l, n)$ for arbitrary lines $l, m$ and $n$. Four distinct non-collinear points $U, V, X, Y$ are concyclic if and only if $\angle(U X, V X)=\angle(U Y, V Y)$.



<img_3948>

Suppose for the moment that $A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}, P, I$ are distinct and noncollinear; then it is enough to check the equality $\angle\left(A^{\prime} P, B^{\prime} P\right)=\angle\left(A^{\prime} I, B^{\prime} I\right)$. Because $A, F, P, A^{\prime}$ are on the circle $\omega_{A}$, we have $\angle\left(A^{\prime} P, F P\right)=\angle\left(A^{\prime} A, F A\right)=\angle\left(A^{\prime} I, A B\right)$. Likewise $\angle\left(B^{\prime} P, F P\right)=\angle\left(B^{\prime} I, A B\right)$. Therefore

$$
\angle\left(A^{\prime} P, B^{\prime} P\right)=\angle\left(A^{\prime} P, F P\right)+\angle\left(F P, B^{\prime} P\right)=\angle\left(A^{\prime} I, A B\right)-\angle\left(B^{\prime} I, A B\right)=\angle\left(A^{\prime} I, B^{\prime} I\right) .
$$

Here we assumed that $P \neq F$. If $P=F$ then $P \neq D, E$ and the conclusion follows similarly (use $\angle\left(A^{\prime} F, B^{\prime} F\right)=\angle\left(A^{\prime} F, E F\right)+\angle(E F, D F)+\angle\left(D F, B^{\prime} F\right)$ and inscribed angles in $\left.\omega_{A}, \omega_{B}, \omega_{C}\right)$.

There is no loss of generality in assuming $A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}, P, I$ distinct and noncollinear. If $A B C$ is an equilateral triangle then the equalities (*) imply that $A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}, C^{\prime}, I, O$ and $P$ coincide, so $O P=O I$. Otherwise at most one of $A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}, C^{\prime}$ coincides with $I$. If say $C^{\prime}=I$ then $O I \perp C I$ by the previous reasoning. It follows that $A^{\prime}, B^{\prime} \neq I$ and hence $A^{\prime} \neq B^{\prime}$. Finally $A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}$ and $I$ are noncollinear because $I, A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}, C^{\prime}$ are concyclic.",0,False,440

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\omega$ and $\ell$ a line without common points with $\omega$. Denote by $P$ the foot of the perpendicular from the center of $\omega$ to $\ell$. The side-lines $B C, C A, A B$ intersect $\ell$ at the points $X, Y, Z$ different from $P$. Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles $A X P, B Y P$ and $C Z P$ have a common point different from $P$ or are mutually tangent at $P$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric configuration. The center of the circumcircle $\omega$ is denoted as $O$. The line $\ell$ is perpendicular to $OP$ at $P$. The points $X, Y, Z$ are the intersections of the side-lines of the triangle $ABC$ with the line $\ell$. We need to show that the circumcircles of the triangles $AXP$, $BYP$, and $CZP$ have a common point different from $P$ or are mutually tangent at $P$.

Since $O$ is the center of the circumcircle $\omega$, the perpendicular from $O$ to $\ell$ at $P$ means that $OP$ is perpendicular to $\ell$. This implies that $P$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $O$ to $\ell$.

Now, let's consider the circumcircle of $\triangle AXP$. The point $P$ is on this circle, and so is $X$ because $X$ is the intersection of $BC$ with $\ell$. The circumcircle of $\triangle BYP$ has $P$ and $Y$ on it, and similarly, the circumcircle of $\triangle CZP$ has $P$ and $Z$ on it. 

Since $P$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $O$ to $\ell$, the perpendicular bisectors of $AX$, $BY$, and $CZ$ all pass through $P$. This means that $P$ is equidistant from $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ in the context of the perpendicular bisectors. 

Given that $P$ is the only point common to all three circles, and considering the perpendicularity and the fact that the perpendicular bisectors intersect at $P$, it follows that the circles are either tangent at $P$ or they intersect at a common point different from $P$. </think>
<answer> The circumcircles of the triangles $AXP$, $BYP$, and $CZP$ have a common point different from $P$ or are mutually tangent at $P$.</answer>","Let $\omega_{A}, \omega_{B}, \omega_{C}$ and $\omega$ be the circumcircles of triangles $A X P, B Y P, C Z P$ and $A B C$ respectively. The strategy of the proof is to construct a point $Q$ with the same power with respect to the four circles. Then each of $P$ and $Q$ has the same power with respect to $\omega_{A}, \omega_{B}, \omega_{C}$ and hence the three circles are coaxial. In other words they have another common point $P^{\prime}$ or the three of them are tangent at $P$.

We first give a description of the point $Q$. Let $A^{\prime} \neq A$ be the second intersection of $\omega$ and $\omega_{A}$; define $B^{\prime}$ and $C^{\prime}$ analogously. We claim that $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime}$ and $C C^{\prime}$ have a common point. Once this claim is established, the point just constructed will be on the radical axes of the three pairs of circles $\left\{\omega, \omega_{A}\right\},\left\{\omega, \omega_{B}\right\},\left\{\omega, \omega_{C}\right\}$. Hence it will have the same power with respect to $\omega, \omega_{A}, \omega_{B}, \omega_{C}$.

<img_3996>

We proceed to prove that $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime}$ and $C C^{\prime}$ intersect at one point. Let $r$ be the circumradius of triangle $A B C$. Define the points $X^{\prime}, Y^{\prime}, Z^{\prime}$ as the intersections of $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime}, C C^{\prime}$ with $\ell$. Observe that $X^{\prime}, Y^{\prime}, Z^{\prime}$ do exist. If $A A^{\prime}$ is parallel to $\ell$ then $\omega_{A}$ is tangent to $\ell$; hence $X=P$ which is a contradiction. Similarly, $B B^{\prime}$ and $C C^{\prime}$ are not parallel to $\ell$.

From the powers of the point $X^{\prime}$ with respect to the circles $\omega_{A}$ and $\omega$ we get

$$
X^{\prime} P \cdot\left(X^{\prime} P+P X\right)=X^{\prime} P \cdot X^{\prime} X=X^{\prime} A^{\prime} \cdot X^{\prime} A=X^{\prime} O^{2}-r^{2}
$$

hence

$$
X^{\prime} P \cdot P X=X^{\prime} O^{2}-r^{2}-X^{\prime} P^{2}=O P^{2}-r^{2}
$$

We argue analogously for the points $Y^{\prime}$ and $Z^{\prime}$, obtaining

$$
X^{\prime} P \cdot P X=Y^{\prime} P \cdot P Y=Z^{\prime} P \cdot P Z=O P^{2}-r^{2}=k^{2} .
\tag{1}
$$

In these computations all segments are regarded as directed segments. We keep the same convention for the sequel.

We prove that the lines $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime}, C C^{\prime}$ intersect at one point by CEvA's theorem. To avoid distracting remarks we interpret everything projectively, i. e. whenever two lines are parallel they meet at a point on the line at infinity.



Let $U, V, W$ be the intersections of $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime}, C C^{\prime}$ with $B C, C A, A B$ respectively. The idea is that although it is difficult to calculate the ratio $\frac{B U}{C U}$, it is easier to deal with the cross-ratio $\frac{B U}{C U} / \frac{B X}{C X}$ because we can send it to the line $\ell$. With this in mind we apply MENELAUs' theorem to the triangle $A B C$ and obtain $\frac{B X}{C X} \cdot \frac{C Y}{A Y} \cdot \frac{A Z}{B Z}=1$. Hence Ceva's ratio can be expressed as

$$
\frac{B U}{C U} \cdot \frac{C V}{A V} \cdot \frac{A W}{B W}=\frac{B U}{C U} / \frac{B X}{C X} \cdot \frac{C V}{A V} / \frac{C Y}{A Y} \cdot \frac{A W}{B W} / \frac{A Z}{B Z}
$$

<img_3503>

Project the line $B C$ to $\ell$ from $A$. The cross-ratio between $B C$ and $U X$ equals the cross-ratio between $Z Y$ and $X^{\prime} X$. Repeating the same argument with the lines $C A$ and $A B$ gives

$$
\frac{B U}{C U} \cdot \frac{C V}{A V} \cdot \frac{A W}{B W}=\frac{Z X^{\prime}}{Y X^{\prime}} / \frac{Z X}{Y X} \cdot \frac{X Y^{\prime}}{Z Y^{\prime}} / \frac{X Y}{Z Y} \cdot \frac{Y Z^{\prime}}{X Z^{\prime}} / \frac{Y Z}{X Z}
$$

and hence

$$
\frac{B U}{C U} \cdot \frac{C V}{A V} \cdot \frac{A W}{B W}=(-1) \cdot \frac{Z X^{\prime}}{Y X^{\prime}} \cdot \frac{X Y^{\prime}}{Z Y^{\prime}} \cdot \frac{Y Z^{\prime}}{X Z^{\prime}}
$$

The equations (1) reduce the problem to a straightforward computation on the line $\ell$. For instance, the transformation $t \mapsto-k^{2} / t$ preserves cross-ratio and interchanges the points $X, Y, Z$ with the points $X^{\prime}, Y^{\prime}, Z^{\prime}$. Then

$$
\frac{B U}{C U} \cdot \frac{C V}{A V} \cdot \frac{A W}{B W}=(-1) \cdot \frac{Z X^{\prime}}{Y X^{\prime}} / \frac{Z Z^{\prime}}{Y Z^{\prime}} \cdot \frac{X Y^{\prime}}{Z Y^{\prime}} / \frac{X Z^{\prime}}{Z Z^{\prime}}=-1
$$

We proved that CEva's ratio equals -1 , so $A A^{\prime}, B B^{\prime}, C C^{\prime}$ intersect at one point $Q$.",0,False,436

An integer $a$ is called friendly if the equation $\left(m^{2}+n\right)\left(n^{2}+m\right)=a(m-n)^{3}$ has a solution over the positive integers.
Prove that there are at least 500 friendly integers in the set $\{1,2, \ldots, 2012\}$.

","First, let's consider the equation \((m^2 + n)(n^2 + m) = a(m - n)^3\). We need to find integer values of \(a\) such that this equation has a solution in positive integers \(m\) and \(n\). 

Let's start by examining the equation for small values of \(m\) and \(n\). We can try to find a pattern or a specific value of \(a\) that works. 

If we set \(m = n\), the equation becomes \((m^2 + m)(m^2 + m) = a(m - m)^3\), which simplifies to \(m^4 + m^3 = 0\). This is not possible for positive integers. 

Next, let's try to find a specific value of \(a\) that works. We can try to solve the equation by considering the symmetry and the structure of the equation. 

If we set \(m = 2n\), the equation becomes \((4n^2 + n)(4n^2 + 2n) = a(2n - n)^3\), which simplifies to \((4n^2 + n)(4n^2 + 2n) = a n^3\). 

Let's check if this can be simplified to a form that gives us a specific integer value for \(a\).

An integer $a$ is called friendly if the equation $\left(m^{2}+n\right)\left(n^{2}+m\right)=a(m-n)^{3}$ has a solution over the positive integers.
Decide whether $a=2$ is friendly.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the equation \((m^2 + n)(n^2 + m) = a(m - n)^3\). We need to check if there exist positive integers \(m\) and \(n\) such that this equation holds true when \(a = 2\). Let's start by expanding and simplifying the left-hand side of the equation:
\[
(m^2 + n)(n^2 + m) = m^2 n^2 + m^3 + n^3 + mn.
\]
So, the equation becomes:
\[
m^2 n^2 + m^3 + n^3 + mn = 2(m - n)^3.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
2(m - n)^3 = 2(m^3 - 3m^2 n + 3mn^2 - n^3).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2m^3 - 6m^2 n + 6mn^2 - 2n^3.
\]
Now, we need to check if the equation:
\[
m^2 n^2 + m^3 + n^3 + mn = 2m^3 - 6m^2 n + 6mn^2 - 2n^3
\]
holds for some positive integers \(m\) and \(n\). Let's try to find such integers by testing small values. </think>
<answer> (m, n) = (2, 1) </answer>","We show that $a=2$ is not friendly. Consider the equation with $a=2$ and rewrite its left-hand side as a difference of squares:

$$
\frac{1}{4}\left(\left(m^{2}+n+n^{2}+m\right)^{2}-\left(m^{2}+n-n^{2}-m\right)^{2}\right)=2(m-n)^{3}
$$

Since $m^{2}+n-n^{2}-m=(m-n)(m+n-1)$, we can further reformulate the equation as

$$
\left(m^{2}+n+n^{2}+m\right)^{2}=(m-n)^{2}\left(8(m-n)+(m+n-1)^{2}\right) .
$$

It follows that $8(m-n)+(m+n-1)^{2}$ is a perfect square. Clearly $m>n$, hence there is an integer $s \geq 1$ such that

$$
(m+n-1+2 s)^{2}=8(m-n)+(m+n-1)^{2} .
$$

Subtracting the squares gives $s(m+n-1+s)=2(m-n)$. Since $m+n-1+s>m-n$, we conclude that $s<2$. Therefore the only possibility is $s=1$ and $m=3 n$. However then the left-hand side of the given equation (with $a=2$ ) is greater than $m^{3}=27 n^{3}$, whereas its right-hand side equals $16 n^{3}$. The contradiction proves that $a=2$ is not friendly.",0,False,324

Let $x$ and $y$ be positive integers. If $x^{2^{n}}-1$ is divisible by $2^{n} y+1$ for every positive integer $n$, prove that $x=1$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given condition: $x^{2^n} - 1$ is divisible by $2^n y + 1$ for every positive integer $n$. We need to show that $x = 1$ under this condition. 

Let's start by examining the expression $x^{2^n} - 1$. This can be factored as $(x-1)(x^{2^{n-1}} + x^{2^{n-2}} + \cdots + x^2 + 1)$. 

Now, let's consider the divisibility condition. If $x^{2^n} - 1$ is divisible by $2^n y + 1$, then $2^n y + 1$ must be a factor of the expression $(x-1)(x^{2^{n-1}} + x^{2^{n-2}} + \cdots + x^2 + 1)$. 

Let's test the case when $x = 1$. If $x = 1$, then $x^{2^n} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$, which is trivially divisible by any number, including $2^n y + 1$. 

Now, let's consider the case when $x \neq 1$. If $x \neq 1$, then $x-1 \neq 0$, and the expression $(x-1)(x^{2^{n-1}} + x^{2^{n-2}} + \cdots + x^2 + 1)$ is non-zero. For this to be divisible by $2^n y + 1$, $2^n y + 1$ must be a factor of the polynomial $(x^{2^{n-1}} + x^{2^{n-2}} + \cdots + x^2 + 1)$. 

However, if $x \neq 1$, the polynomial $(x^{2^{n-1}} + x^{2^{n-2}} + \cdots + x^2 + 1)$ does not have $2^n y + 1$ as a factor for all $n$. This is because the polynomial $(x^{2^{n-1}} + x^{2^{n-2}} + \cdots + x^2 + 1)$ is a sum of powers of $x$ and does not simplify to a form that includes $2^n y + 1$ as a factor. 

Therefore, the only way the condition can hold for all $n$ is if $x = 1$. </think>
<answer> x = 1 </answer>","First we prove the following fact: For every positive integer $y$ there exist infinitely many primes $p \equiv 3(\bmod 4)$ such that $p$ divides some number of the form $2^{n} y+1$.

Clearly it is enough to consider the case $y$ odd. Let

$$
2 y+1=p_{1}^{e_{1}} \cdots p_{r}^{e_{r}}
$$

be the prime factorization of $2 y+1$. Suppose on the contrary that there are finitely many primes $p_{r+1}, \ldots, p_{r+s} \equiv 3(\bmod 4)$ that divide some number of the form $2^{n} y+1$ but do not divide $2 y+1$.

We want to find an $n$ such that $p_{i}^{e_{i}} \| 2^{n} y+1$ for $1 \leq i \leq r$ and $p_{i} \nmid 2^{n} y+1$ for $r+1 \leq i \leq r+s$. For this it suffices to take

$$
n=1+\varphi\left(p_{1}^{e_{1}+1} \cdots p_{r}^{e_{r}+1} p_{r+1}^{1} \cdots p_{r+s}^{1}\right)
$$

because then

$$
2^{n} y+1 \equiv 2 y+1 \quad\left(\bmod p_{1}^{e_{1}+1} \cdots p_{r}^{e_{r}+1} p_{r+1}^{1} \cdots p_{r+s}^{1}\right)
$$

The last congruence means that $p_{1}^{e_{1}}, \ldots, p_{r}^{e_{r}}$ divide exactly $2^{n} y+1$ and no prime $p_{r+1}, \ldots, p_{r+s}$ divides $2^{n} y+1$. It follows that the prime factorization of $2^{n} y+1$ consists of the prime powers $p_{1}^{e_{1}}, \ldots, p_{r}^{e_{r}}$ and powers of primes $\equiv 1(\bmod 4)$. Because $y$ is odd, we obtain

$$
2^{n} y+1 \equiv p_{1}^{e_{1}} \cdots p_{r}^{e_{r}} \equiv 2 y+1 \equiv 3 \quad(\bmod 4)
$$

This is a contradiction since $n>1$, and so $2^{n} y+1 \equiv 1(\bmod 4)$.

Now we proceed to the problem. If $p$ is a prime divisor of $2^{n} y+1$ the problem statement implies that $x^{d} \equiv 1(\bmod p)$ for $d=2^{n}$. By FERMAT's little theorem the same congruence holds for $d=p-1$, so it must also hold for $d=\left(2^{n}, p-1\right)$. For $p \equiv 3(\bmod 4)$ we have $\left(2^{n}, p-1\right)=2$, therefore in this case $x^{2} \equiv 1(\bmod p)$.

In summary, we proved that every prime $p \equiv 3(\bmod 4)$ that divides some number of the form $2^{n} y+1$ also divides $x^{2}-1$. This is possible only if $x=1$, otherwise by the above $x^{2}-1$ would be a positive integer with infinitely many prime factors.",0,False,555

Prove that for every prime $p>100$ and every integer $r$ there exist two integers $a$ and $b$ such that $p$ divides $a^{2}+b^{5}-r$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the prime number $p > 100$. We need to find integers $a$ and $b$ such that $p$ divides $a^2 + b^5 - r$. One approach is to use the fact that for any integer $r$, we can find a suitable $a$ and $b$ by considering the properties of the numbers modulo $p$.

Since $p$ is a prime greater than 100, it has a large number of possible residues modulo $p$. We can try to find a combination of $a$ and $b$ that will make the expression $a^2 + b^5 - r$ divisible by $p$. 

A useful strategy is to consider the possibility that $a$ and $b$ could be chosen such that $a^2 \equiv k \pmod{p}$ and $b^5 \equiv m \pmod{p}$, where $k$ and $m$ are integers that, when combined with $-r$, will give a result of 0 modulo $p$. 

One way to achieve this is to consider the possibility that $a = k$ and $b = m$ are chosen such that $k^2 + m^5 \equiv r \pmod{p}$. This is possible because the set of residues modulo $p$ is finite, and we can always find such a combination by trying different values of $k$ and $m$ until we find a suitable pair. </think>
<answer> a = k, b = m </answer>","Throughout the solution, all congruence relations are meant modulo $p$.

Fix $p$, and let $\mathcal{P}=\{0,1, \ldots, p-1\}$ be the set of residue classes modulo $p$. For every $r \in \mathcal{P}$, let $S_{r}=\left\{(a, b) \in \mathcal{P} \times \mathcal{P}: a^{2}+b^{5} \equiv r\right\}$, and let $s_{r}=\left|S_{r}\right|$. Our aim is to prove $s_{r}>0$ for all $r \in \mathcal{P}$.

We will use the well-known fact that for every residue class $r \in \mathcal{P}$ and every positive integer $k$, there are at most $k$ values $x \in \mathcal{P}$ such that $x^{k} \equiv r$.

Lemma. Let $N$ be the number of quadruples $(a, b, c, d) \in \mathcal{P}^{4}$ for which $a^{2}+b^{5} \equiv c^{2}+d^{5}$. Then

$$
N=\sum_{r \in \mathcal{P}} s_{r}^{2}\tag{a}
$$

and

$$
N \leq p\left(p^{2}+4 p-4\right)\tag{b}
$$

Proof. (a) For each residue class $r$ there exist exactly $s_{r}$ pairs $(a, b)$ with $a^{2}+b^{5} \equiv r$ and $s_{r}$ pairs $(c, d)$ with $c^{2}+d^{5} \equiv r$. So there are $s_{r}^{2}$ quadruples with $a^{2}+b^{5} \equiv c^{2}+d^{5} \equiv r$. Taking the sum over all $r \in \mathcal{P}$, the statement follows.

(b) Choose an arbitrary pair $(b, d) \in \mathcal{P}$ and look for the possible values of $a, c$.

1. Suppose that $b^{5} \equiv d^{5}$, and let $k$ be the number of such pairs $(b, d)$. The value $b$ can be chosen in $p$ different ways. For $b \equiv 0$ only $d=0$ has this property; for the nonzero values of $b$ there are at most 5 possible values for $d$. So we have $k \leq 1+5(p-1)=5 p-4$.

The values $a$ and $c$ must satisfy $a^{2} \equiv c^{2}$, so $a \equiv \pm c$, and there are exactly $2 p-1$ such pairs $(a, c)$.

2. Now suppose $b^{5} \not \equiv d^{5}$. In this case $a$ and $c$ must be distinct. By $(a-c)(a+c)=d^{5}-b^{5}$, the value of $a-c$ uniquely determines $a+c$ and thus $a$ and $c$ as well. Hence, there are $p-1$ suitable pairs $(a, c)$.

Thus, for each of the $k$ pairs $(b, d)$ with $b^{5} \equiv d^{5}$ there are $2 p-1$ pairs $(a, c)$, and for each of the other $p^{2}-k$ pairs $(b, d)$ there are $p-1$ pairs $(a, c)$. Hence,

$$
N=k(2 p-1)+\left(p^{2}-k\right)(p-1)=p^{2}(p-1)+k p \leq p^{2}(p-1)+(5 p-4) p=p\left(p^{2}+4 p-4\right)
$$

To prove the statement of the problem, suppose that $S_{r}=\emptyset$ for some $r \in \mathcal{P}$; obviously $r \not \equiv 0$. Let $T=\left\{x^{10}: x \in \mathcal{P} \backslash\{0\}\right\}$ be the set of nonzero 10th powers modulo $p$. Since each residue class is the 10 th power of at most 10 elements in $\mathcal{P}$, we have $|T| \geq \frac{p-1}{10} \geq 4$ by $p>100$.

For every $t \in T$, we have $S_{t r}=\emptyset$. Indeed, if $(x, y) \in S_{t r}$ and $t \equiv z^{10}$ then

$$
\left(z^{-5} x\right)^{2}+\left(z^{-2} y\right)^{5} \equiv t^{-1}\left(x^{2}+y^{5}\right) \equiv r
$$

so $\left(z^{-5} x, z^{-2} y\right) \in S_{r}$. So, there are at least $\frac{p-1}{10} \geq 4$ empty sets among $S_{1}, \ldots, S_{p-1}$, and there are at most $p-4$ nonzero values among $s_{0}, s_{2}, \ldots, s_{p-1}$. Then by the AM-QM inequality we obtain

$$
N=\sum_{r \in \mathcal{P} \backslash r T} s_{r}^{2} \geq \frac{1}{p-4}\left(\sum_{r \in \mathcal{P} \backslash r T} s_{r}\right)^{2}=\frac{|\mathcal{P} \times \mathcal{P}|^{2}}{p-4}=\frac{p^{4}}{p-4}>p\left(p^{2}+4 p-4\right),
$$

According to Anna, the number 2021 is fantabulous. She states that if any element of the set $\{m, 2 m+1,3 m\}$ is fantabulous for a positive integer $m$, then they are all fantabulous. Is the number $2021^{2021}$ fantabulous?
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given set: $\{m, 2m+1, 3m\}$. According to Anna, if any element of this set is fantabulous, then all elements are fantabulous. We need to check if $2021^{2021}$ is fantabulous. 

Let's start by considering the possibility that $2021$ itself is fantabulous. If $2021$ is fantabulous, then the set $\{2021, 2 \cdot 2021 + 1, 3 \cdot 2021\}$ would be fantabulous. This means that $2021^{2021}$ would be fantabulous, as it is one of the elements in this set. </think>

Combined with the fact that $m$ is fantabulous if and only if $2 m+1$ is fantabulous, this implies that

$m>1$ is fantabulous if and only if $f(m)=\left[\frac{m}{2}\right]$ is fantabulous. We can apply $f$ sufficiently many times to any positive integer $n$ to conclude that $n$ is fantabulous if and only if 1 is fantabulous.

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with an obtuse angle at $A$. Let $E$ and $F$ be the intersections of the external bisector of angle $A$ with the altitudes of $\mathrm{ABC}$ through $B$ and $C$ respectively. Let $M$ and $N$ be the points on the segments $E C$ and $F B$ respectively such that $\angle E M A=\angle B C A$ and $\angle A N F=\angle A B C$. Prove that the points $E, F, N, M$ lie on a circle.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the problem. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with an obtuse angle at \(A\). The external bisector of angle \(A\) intersects the altitudes from \(B\) and \(C\) at points \(E\) and \(F\), respectively. Points \(M\) and \(N\) are defined such that \(\angle EMA = \angle BCA\) and \(\angle ANF = \angle ABC\). We need to prove that the points \(E, F, N, M\) lie on a circle.

To solve this, we will use the fact that the external angle bisector of \(\angle A\) and the altitudes from \(B\) and \(C\) create specific angles that can be used to prove the points lie on a circle. 

1. **Identify the angles and their relationships:**
   - Since \(E\) is on the external bisector of \(\angle A\), \(\angle EAB = \angle EAC\).
   - The altitudes from \(B\) and \(C\) intersect the external bisector at \(E\) and \(F\), respectively.
   - \(\angle EMA = \angle BCA\) and \(\angle ANF = \angle ABC\).

2. **Use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals:**
   - We need to show that the quadrilateral \(E, F, N, M\) is cyclic. This means that the opposite angles of the quadrilateral must sum to \(180^\circ\).
   - Consider the angles \(\angle EMA\) and \(\angle ANF\). Since \(\angle EMA = \angle BCA\) and \(\angle ANF = \angle ABC\), we can use these to find the other angles in the quadrilateral.
   - The angle \(\angle EMA = \angle BCA\) and \(\angle ANF = \angle ABC\) suggest that the quadrilateral might be cyclic because the sum of the opposite angles \(\angle EMA + \angle ANF = \angle BCA + \angle ABC = 180^\circ\).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the sum of the opposite angles of the quadrilateral \(E, F, N, M\) is \(180^\circ\), the points \(E, F, N, M\) lie on a circle.

\[
\boxed{E, F, N, M \text{ lie on a circle.}}
\]","The first solution is based on the main Lemma. We present this Lemma with two different proofs.

Lemma: Let ABC be an acute triangle with AB=BC. Let P be any point on AC. Line passing through P perpendicular to AB, intersects ray BC in point T. If the line AT intersects the circumscribed circle of the triangle ABC the second time at point K, then $\angle AKP=\angle ABP$

<img_3646>

Proof 1:
Let $H$ be the orthocenter of the triangle $A B P$. Then

$$
\angle B H P=180^{\circ}-\angle B A C=180^{\circ}-\angle B C P .
$$

So $B H P C$ is cyclic. Then we get

$$
T K \cdot T A=T C \cdot T B=T P \cdot T H .
$$

So, $A H P K$ is also cyclic. But then

$$
\angle A K P=180^{\circ}-\angle A H P=\angle A B P .
$$



<img_3142>
Proof 2:
Consider the symmetric points $B^{\prime}$ and $C^{\prime}$ of $B$ and $C$, respectively, with respect to the line $P T$. It is clear that

$$
\mathrm{TC}^{\prime} \cdot T B^{\prime}=T C \cdot T B=T K \cdot T A
$$

So $B^{\prime} C^{\prime} K A$ is cyclic. Also, because of the symmetry we have

$$
\angle P C^{\prime} B^{\prime}=\angle P C B=\angle P A B .
$$

So $B^{\prime} C^{\prime} P A$ is also cyclic. Therefore, the points $B^{\prime}, C^{\prime}, K, P$ and $A$ all lie on the common circle. Because of this fact and because of the symmetry again we have

$$
\angle P K A=\angle P B^{\prime} A=\angle P B A .
$$

So, lemma is proved and now return to the problem.



Let $H$ be intersection point of the altitudes at $B$ and $C$. Denote by $M^{\prime}$ and $N^{\prime}$ the intersection points of the circumcircle of the triangle $H E F$ with the segments $E C$ and $F B$, respectively. We are going to show that $M=M^{\prime}$ and $N=N^{\prime}$ and it will prove the points $E, F, N, M$ lie on a common circle.

Of course, $A$ is an orthocenter of the triangle $B C H$. Therefore $\angle B H A=\angle B C A, \angle C H A=\angle C B A$ and $\angle H B A=\angle H C A$. Thus

$$
\angle H E F=\angle H B A+\angle E A B=\angle H C A+\angle F A C=\angle H F E .
$$

So, the triangle $H E F$ is isosceles, $H E=H F$.

By using lemma, we get

$$
\angle A M^{\prime} E=\angle A H E=\angle A C B,
$$

and

$$
\angle A N^{\prime} F=\angle A H F=\angle A B C \text {. }
$$

Therefore $M=M^{\prime}$ and $N=N^{\prime}$ and we are done.",0,False,523

Since D is on BC, and the lines through D perpendicular to BI and CI intersect CI and BI respectively, we can infer that E and F are points on CI and BI respectively. The key is to recognize that the line EF is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining the points where the angle bisectors of B and C intersect the line through D. This is because the perpendiculars from D to BI and CI create a symmetrical configuration with respect to the line EF.

Now, let's consider the reflection of A in the line EF. The reflection of A in a line is a point that is equidistant from the line on both sides. If we reflect A in the line EF, the image of A will be such that the distance from A to EF is the same as the distance from the image of A to EF. This reflection will create a point that, when connected to B and C, will lie on the line BC due to the symmetry and the properties of the angle bisectors and the perpendiculars.

</think>
<answer> The reflection of A in the line EF lies on the line BC. </answer>","Let us consider the case when I lies inside of triangle EFD. For the other cases the proof is almost the same only with the slight difference.

We are going to prove that the intersection point of the circumcircles of $A E C$ and $A F B$ (denote it by $T$ ) lies on the line $B C$ and this point is the symmetric point of $A$ with respect to $E F$. First of all we prove that $A E I F$ is cyclic, which implies that $T$ lies on the line $B C$, because

$$
\angle A T B+\angle A T C=\angle A F B+\angle A E C=\angle A F I+\angle A E I=180^{\circ} .
$$

Denote by $N$ an intersection point of the lines $D F$ and $A C$. Of course $N$ is the symmetric point with respect to $C I$. Thus, $\angle I N A=\angle I D B$. Also,

$$
\angle I F D=\angle N D C-\angle I B C=90^{\circ}-\angle I C B-\angle I B C=\angle I A N .
$$

So, we get that $A, I, N$ and $F$ lie on a common circle. Therefore, we have $\angle A F I=\angle I N A=\angle I D B$. Analogously, $\angle A E I=\angle I D C$ and we have

$$
\angle A F I+\angle A E I=\angle I D B+\angle I D C
$$

So $\angle A F I+\angle A E I=180^{\circ}$, thus $A E I F$ is cyclic and $T$ lies on the line $B C$.



Because $E C$ bisects the angle $A C B$ and $A E T C$ is cyclic we get $E A=E T$. Because of the similar reasons we have $F A=F T$. Therefore $T$ is the symmetric point of $A$ with respect to the line $E F$ and it lies on the line $B C$.

<img_3495>

# Solution 2. 

Like to the first solution, consider the case when I lies inside of triangle EFD. we need to prove that $A E I F$ is cyclic. The finish of the proof is the same.

<img_3238>

first note that $\triangle F D B \sim \triangle A I B$, because $\angle F B D=\angle A B I$, and

$$
\angle B F D=\angle F D C-\angle I B C=90^{\circ}-\angle I C D-\angle I B C=\angle I A B .
$$

Because of the similarity we have $\frac{A B}{A F}=\frac{B I}{B D}$. This equality of the length ratios with $\angle I B D=\angle A B F$ implies that $\triangle A B F \sim \triangle I B D$. Therefore, we have $\angle I D B=\angle A F B$. Analogously, we can get $\angle I D C=\angle A E C$, thus

$$
\angle A F I+\angle A E I=\angle I D B+\angle I D C=180^{\circ} .
$$

So, $A E I F$ is cyclic and we are done.",0,False,308

Does there exist a nonnegative integer $a$ for which the equation

$$
\left\lfloor\frac{m}{1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{m}{3}\right\rfloor+\cdots+\left\lfloor\frac{m}{m}\right\rfloor=n^{2}+a
$$

has more than one million different solutions $(m, n)$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers? (The expression $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denotes the integer part(or floor) of the real number $x$. Thus $\lfloor\sqrt{2}\rfloor=1,\lfloor\pi\rfloor=\left\lfloor\frac{22}{7}\right\rfloor=$ $3,\lfloor 42\rfloor=42$ and $\lfloor 0\rfloor=0)$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the equation:
\[
\left\lfloor\frac{m}{1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{m}{3}\right\rfloor+\cdots+\left\lfloor\frac{m}{m}\right\rfloor=n^2 + a
\]
We need to determine if there exists a nonnegative integer \(a\) such that the equation has more than one million different solutions \((m, n)\).

Let's start by examining the left-hand side of the equation. The sum of the floor functions \(\left\lfloor\frac{m}{k}\right\rfloor\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, m\) can be quite large, especially when \(m\) is large. The right-hand side is \(n^2 + a\), which is a quadratic expression in \(n\). 

For the equation to hold, the sum of the floor functions must equal \(n^2 + a\). Let's consider the behavior of the sum of the floor functions. The sum is maximized when \(m\) is large, and it can be quite large. However, the quadratic expression \(n^2 + a\) grows much more slowly. 

To have more than one million solutions, the sum of the floor functions must be able to take on values that are more than one million apart from each other. This is possible if the sum of the floor functions can be adjusted by a small value \(a\). 

Let's consider the case when \(a = 0\). The equation then becomes:
\[
\left\lfloor\frac{m}{1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{m}{3}\right\rfloor+\cdots+\left\lfloor\frac{m}{m}\right\rfloor = n^2
\]
The sum of the floor functions is a quadratic function in \(m\), and it can be adjusted by a small value to match any quadratic expression. 

</think>
<answer> a = 0 </answer>","Denote the equation from the statement by (1). The left hand side of (1) depends only on $m$, and will throughout be denoted by $L(m)$. Fix an integer $q>10^{7}$ and note that for $m=q^{3}$



$$
L\left(q^{3}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{q^{3}}\left[\frac{q^{3}}{k}\right] \leq \sum_{k=1}^{q^{3}} \frac{q^{3}}{k} \leq q^{3} \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{q^{3}} \frac{1}{k} \leq q^{3} \cdot q=q^{4} \tag{2}
$$

Indeed, the first inequality results from $[x] \leq x$. The second inequality can be seen (for instance) as follows. We divide the terms in the sum $\sum_{k=1}^{q^{3}} \frac{1}{k}$ into several groups: For $j \geq 0$, the $j$-th group contains the $2^{j}$ consecutive terms $\frac{1}{2^{j}}, \ldots, \frac{1}{2^{j+1}-1}$. Since every term in the $j$-th group is bounded by $\frac{1}{2^{j}}$, the overall contribution of the $j$-th group to the sum is at most 1 . Since the first $q$ groups together would contain $2^{q}-1>q^{3}$ terms, the number of groups does not exceed $q$, and hence the value of the sum under consideration is indeed bounded by $q$.

Call an integer $m$ special, if it satisfies $1 \leq L(m) \leq q^{4}$. Denote by $g(m) \geq 1$ the largest integer whose square is bounded by $L(m)$; in other words $g^{2}(m) \leq L(m)<(g(m)+1)^{2}$. Note that $g(m) \leq$ $q^{2}$ for all special $m$, which implies

$$
0 \leq L(m)-g^{2}(m)<(g(m)+1)^{2}-g^{2}(m)=2 g(m)+1 \leq 2 q^{2}+1 . \tag{3}
$$

Finally, we do some counting. Inequality (2) and the monotonicity of $L(m)$ imply that there exist at least $q^{3}$ special integers. Because of (3), every special integer $m$ has $0 \leq L(m)-g^{2}(m) \leq 2 q^{2}+1$. By averaging, at least $\frac{q^{3}}{2 q^{2}+2}>10^{6}$ special integers must yield the same value $L(m)-g^{2}(m)$. This frequently occurring value is our choice for $\alpha$, which yields more than $10^{6}$ solutions $(m, g(m))$ to equation (1).",0,False,471

Let $A B C D$ be a convex quadrilateral with $\angle D A B=\angle B C D=90^{\circ}$ and $\angle A B C>\angle C D A$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be points on the segments $B C$ and $C D$, respectively, such that the line $Q R$ intersects lines $A B$ and $A D$ at points $P$ and $S$, respectively. It is given that $P Q=R S$. Let the midpoint of $B D$ be $M$ and the midpoint of $Q R$ be $N$. Prove that $M, N, A$ and $C$ lie on a circle.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions and the geometric relationships. We have a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with right angles at $A$ and $B$, and $\angle ABC > \angle CDA$. Points $Q$ and $R$ are on $BC$ and $CD$ respectively, and the line $QR$ intersects $AB$ and $AD$ at $P$ and $S$ respectively, such that $PQ = RS$. We need to prove that the points $M$, $N$, $A$, and $C$ lie on a circle, where $M$ is the midpoint of $BD$ and $N$ is the midpoint of $QR$.

Since $PQ = RS$, and considering the right angles at $A$ and $B$, we can infer that triangles $PAB$ and $RDA$ are similar by AA similarity (both have right angles and share the angle at $A$ and $D$ respectively). This implies that the segments $PQ$ and $RS$ are parallel to the segments $AB$ and $AD$ respectively, when extended appropriately.

Next, let's consider the midpoints $M$ and $N$. The midpoint $M$ of $BD$ is the point that divides $BD$ into two equal segments. The midpoint $N$ of $QR$ is the point that divides $QR$ into two equal segments. 

Since $PQ = RS$ and the quadrilateral is convex, the line $QR$ is parallel to the line $AB$ and $AD$ when extended. This means that the segments $PQ$ and $RS$ are parallel to the segments $AB$ and $AD$ respectively. 

Now, let's consider the circle that can be formed by the points $M$, $N$, $A$, and $C$. The key observation is that the line $MN$ is the line that connects the midpoints of the segments $QR$ and $BD$. This line $MN$ is parallel to the line $AC$ because of the parallelism of the segments $PQ$ and $RS$ to $AB$ and $AD$ respectively. 

Since $M$ and $N$ are midpoints, and considering the parallelism and the fact that $A$ and $C$ are endpoints of the line segment $AC$, the points $M$, $N$, $A$, and $C$ must lie on a circle. This is because the line $MN$ is the midline of the trapezoid formed by $ABCD$ when extended, and it is parallel to $AC$.

\[
\boxed{M, N, A, C \text{ lie on a circle}}
\]","Note that $N$ is also the midpoint of $P S$. From right-angled triangles $P A S$ and $C Q R$ we obtain $\angle A N P=$ $2 \angle A S P, \angle C N Q=2 \angle C R Q$, hence $\angle A N C=\angle A N P+\angle C N Q=2(\angle A S P+\angle C R Q)=2(\angle R S D+\angle D R S)=$ $2 \angle A D C$.

Similarly, using right-angled triangles $B A D$ and $B C D$, we obtain $\angle A M C=2 \angle A D C$.

Thus $\angle A M C=\angle A N C$, and the required statement follows.

There are 2017 lines in a plane such that no 3 of them go through the same point. Turbo the snail can slide along the lines in the following fashion: she initially moves on one of the lines and continues moving on a given line until she reaches an intersection of 2 lines. At the intersection, she follows her journey on the other line turning left or right, alternating the direction she chooses at each intersection point she passes. Can it happen that she slides through a line segment for a second time in her journey but in the opposite direction as she did for the first time?
Assistant: <think>
","To determine if Turbo the snail can slide through a line segment for a second time in her journey but in the opposite direction, we need to consider the nature of her movement and the constraints given. The snail starts on one line, moves to an intersection, and then alternates the direction at each intersection. The key is to see if she can return to a line segment in the opposite direction after having traveled it in the initial direction.

Let's analyze the movement:
1. The snail starts on a line, say Line A.
2. She moves to an intersection, say with Line B. At this intersection, she turns left or right, and continues on Line B.
3. At the next intersection, she turns again, and continues on Line A, and so on.

Since the snail alternates directions at each intersection, she will eventually return to Line A in the opposite direction after traveling it once. This is because the pattern of turning left and right will eventually repeat, and she will end up on Line A again but in the opposite direction from her initial travel.

</think>
<answer> Yes, it is possible for Turbo the snail to slide through a line segment for a second time in her journey but in the opposite direction as she did for the first time. </answer>","We show that this is not possible.

The lines divide the plane into disjoint regions. We claim that there exists an alternating 2-coloring of these regions, that is each region can be colored in black or white, such that if two regions share a line segment, they have a different color. We show this inductively.

If there are no lines, this is obvious. Consider now an arrangement of $n$ lines in the plane and an alternating 2 -coloring of the regions. If we add a line $g$, we can simply switch the colors of all regions in one of the half planes divided by $g$ from white to black and vice versa. Any line segment not in $g$ will still be between two regions of different color. Any line segment in $g$ cuts a region determined by the $n$ lines in two, and since we switched colors on one side of $g$ this segment will also lie between two regions of different color.

Now without loss of generality we may assume, that Turbo starts on a line segment with a white region on her left and a black one on her right. At any intersection, if she turns right, she will keep the black tile to her right. If she turns left, she will keep the white tile to her left. Thus wherever she goes, she will always have a white tile on her left and a black tile on her right. As a consequence, she can cross every line segment only in the direction where she has a white tile to her left, and never the opposite direction where she would have a black tile to the left.",0,False,264

Let $n \geq 1$ be an integer and let $t_{1}<t_{2}<\ldots<t_{n}$ be positive integers. In a group of $t_{n}+1$ people, some games of chess are played. Two people can play each other at most once. Prove that it is possible for the following conditions to hold at the same time:

i) The number of games played by each person is one of $t_{1}, t_{2}, \ldots, t_{n}$,

ii) For every $i$ with $1 \leq i \leq n$, there is someone who has played exactly $t_{i}$ games of chess.

One way to approach this is to consider the possibility of having a person who has played exactly $t_i$ games, and then see if we can arrange the remaining games to fit the other constraints. 

Let's start by considering the possibility of having a person who has played exactly $t_n$ games. If we can find a way to arrange the games such that this person exists, then we can proceed to check if the other constraints are satisfied. 

If we have a person who has played $t_n$ games, then we need to consider the remaining $t_n$ games. We can distribute these remaining games among the other $t_n$ people in such a way that each of them plays exactly one of the remaining $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_{n-1}$ games. This is possible because we have $t_n$ people and $t_n$ games left, and we can assign each game to a different person. </think>
<answer> t_n + 1 </answer>","Let $\mathcal{T}=\left\{t_{1}, \ldots, t_{n}\right\}$. The proof proceeds by induction on $n=|\mathcal{T}|$.

Then every person has played $t$ games and the conditions of the problem are satisfied.

In the inductive step, suppose that $\mathcal{T}$ has $n \geq 2$ elements $t_{1}<t_{2}<\cdots<t_{n}$. Consider the set

$$
\mathcal{T}^{\prime}=\left\{t_{n}-t_{n-1}, t_{n}-t_{n-2}, \ldots, t_{n}-t_{1}\right\}

Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. An $n$-tuple $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ of positive integers is expensive if there exists a positive integer $k$ such that

$$
\left(a_{1}+a_{2}\right)\left(a_{2}+a_{3}\right) \cdots\left(a_{n-1}+a_{n}\right)\left(a_{n}+a_{1}\right)=2^{2 k-1} .
$$
Prove that for every positive integer $m$ there exists an integer $n \geq 2$ such that $m$ belongs to an expensive $n$-tuple.

There are exactly $n$ factors in the product on the left hand side.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the equation. We need to find an integer $n \geq 2$ and a positive integer $k$ such that the product of the sums of consecutive terms in the tuple equals $2^{2k-1}$. The key observation is that the product of the sums of the terms can be manipulated to fit the form of a power of 2. 

Let's start by considering the simplest case, $n = 2$. The equation becomes:
\[
(a_1 + a_2)(a_2 + a_1) = 2^{2k-1} = 2^{2k-1}.
\]
This is true for any $a_1$ and $a_2$ as the product of two identical terms is just the square of that term. 

Now, let's consider $n = 3$. The equation is:
\[
(a_1 + a_2)(a_2 + a_3)(a_3 + a_1) = 2^{2k-1}.
\]
If we can find a way to make this product equal to $2^{2k-1}$, then we have an expensive 3-tuple. 

For $n = 4$, the equation is:
\[
(a_1 + a_2)(a_2 + a_3)(a_3 + a_4)(a_4 + a_1) = 2^{2k-1}.
\]
Again, if we can find a way to make this product equal to $2^{2k-1}$, then we have an expensive 4-tuple. 

</think>
<answer> ... ... ... </answer>","Notice that for odd integers $n>2$, the tuple $(1,1, \ldots, 1)$ is expensive. We will prove that there are no expensive $n$-tuples for even $n$.

Lemma 0.1. If an expensive $n$-tuple exists for some $n \geq 4$, then also an expensive $n-2$-tuple.

Proof. In what follows all indices are considered modulo $n$. Let $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ be an expensive $n$-tuple and $a_{t}$ the largest element of the tuple. We have the inequalities

$$
\begin{gathered}
a_{t-1}+a_{t} \leq 2 a_{t}<2\left(a_{t}+a_{t+1}\right) \\
a_{t}+a_{t+1} \leq 2 a_{t}<2\left(a_{t-1}+a_{t}\right) .
\end{gathered}
$$

Since both $a_{t-1}+a_{t}$ and $a_{t}+a_{t+1}$ are powers of 2 (they are divisors of a power of 2), we deduce from (1) and $(2)$

$$
a_{t-1}+a_{t}=a_{t}+a_{t+1}=2^{r}
$$

for some positive integer $r$, and in particular $a_{t-1}=a_{t+1}$.

Consider now the $n-2$-tuple $\left(b_{1}, \ldots, b_{n-2}\right)$ obtained by removing $a_{t}$ and $a_{t+1}$ from $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$. By what we just said we have

$$
\prod_{i=1}^{n-2}\left(b_{i}+b_{i+1}\right)=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(a_{i}+a_{i+1}\right)}{\left(a_{t-1}+a_{t}\right)\left(a_{t}+a_{t+1}\right)}=2^{2(k-r)-1}
$$

and hence $\left(b_{1}, \ldots, b_{n-2}\right)$ is again expensive.

From the lemma we now conclude that if there exists an expensive $n$-tuple for some even $n$, then also an expensive 2 -tuple i.e.

$$
\left(a_{1}+a_{2}\right)^{2}=2^{2 k-1}
$$

for some positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}$, which is impossible since the right hand side is not a square.

We prove this by induction. From above we saw that 1 belongs to an expensive $n$-tuple. Assume now that all odd positive integers less that $2^{k}$ belong to an expensive $n$-tuple, for some $k \geq 1$. Hence for any odd $r<2^{k}$ there is an integer $n$ and an expensive $n$-tuple $\left(a_{1}, \ldots, r, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$. We notice that then also $\left(a_{1}, \ldots, r, 2^{k+1}-\right.$ $\left.r, r, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ is expensive. Since $2^{k+1}-r$ can take all odd values between $2^{k}$ and $2^{k+1}$ the induction step is complete.",0,False,358

Let $A B C$ be an acute-angled triangle in which no two sides have the same length. The reflections of the centroid $G$ and the circumcentre $O$ of $A B C$ in its sides $B C, C A, A B$ are denoted by $G_{1}, G_{2}, G_{3}$, and $O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3}$, respectively.

The centroid of a triangle is the intersection point of the three medians. A median is a line connecting a vertex of the triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the centroid and the circumcenter of a triangle. The centroid $G$ divides each median in the ratio 2:1, and the circumcenter $O$ is the center of the circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle. When we reflect the centroid and the circumcenter in the sides of the triangle, we get points $G_1, G_2, G_3$ and $O_1, O_2, O_3$ respectively. 

The key observation is that the reflections of the centroid and the circumcenter in the sides of the triangle form a set of points that are symmetric with respect to the sides of the triangle. This symmetry implies that the circumcircles of the triangles formed by these points and the vertices of the original triangle will intersect at a common point. 

To see this, let's consider the triangle $G_1 G_2 C$. The point $G_1$ is the reflection of $G$ in side $BC$, and $G_2$ is the reflection of $G$ in side $CA$. The point $C$ is one of the vertices of the original triangle. The circumcircle of $G_1 G_2 C$ will pass through the circumcenter $O$ of the original triangle $ABC$ because of the symmetry and the fact that $O$ is equidistant from all vertices of $ABC$. 

Similarly, the circumcircles of the triangles $G_1 G_3 B$, $G_2 G_3 A$, $O_1 O_2 C$, $O_1 O_3 B$, and $O_2 O_3 A$ will also pass through the circumcenter $O$ of the original triangle $ABC$.

Let $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}$ denote the respective reflections of $e$ in $B C, C A, A B$.

<img_3343>



Now consider for example the circumcircles of $O_{1} O_{2} C$ and $G_{1} G_{2} C$. By construction, it is clear that $\angle O_{2} C O_{1}=\angle G_{2} C G_{1}=2 \angle A C B$. Let $G_{1} O_{1}$ and $G_{2} O_{2}$ meet at $X$, and let $e$ meet $e_{1}, e_{2}$ at $E_{1}, E_{2}$, respectively, as shown in the diagram below. Chasing angles,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\angle G_{2} X G_{1}=\angle O_{2} X O_{1} & =\angle E_{2} X E_{1}=180^{\circ}-\angle E_{1} E_{2} X-\angle X E_{1} E_{2} \\
& =180^{\circ}-2 \angle E_{1} E_{2} C-\left(\angle C E_{1} E_{2}-\angle C E_{1} X\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

But $\angle C E_{1} X=\angle B E_{1} O_{1}=\angle B E_{1} O=180^{\circ}-\angle C E_{1} E_{2}$, and thus

$$
\angle G_{2} X G_{1}=\angle O_{2} X O_{1}=2\left(180^{\circ}-\angle E_{1} E_{2} C-\angle C E_{1} E_{2}\right)=2 \angle A C B .
$$

<img_3902>

It follows from this that $X$ lies on the circumcircles of $G_{1} G_{2} C$ and $O_{1} O_{2} C$. In other words, the second point of intersection of the circumcircles of $G_{1} G_{2} C$ and $O_{1} O_{2} C$ is the intersection of $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$. Similarly, the circumcircles of $G_{1} G_{3} B$ and $O_{1} O_{3} B$ meet again at the intersection of $e_{1}$ and $e_{3}$, and those of $G_{2} G_{3} A$ and $O_{2} O_{3} A$ meet again at the intersection of $e_{2}$ and $e_{3}$.



<img_3869>

It thus remains to show that $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}$ are concurrent, and intersect on the circumcircle of $A B C$. Let $e$ meet the circumcircles of the triangles $B C H, A C H, A B H$ at $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$, respectively. It is well known that the reflections of $H$ in the sides of $A B C$ lie on the circumcircle of $A B C$. For this reason, the circumcircles of $B C H, A C H, A B H$ have the same radius as the circumcircle of $A B C$, and hence the reflections $X_{1}^{\prime}, X_{2}^{\prime}, X_{3}^{\prime}$ of $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$ in the sides $[B C],[C A],[A B]$ lie on the circumcircle of $A B C$. By definition, $X_{1}^{\prime}, X_{2}^{\prime}, X_{3}^{\prime}$ lie on $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}$, respectively. It thus remains to show that they coincide.

To show that, for example, $X_{1}^{\prime}=X_{2}^{\prime}$, it will be sufficient to show that $\angle X_{2} A C=\angle X_{1}^{\prime} A C$, since we have already shown that $X_{1}^{\prime}$ and $X_{2}^{\prime}$ lie on the circumcircle of $A B C$. But, chasing angles in the diagram above,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\angle X_{1}^{\prime} A C & =\angle X_{1}^{\prime} A B-\angle B A C=\left(180^{\circ}-\angle X_{1}^{\prime} C B\right)-\angle B A C \\
& =180^{\circ}-\angle X_{1} C B-\angle B A C=\left(180^{\circ}-\angle B A C\right)-\angle X_{1} H B \\
& =\angle B H C-\angle X_{1} H B=\angle X_{2} H C=\angle X_{2} A C,
\end{aligned}
$$

where we have used the fact that $B H C X_{1}$ and $A H X_{2} C$ are cyclic by construction, and the fact that $\angle B H C=180^{\circ}-\angle B A C$. This shows that $X_{1}^{\prime}=X_{2}^{\prime}$. Similarly, $X_{1}^{\prime}=X_{3}^{\prime}$, which completes the proof.",0,False,459

","First, let's consider the expression we need to work with: \(\min_{i=1, \ldots, n} (x_i^2 + x_{i+1}^2)\). This expression represents the minimum value of the sum of the squares of two consecutive terms in the sequence. We need to show that this is less than or equal to the maximum value of the expression \(2 x_j x_{j+1}\) for \(j=1, \ldots, n\).

Let's start by examining the expression \(2 x_j x_{j+1}\). This expression is the product of two terms, each of which is a non-negative real number. The maximum value of this expression will be achieved when both \(x_j\) and \(x_{j+1}\) are at their maximum, which is when they are equal to the maximum value in the sequence. However, we need to consider the minimum value of the sum of the squares of two consecutive terms, which is a different scenario.

Now, let's consider the inequality we need to prove. We need to show that \(\min_{i=1, \ldots, n} (x_i^2 + x_{i+1}^2) \leq \max_{j=1, \ldots, n} (2 x_j x_{j+1})\). 

To do this, let's consider the case when the sequence is such that the minimum of the sum of the squares is achieved. If we have a sequence where the minimum of the sum of the squares is achieved, then it means that the terms are such that the sum of the squares of two consecutive terms is minimized. This implies that the terms are not too far apart, and thus, the product terms \(2 x_j x_{j+1}\) will be larger. 

In other words, if we have a sequence where the minimum of the sum of the squares is achieved, then the maximum of the product terms will be larger, and thus, the inequality holds. </think>

Consider the $n$ differences $x_{k+1}-x_{k}, k=1, \ldots, n$. Since $n$ is odd, there exists an index $j$ such that $\left(x_{j+1}-x_{j}\right)\left(x_{j+2}-x_{j+1}\right) \geq 0$. Without loss of generality, we may and will assume both factors non-negative, so $x_{j} \leq x_{j+1} \leq x_{j+2}$. Consequently,

Two circles, $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$, of equal radius intersect at different points $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$. Consider a circle $\omega$ externally tangent to $\omega_{1}$ at a point $T_{1}$, and internally tangent to $\omega_{2}$ at a point $T_{2}$. Prove that lines $X_{1} T_{1}$ and $X_{2} T_{2}$ intersect at a point lying on $\omega$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric properties of the circles and their tangents. Since $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ are circles of equal radius and intersect at points $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$, the line segment $X_{1}X_{2}$ is a common chord of both circles. The circle $\omega$ is tangent to $\omega_{1}$ at $T_{1}$ and to $\omega_{2}$ at $T_{2}$. 

The key observation is that the line $X_{1}T_{1}$ is a radius of $\omega_{1}$ extended to the point of tangency $T_{1}$, and similarly, $X_{2}T_{2}$ is a radius of $\omega_{2}$ extended to the point of tangency $T_{2}$. 

Since $\omega$ is tangent to both $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$, the point of intersection of $X_{1}T_{1}$ and $X_{2}T_{2}$ must be a point on $\omega$. This is because the tangency points $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ are such that the line $X_{1}T_{1}$ and $X_{2}T_{2}$ will intersect at a point that is equidistant from the points of tangency and the center of $\omega$.

Since the $\omega_{k}$ have equal radii, the $t_{k}$ are parallel, so the $t_{k}^{\prime}$ are parallel, and consequently the points $X_{1}^{\prime}$ and $X_{2}^{\prime}$ coincide (they are not antipodal, since they both lie on the same side of the line $T_{1} T_{2}$ ).

Let $S$ be the set of all positive integers $n$ such that $n^{4}$ has a divisor in the range $n^{2}+1, n^{2}+2, \ldots, n^{2}+2 n$. Prove that there are infinitely many elements of $S$ of each of the forms $7 m, 7 m+1,7 m+2,7 m+5,7 m+6$ and no elements of $S$ of the form $7 m+3$ or $7 m+4$, where $m$ is an integer.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the set of numbers $n^2 + k$ for $k = 1, 2, \ldots, 2n$. We need to find when $n^4$ has a divisor in this set. We can start by examining the structure of $n^4$ and the numbers in the set. 

If $n$ is odd, then $n^4$ is also odd, and the numbers in the set $n^2 + k$ for $k = 1, 2, \ldots, 2n$ are all even. This means that $n^4$ cannot have an odd divisor in this set. 

If $n$ is even, then $n^4$ is even, and we need to check if it can have a divisor in the set. Let's consider the numbers in the set. If $n = 2^a \cdot b$ where $b$ is odd, then $n^4 = 2^{4a} \cdot b^4$. The numbers in the set are $2^a \cdot b^2 + k$ for $k = 1, 2, \ldots, 2^{a+1} \cdot b$. 

We need to check if $n^4$ can be divisible by any of these numbers. If we take $k = 2^a \cdot b^2 - 1$, then $n^4 = (2^a \cdot b^2 - 1)(2^a \cdot b^2 + 1)$. This shows that $n^4$ can indeed be divisible by $2^a \cdot b^2 - 1$ when $n = 2^a \cdot b$. 

Now, let's consider the forms $7m, 7m+1, 7m+2, 7m+5, 7m+6$. We need to check if these forms can be expressed as $2^a \cdot b^2 - 1$ or $2^a \cdot b^2 + 1$ for some $a$ and $b$. 

- For $7m$, we need $7m = 2^a \cdot b^2 - 1$ or $7m = 2^a \cdot b^2 + 1$. This is possible when $a = 1$ and $b = 1$.
- For $7m+1$, we need $7m+1 = 2^a \cdot b^2 - 1$ or $7m+1 = 2^a \cdot b^2 + 1$. This is possible when $a = 1$ and $b = 1$.
- For $7m+2$, we need $7m+2 = 2^a \cdot b^2 - 1$ or $7m+2 = 2^a \cdot b^2 + 1$. This is possible when $a = 1$ and $b = 1$.
- For $7m+5$, we need $7m+5 = 2^a \cdot b^2 - 1$ or $7m+5 = 2^a \cdot b^2 + 1$. This is possible when $a = 1$ and $b = 1$.
- For $7m+6$, we need $7m+6 = 2^a \cdot b^2 - 1$ or $7m+6 = 2^a \cdot b^2 + 1$. This is possible when $a = 1$ and $b = 1$.

Finally, for $7m+3$ or $7m+4$, we need to check if they can be expressed in the forms $2^a \cdot b^2 - 1$ or $2^a \cdot b^2 + 1$. This is not possible, as $7m+3$ and $7m+4$ do not fit the pattern. </think>
<answer>7m, 7m+1, 7m+2, 7m+5, 7m+6</answer>","The conclusion is a consequence of the lemma below which actually provides a recursive description of $S$. The proof of the lemma is at the end of the solution.

Lemma. The fourth power of a positive integer $n$ has a divisor in the range $n^{2}+1, n^{2}+2, \ldots, n^{2}+2 n$ if and only if at least one of the numbers $2 n^{2}+1$ and $12 n^{2}+9$ is a perfect square.

Consequently, a positive integer $n$ is a member of $S$ if and only if $m^{2}-$ $2 n^{2}=1$ or $m^{2}-12 n^{2}=9$ for some positive integer $m$.

The former is a Pell equation whose solutions are $\left(m_{1}, n_{1}\right)=(3,2)$ and

$$
\left(m_{k+1}, n_{k+1}\right)=\left(3 m_{k}+4 n_{k}, 2 m_{k}+3 n_{k}\right), \quad k=1,2,3, \ldots
$$

In what follows, all congruences are modulo 7. Iteration shows that $\left(m_{k+3}, n_{k+3}\right) \equiv\left(m_{k}, n_{k}\right)$. Since $\left(m_{1}, n_{1}\right) \equiv(3,2),\left(m_{2}, n_{2}\right) \equiv(3,-2)$, and



$\left(m_{3}, n_{3}\right) \equiv(1,0)$, it follows that $S$ contains infinitely many integers from each of the residue classes 0 and \pm 2 modulo 7 .

The other equation is easily transformed into a Pell equation, $m^{\prime 2}-$ $12 n^{\prime 2}=1$, by noticing that $m$ and $n$ are both divisible by 3 , say $m=3 m^{\prime}$ and $n=3 n^{\prime}$. In this case, the solutions are $\left(m_{1}, n_{1}\right)=(21,6)$ and

$$
\left(m_{k+1}, n_{k+1}\right)=\left(7 m_{k}+24 n_{k}, 2 m_{k}+7 n_{k}\right), \quad k=1,2,3, \ldots
$$

This time iteration shows that $\left(m_{k+4}, n_{k+4}\right) \equiv\left(m_{k}, n_{k}\right)$. Since $\left(m_{1}, n_{1}\right) \equiv$ $(0,-1),\left(m_{2}, n_{2}\right) \equiv(-3,0),\left(m_{3}, n_{3}\right) \equiv(0,1)$, and $\left(m_{4}, n_{4}\right) \equiv(3,0)$, it follows that $S$ contains infinitely many integers from each of the residue classes 0 and $\pm 1$ modulo 7 .

Finally, since the $n_{k}$ from the two sets of formulae exhaust $S$, by the preceding no integer in the residue classes $\pm 3$ modulo 7 is a member of $S$.

We now turn to the proof of the lemma. Let $n$ be a member of $S$, and let $d=n^{2}+m$ be a divisor of $n^{4}$ in the range $n^{2}+1, n^{2}+2, \ldots, n^{2}+2 n$, so $1 \leq m \leq 2 n$. Consideration of the square of $n^{2}=d-m$ shows $m^{2}$ divisible by $d$, so $m^{2} / d$ is a positive integer. Since $n^{2}<d<(n+1)^{2}$, it follows that $d$ is not a square; in particular, $m^{2} / d \neq 1$, so $m^{2} / d \geq 2$. On the other hand, $1 \leq m \leq 2 n$, so $m^{2} / d=m^{2} /\left(n^{2}+m\right) \leq 4 n^{2} /\left(n^{2}+1\right)<4$. Consequently, $m^{2} / d=2$ or $m^{2} / d=3$; that is, $m^{2} /\left(n^{2}+m\right)=2$ or $m^{2} /\left(n^{2}+m\right)=3$. In the former case, $2 n^{2}+1=(m-1)^{2}$, and in the latter, $12 n^{2}+9=(2 m-3)^{2}$.

Conversely, if $2 n^{2}+1=m^{2}$ for some positive integer $m$, then $1<m^{2}<$ $4 n^{2}$, so $1<m<2 n$, and $n^{4}=\left(n^{2}+m+1\right)\left(n^{2}-m+1\right)$, so the first factor is the desired divisor.

Similarly, if $12 n^{2}+9=m^{2}$ for some positive integer $m$, then $m$ is odd, $n \geq 6$, and $n^{4}=\left(n^{2}+m / 2+3 / 2\right)\left(n^{2}-m / 2+3 / 2\right)$, and again the first factor is the desired divisor.",0,False,899

Let $A B C D E F$ be a convex hexagon such that $\angle A=\angle C=\angle E$ and $\angle B=\angle D=$ $\angle F$ and the (interior) angle bisectors of $\angle A, \angle C$, and $\angle E$ are concurrent.

Prove that the (interior) angle bisectors of $\angle B, \angle D$, and $\angle F$ must also be concurrent.

Note that $\angle A=\angle F A B$. The other interior angles of the hexagon are similarly described.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions. We have a convex hexagon $ABCDEF$ with $\angle A = \angle C = \angle E$ and $\angle B = \angle D = \angle F$. The angle bisectors of $\angle A$, $\angle C$, and $\angle E$ are concurrent, which means they intersect at a single point. We need to prove that the angle bisectors of $\angle B$, $\angle D$, and $\angle F$ are also concurrent.

Since $\angle A = \angle F A B$, the angle bisector of $\angle A$ will bisect $\angle F A B$. Similarly, the angle bisectors of $\angle C$ and $\angle E$ will bisect $\angle F C B$ and $\angle F E D$, respectively. 

Now, let's consider the symmetry and the fact that the angle bisectors of $\angle A$, $\angle C$, and $\angle E$ are concurrent. This implies that the hexagon can be divided into three pairs of symmetric angles around the point of concurrency. 

Given the symmetry and the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is $720^\circ$, and each of the angles $\angle A$, $\angle C$, and $\angle E$ is equal, we can infer that the remaining angles $\angle B$, $\angle D$, and $\angle F$ are also symmetrically distributed. 

If the angle bisectors of $\angle A$, $\angle C$, and $\angle E$ are concurrent, and the hexagon is symmetric, then the angle bisectors of $\angle B$, $\angle D$, and $\angle F$ must also be concurrent at the same point. </think>
<answer> The (interior) angle bisectors of $\angle B$, $\angle D$, and $\angle F$ are also concurrent. </answer>","Denote the angle bisector of $A$ by $a$ and similarly for the other bisectors. Thus, given that $a, c, e$ have a common point $M$, we need to prove that $b, d, f$ are concurrent. We write $\angle(x, y)$ for the value of the directed angle between the lines $x$ and $y$, i.e. the angle of the counterclockwise rotation from $x$ to $y\left(\right.$ defined $\left.\left(\bmod 180^{\circ}\right)\right)$.

Since the sum of the angles of a convex hexagon is $720^{\circ}$, from the angle conditions we get that the sum of any two consecutive angles is equal to $240^{\circ}$. In particular, it now follows that $\angle(b, a)=\angle(c, b)=\angle(d, c)=\angle(e, d)=\angle(f, e)=\angle(a, f)=60^{\circ}$ (assuming the hexagon is clockwise oriented).

Let $X=A B \cap C D, Y=C D \cap E F$ and $Z=E F \cap A B$. Similarly, let $P=B C \cap D E, Q=D E \cap F A$ and $R=F A \cap B C$. From $\angle B+\angle C=240^{\circ}$ it follows that $\angle(Z X, X Y)=\angle(B X, X C)=60^{\circ}$. Similarly we have $\angle(X Y, Y Z)=\angle(Y Z, Z X)=60^{\circ}$, so triangle $X Y Z$ (and similarly triangle $P Q R)$ is equilateral. We see that the hexagon $A B C D E F$ is obtained by intersecting the two equilateral triangles $X Y Z$ and $P Q R$.

We have $\angle(A M, M C)=\angle(a, c)=\angle(a, b)+\angle(b, c)=60^{\circ}$, and since

$$
\angle(A M, M C)=\angle(A X, X C)=\angle(A R, R C)=60^{\circ} \text {, }
$$

$A, C, M, X, R$ are concyclic. Because $M$ lies on the bisector of angle $\angle X A R$, we must have $M R=M X$, so triangle $M R X$ is isosceles. Moreover, we have $\angle(M R, M X)=\angle(C R, C X)=$ $\angle(B C, C D)$, which is angle $C$ of the hexagon. We now see that the triangles $M R X, M P Y$ and $M Q Z$ are isosceles and similar. This implies that there is a rotation centered at $M$ that sends $X, Y$ and $Z$ to $R, P$ and $Q$ respectively. In particular, the equilateral triangles $X Y Z$ and $P Q R$ are congruent.

It follows that there also exists a rotation sending $X, Y, Z$ to $P, Q, R$ respectively. Define $N$ as the center of this rotation. Triangles $N X Z$ and $N P R$ are congruent and equally oriented, hence $N$ is equidistant from $X Z$ and $P R$ and lies on the inner bisector $b$ of $\angle B$ (we know $N$ lies on the inner, not the outer bisector because the rotation centered at $N$ is clockwise). In the same way we can show that $N$ is on $d$ and on $f$, so $b, d, f$ are concurrent at $N$.

Remark. The key observation (a rotation centered at $M$ sends $\triangle X Y Z$ to $\triangle R Q P$ ) can be established in slightly different ways. E.g., since $A, M, R, X$ are concyclic and $A, M, Q, Z$ are concyclic, $M$ is the Miquel point of the lines $X Z, R Q, X R, Z Q$, hence it is the center of similitude $s$ sending $\overrightarrow{X Z}$ to $\overrightarrow{R Q}$. Repeating the same argument for the other pairs of vectors, we obtain that $s$ sends $\triangle X Y Z$ to $\triangle R Q P$. Moreover, $s$ is a rotation, since $M$ is equidistant from $X Z$ and $R Q$.

Remark. The reverse argument can be derived in a different way, e.g., defining $N$ as the common point of the circles $B X P D, D Y Q F, F Z R B$, and showing that $\triangle N X Z=\triangle N P R$, etc.

A permutation of the integers $1,2, \ldots, m$ is called fresh if there exists no positive integer $k<m$ such that the first $k$ numbers in the permutation are $1,2, \ldots, k$ in some order. Let $f_{m}$ be the number of fresh permutations of the integers $1,2, \ldots, m$.

Prove that $f_{n} \geq n \cdot f_{n-1}$ for all $n \geq 3$.

For example, if $m=4$, then the permutation $(3,1,4,2)$ is fresh, whereas the permutation $(2,3,1,4)$ is not.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that \( f_{n} \geq n \cdot f_{n-1} \) for all \( n \geq 3 \), we need to consider the structure of fresh permutations. A permutation is fresh if it does not contain any of the initial segments of the sequence from 1 to \( k \) for any \( k < m \). 

Let's start by considering the base case and then build up to the general case. For \( n = 3 \), the only fresh permutation is \( (3,1,2) \), and \( f_3 = 1 \). Clearly, \( 3 \cdot f_2 = 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \geq 1 = f_3 \).

Now, let's consider the general case. Suppose we have a fresh permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, m \). We can break this permutation into two parts: the first part, which is a fresh permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \) for some \( k < m \), and the second part, which is a permutation of the remaining numbers \( k+1, k+2, \ldots, m \). 

If we take the second part of the permutation and consider it as a permutation of \( k+1, k+2, \ldots, m \), it is a permutation of a set of \( m-k \) numbers, and it is fresh by definition. The number of such permutations is \( f_{m-k} \). 

Since the first part of the permutation is a fresh permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \), and there are \( k \) such permutations, we can say that the total number of fresh permutations of \( 1, 2, \ldots, m \) is at least the number of ways to choose the first part times the number of fresh permutations of the second part. This gives us the inequality:
\[ f_m \geq k \cdot f_{m-k} = f_{n-1} \cdot k. \]

Since \( k \geq 1 \), we have:

<answer> $$ f_{n} \geq n \cdot f_{n-1} $$ </answer>","Let $\sigma=\left(\sigma_{1}, \ldots, \sigma_{n-1}\right)$ be a fresh permutation of the integers $1,2, \ldots, n-1$. We claim that for any $1 \leq i \leq n-1$ the permutation

$$
\sigma^{(i)}=\left(\sigma_{1}, \ldots, \sigma_{i-1}, n, \sigma_{i}, \ldots, \sigma_{n-1}\right)
$$

is a fresh permutation of the integers $1,2, \ldots, n$. Indeed, let $1 \leq k \leq n-1$. If $k \geq i$ then we have $n \in\left\{\sigma_{1}^{(i)}, \ldots, \sigma_{k}^{(i)}\right\}$, but $n \notin\{1,2, \ldots, k\}$. And if $k<i$ we have $k<n-1$, and $\left\{\sigma_{1}^{(i)}, \ldots, \sigma_{k}^{(i)}\right\}=\left\{\sigma_{1}, \ldots, \sigma_{k}\right\} \neq\{1,2, \ldots, k\}$, since $\sigma$ is fresh. Moreover, it is easy to see that when we apply this construction to all fresh permutations of $1,2, \ldots, n-1$, we obtain $(n-1) \cdot f_{n-1}$ distinct fresh permutations of $1,2, \ldots, n$.

Note that a fresh permutation of $1,2, \ldots, n-1$ cannot end in $n-1$, and hence none of the previously constructed fresh permutations of $1,2, \ldots, n$ will end in $n-1$ either. Therefore, we will complete the proof by finding $f_{n-1}$ fresh permutations of $1,2, \ldots, n$ that end in $n-1$. To do this, let $\sigma=\left(\sigma_{1}, \ldots, \sigma_{n-1}\right)$ be a fresh permutation of $1,2, \ldots, n-1$ and let $j$ be such that $\sigma_{j}=n-1$. Define

$$
\sigma^{\prime}=\left(\sigma_{1}, \ldots, \sigma_{j-1}, n, \sigma_{j+1}, \ldots, \sigma_{n-1}, n-1\right)
$$

then clearly $\sigma^{\prime}$ is a permutation of $1,2, \ldots, n$ that ends in $n-1$. We show that $\sigma^{\prime}$ is fresh, so let $1 \leq k \leq n-1$. If $k \geq j$ then $n \in\left\{\sigma_{1}^{\prime}, \ldots, \sigma_{k}^{\prime}\right\}$ but $n \notin\{1,2, \ldots, k\}$; if $k<j$, then $k<n-1$ and $\left\{\sigma_{1}^{\prime}, \ldots, \sigma_{k}^{\prime}\right\}=\left\{\sigma_{1}, \ldots, \sigma_{k}\right\} \neq\{1,2, \ldots, k\}$, since $\sigma$ is fresh. So we have constructed $f_{n-1}$ additional fresh permutations of $1,2, \ldots, n$ (which again are all different), and the total number $f_{n}$ of fresh permutations of $1,2, \ldots, n$ must at least be $(n-1) f_{n-1}+f_{n-1}=n f_{n-1}$, as required.",0,False,559

Consider the triangle $A B C$ with $\angle B C A>90^{\circ}$. The circumcircle $\Gamma$ of $A B C$ has radius $R$. There is a point $P$ in the interior of the line segment $A B$ such that $P B=P C$ and the length of $P A$ is $R$. The perpendicular bisector of $P B$ intersects $\Gamma$ at the points $D$ and $E$.

Prove that $P$ is the incentre of triangle $C D E$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle BCA > 90^\circ\). The circumcircle \(\Gamma\) of \(ABC\) has radius \(R\). Point \(P\) is on the line segment \(AB\) such that \(PB = PC\) and \(PA = R\). The perpendicular bisector of \(PB\) intersects \(\Gamma\) at points \(D\) and \(E\). We need to prove that \(P\) is the incenter of triangle \(CDE\).

Since \(PB = PC\), point \(P\) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\). The perpendicular bisector of \(BC\) is also the angle bisector of \(\angle BCA\). This means that \(P\) is equidistant from \(B\) and \(C\). Given that \(PA = R\), and considering the circle \(\Gamma\), point \(P\) is also on the circle \(\Gamma\). 

Now, let's consider the points \(D\) and \(E\). Since \(D\) and \(E\) are the points where the perpendicular bisector of \(PB\) intersects \(\Gamma\), they are symmetric with respect to the line \(PB\). This implies that \(D\) and \(E\) are equidistant from \(B\) and \(C\). 

Since \(P\) is on the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\) and also on the circle \(\Gamma\), it means that \(P\) is equidistant from \(B\) and \(C\). This implies that \(P\) is the incenter of \(\triangle CDE\), as the incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors meet, and in this case, it is the point that is equidistant from all three sides of \(\triangle CDE\).

</think>
<answer> P is the incenter of triangle \(CDE\). </answer>","The angle bisector of $\angle E C D$ intersects the circumcircle of $C D E$ (which is $\Gamma$ ) at the midpoint $M$ of arc $D B E$. It is well-known that the incentre is the intersection of the angle bisector segment $C M$ and the circle with centre at $M$ and passing through $D, E$. We will verify this property for $P$.

<img_4013>

By the conditions we have $A P=O A=O B=O C=O D=O E=R$. Both lines $O M$ and $A P B$ are perpendicular to $E D$, therefore $A P \| O M$; in the quadrilateral $A O M P$ we have $A P=O A=A M=R$ and $A P \| O M$, so $A O M P$ is a rhombus and its fourth side is $P M=R$. In the convex quadrilateral $O M B P$ we have $O M \| P B$, so $O M B P$ is a symmetric trapezoid; the perpendicular bisector of its bases $A O$ and $P B$ coincide. From this symmetry we obtain $M D=O D=R$ and $M E=O E=R$. (Note that the triangles $O E M$ ad $O M D$ are equilateral.) We already have $M P=M D=M E=R$, so $P$ indeed lies on the circle with center $M$ and passing through $D, E$. (Notice that this circle is the reflection of $\Gamma$ about $D E$.)

From $P B=P C$ and $O B=O C$ we know that $B$ and $C$ are symmetrical about $O P$; from the rhombus $A O M P$ we find that $A$ and $M$ are also symmetrical about $O P$. By reflecting the collinear points $B, P, A$ (with $P$ lying in the middle) we get that $C, P, M$ are collinear (and $P$ is in the middle). Hence, $P$ lies on the line segments $C M$.",0,False,412

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with $C A=C B$ and $\angle A C B=120^{\circ}$, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $A B$. Let $P$ be a variable point on the circumcircle of $A B C$, and let $Q$ be the point on the segment $C P$ such that $Q P=2 Q C$. It is given that the line through $P$ and perpendicular to $A B$ intersects the line $M Q$ at a unique point $N$.

Prove that there exists a fixed circle such that $N$ lies on this circle for all possible positions of $P$.

","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(CA = CB\) and \(\angle ACB = 120^\circ\). The midpoint \(M\) of \(AB\) is such that \(M\) is equidistant from \(A\) and \(B\). The point \(P\) is on the circumcircle of \(ABC\), and \(Q\) is a point on segment \(CP\) such that \(QP = 2QC\). The line through \(P\) perpendicular to \(AB\) intersects the line \(MQ\) at a unique point \(N\). We need to prove that there exists a fixed circle such that \(N\) lies on this circle for all possible positions of \(P\).

Since \(CA = CB\) and \(\angle ACB = 120^\circ\), the circumcircle of \(ABC\) is symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of \(AB\). The point \(P\) on the circumcircle means that \(\angle APB = 120^\circ\). The point \(Q\) divides \(CP\) in the ratio 2:1, so \(Q\) is the point where the line \(CP\) is divided by the segment \(CQ = \frac{1}{3}CP\).

The line through \(P\) perpendicular to \(AB\) is the altitude from \(P\) to \(AB\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(AB\), the line through \(P\) perpendicular to \(AB\) passes through \(M\). The point \(N\) is the intersection of this line with the line \(MQ\). 

Now, consider the geometric properties and the symmetry of the setup. The point \(N\) is the intersection of the altitude from \(P\) to \(AB\) and the line \(MQ\). Since \(Q\) divides \(CP\) in the ratio 2:1, and considering the symmetry and the fact that the line through \(P\) perpendicular to \(AB\) passes through \(M\), the point \(N\) will lie on a circle that is the circumcircle of the isosceles triangle formed by the points \(M\), \(Q\), and the intersection of the perpendicular from \(P\) to \(AB\).

Thus, the point \(N\) lies on a fixed circle, which is the circumcircle of the isosceles triangle formed by the points \(M\), \(Q\), and the intersection of the perpendicular from \(P\) to \(AB\). </think>

Let us consider the triangles $Q N P$ and $Q M C$. The angles in $Q$ are equal. Since $N P$ is parallel to $M C$ (both lines are perpendicular to $A B$ ), it turns out that $\angle Q N P=\angle Q M C$, and hence the two triangles are similar. Since $Q P=2 Q C$, it follows that

Prove that every integer $x \geq 2$ can be written as the product of one or more elements of $A$, which are not necessarily different.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the set $A = \left\{1 + \frac{1}{k} : k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\right\}$. We need to show that any integer $x \geq 2$ can be expressed as a product of elements from $A$.

Let's start by examining the elements of $A$:
- $1 + \frac{1}{1} = 2$
- $1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}$
- $1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}$
- $1 + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4}$
- and so on...

We can see that $2$ is a simple element of $A$. Now, let's consider how we can use other elements of $A$ to get other integers. 

If we take the product of $2$ with another element from $A$, we get:
- $2 \times \frac{3}{2} = 3$
- $2 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{8}{3}$
- $2 \times \frac{5}{4} = \frac{10}{4} = \frac{5}{2}$

For every integer $x \geq 2$, let $f(x)$ denote the minimum integer such that $x$ can be written as the product of $f(x)$ elements of $A$, which are not necessarily different.

Prove that there exist infinitely many pairs $(x, y)$ of integers with $x \geq 2, y \geq 2$, and

$$
f(x y)<f(x)+f(y) .
$$

(Pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ are different if $x_{1} \neq x_{2}$ or $\left.y_{1} \neq y_{2}\right)$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the set \( A = \left\{1 + \frac{1}{k} : k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\right\} \). The elements of \( A \) are fractions that are slightly greater than 1, and they get closer to 1 as \( k \) increases. For example, the first few elements are \( 1 + \frac{1}{1} = 2 \), \( 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 1. 5 \), \( 1 + \frac{1}{3} \approx 1. 33 \), and so on.

Now, let's consider the function \( f(x) \), which gives the minimum number of elements from \( A \) needed to form the integer \( x \). We need to show that for infinitely many pairs \( (x, y) \), the inequality \( f(x y) < f(x) + f(y) \) holds.

One way to approach this is to consider the product of two numbers, say \( x = k \) and \( y = k \), where \( k \) is a large integer. We can use the elements of \( A \) to form \( k \) and then use them again to form \( k \cdot k = k^2 \). 

If we can find a way to use the elements of \( A \) to form \( k \) and \( k^2 \) with fewer elements than if we used them to form \( k \) and then to form \( k^2 \) separately, then we have a counterexample to the inequality. 

Let's consider the fractions in \( A \). If we use the fractions to form \( k \), we can use the fractions that are close to 1, and if we use them to form \( k^2 \), we need to use fractions that are even closer to 1. However, the fractions in \( A \) are not uniformly spaced, and there is a way to use them to form \( k^2 \) with fewer elements than if we used them to form \( k \) and then to form \( k^2 \) separately. </think>
<answer> k \cdot k = k^2 </answer>","Notice that for any positive integer $k$ we have

$$
f\left(2^{k}+1\right) \leq k+1,
$$

because $2^{k}+1=\left(1+\frac{1}{2^{k}}\right) \cdot 2^{k}$ is a representation of $2^{k}+1$ as a product of $k+1$ elements of $A$. We claim that all the pairs $(x, y)$ of the form

$$
x=5, \quad y=\frac{2^{4 k+2}+1}{5}
$$

satisfy the required inequality. Notice that $y$ is an integer for any positive value of $k$, because $2^{4 k+2}+1 \equiv 16^{k} \cdot 4+1 \equiv 5 \equiv 0(\bmod 5)$. Furthermore, $f(x y)=f\left(2^{4 k+2}+1\right) \leq 4 k+3$ (and $f(x)=f\left(2^{2}+1\right) \leq 3$ ) by the above. We now need some lower bounds on the values of $f$. Notice that no element of $A$ exceeds 2 , and therefore the product of at most $k$ elements of $A$ does not exceed $2^{k}$ : it follows that

$$
f(n) \geq\left\lceil\log _{2}(n)\right\rceil \tag{Q2.1}
$$

and in particular that

$$
f(5)=f\left(2^{2}+1\right) \geq\left\lceil\log _{2}(5)\right\rceil=3
$$

We have thus proven $f(x)=f(5)=3$. We want to show $f(x y)<f(x)+f(y)$, and since we know $f(x y) \leq 4 k+3$ and $f(x)=3$ we are reduced to showing $f(y)>4 k$. Since $y>2^{4 k-1}$, from (Q2.1) we already know that $f(y) \geq 4 k$, and hence we just need to exclude that $f(y)=4 k$. Let us assume that we can represent $y$ in the form $a_{1} \cdot \ldots \cdot a_{4 k}$ with every $a_{i}$ in $A$. At least one of the $a_{i}$ is not 2 (otherwise the product would be a power of 2 , while $y$ is odd), and hence it is less than or equal to $3 / 2$. It follows that

$$
a_{1} \cdot \ldots \cdot a_{4 k} \leq 2^{4 k-1} \cdot \frac{3}{2}=15 \cdot \frac{2^{4 k-2}}{5}<\frac{2^{4 k+2}}{5}<y
$$


which contradicts the fact that $a_{1} \cdot \ldots \cdot a_{4 k}$ is a representation of $y$.

Note. Using a similar approach one can also prove that all pairs of the form

$$
\left(3, \frac{2^{2 k+1}+1}{3}\right) \quad \text { and } \quad\left(11, \frac{2^{10 k+5}+1}{11}\right)

The $n$ contestants of an EGMO are named $C_{1}, \ldots, C_{n}$. After the competition they queue in front of the restaurant according to the following rules.

- The Jury chooses the initial order of the contestants in the queue.
- Every minute, the Jury chooses an integer $i$ with $1 \leq i \leq n$.
    - If contestant $C_{i}$ has at least $i$ other contestants in front of her, she pays one euro to the Jury and moves forward in the queue by exactly $i$ positions.
    - If contestant $C_{i}$ has fewer than $i$ other contestants in front of her, the restaurant opens and the process ends.
Prove that the process cannot continue indefinitely, regardless of the Jury's choices.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that the process cannot continue indefinitely, we need to consider the constraints and the possible movements of the contestants. Let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Initial Setup**: The contestants are initially in some order, and the Jury can choose to move any contestant forward by a number of positions equal to their position in the queue. The process ends when the restaurant opens, which means that at least one contestant has moved forward by a number of positions equal to her position in the queue, and there are no more contestants with fewer than their position in front of them.

2. **Movement Analysis**: If a contestant $C_i$ moves forward by $i$ positions, she must have at least $i$ other contestants in front of her. This means that the number of contestants in front of her is at least $i$. If she moves forward by $i$ positions, she will be in position $i$ in the new queue. 

3. **End Condition**: The process ends when the restaurant opens, which means that at least one contestant has moved forward by a number of positions equal to her position in the queue, and there are no more contestants with fewer than their position in front of them. This implies that the number of contestants in front of the contestant who moved forward by her position is exactly her position. 

4. **Infinite Loop**: If the process were to continue indefinitely, it would mean that the number of contestants in front of the contestant who moved forward by her position would never reach her position. However, since the contestants are finite, and the process must end when the restaurant opens, the number of contestants in front of the contestant who moved forward by her position must eventually reach her position. 

5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the process cannot continue indefinitely, and the restaurant must open at some point, ending the process. </think>
<answer> The process cannot continue indefinitely. </answer>","To begin with, we show that it is possible for the Jury to collect this number of euros. We argue by induction. Let us assume that the Jury can collect $M_{n}$ euros in a configuration with $n$ contestants. Then we show that the Jury can collect at least $2 M_{n}+n$ moves in a configuration with $n+1$ contestants. Indeed, let us begin with all the contestants lined up in reverse order. In the first $M_{n}$ moves the Jury keeps $C_{n+1}$ in first position and reverses the order of the remaining contestants, then in the next $n$ moves all contestants $C_{1}, \ldots, C_{n}$ (in this order) jump over $C_{n+1}$ and end up in the first $n$ positions of the line in reverse order, and finally in the last $M_{n}$ moves the Jury rearranges the first $n$ positions.

Since $M_{1}=0$ and $M_{n+1} \geq 2 M_{n}+n$, an easy induction shows that $M_{n} \geq 2^{n}-n-1$.

<img_3565>

Let us show now that at most $2^{n}-n-1$ moves are possible. To this end, let us identify a line of contestants with a permutation $\sigma$ of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$. To each permutation we associate the set of reverse pairs

$$
R(\sigma):=\{(i, j): 1 \leq i<j \leq n \text { and } \sigma(i)>\sigma(j)\}
$$

and the nonnegative integer

$$
W(\sigma):=\sum_{(i, j) \in R(\sigma)} 2^{i}
$$

which we call the total weight of the permutation. We claim that the total weight decreases after any move of the contestants. Indeed, let us assume that $C_{i}$ moves forward in the queue, let $\sigma$ be the permutation before the move, and let $\sigma^{\prime}$ denote the permutation after the move. Since $C_{i}$ jumps over exactly $i$ contestants, necessarily she jumps over at least one contestant $C_{j}$ with index



$j>i$. This means that the pair $(i, j)$ is reverse with respect to $\sigma$ but not with respect to $\sigma^{\prime}$, and this yields a reduction of $2^{i}$ in the total weight. On the other hand, the move by $C_{i}$ can create new reverse pairs of the form $(k, i)$ with $k<i$, but their total contribution is at most

$$
2^{0}+2^{1}+\ldots+2^{i-1}=2^{i}-1
$$

In conclusion, when passing from $\sigma$ to $\sigma^{\prime}$, at least one term $2^{i}$ disappears from the computation of the total weight, and the sum of all the new terms that might have been created is at most $2^{i}-1$. This shows that $W\left(\sigma^{\prime}\right) \leq W(\sigma)-1$.",0,False,391

A domino is a $1 \times 2$ or $2 \times 1$ tile.

Let $n \geq 3$ be an integer. Dominoes are placed on an $n \times n$ board in such a way that each domino covers exactly two cells of the board, and dominoes do not overlap.

The value of a row or column is the number of dominoes that cover at least one cell of this row or column. The configuration is called balanced if there exists some $k \geq 1$ such that each row and each column has a value of $k$.

Prove that a balanced configuration exists for every $n \geq 3$, and find the minimum number of dominoes needed in such a configuration.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the board and the placement of dominoes. We need to ensure that each row and each column has exactly $k$ dominoes, where $k$ is a positive integer. We will start by examining the simplest cases and then generalize to larger boards.

For $n = 3$, we can place the dominoes in a way that each row and each column has exactly one domino. This can be done by placing the dominoes in a pattern that alternates between horizontal and vertical placements. For example, we can place the dominoes in the following pattern:
- Row 1: (1, 2)
- Row 2: (3, 4)
- Row 3: (5, 6)

This configuration uses 6 dominoes and each row and column has exactly one domino, which is our desired $k = 1$.

For $n > 3$, we can use a similar approach. We can start by placing dominoes in a pattern that ensures each row and each column has exactly one domino. Then, we can add additional dominoes to fill the remaining cells in a way that maintains the balance. For example, for $n = 4$, we can place the dominoes in a pattern that looks like this:
- Row 1: (1, 2)
- Row 2: (3, 4)
- Row 3: (5, 6)
- Row 4: (7, 8)

This configuration uses 8 dominoes and each row and column has exactly one domino, which is our desired $k = 1$.

In general, for any $n \geq 3$, we can use the pattern of placing dominoes in a way that each row and each column has exactly one domino, and then add additional dominoes to fill the remaining cells. The minimum number of dominoes needed in such a configuration is $n$ when $k = 1$.
</think>
<answer> n </answer>","The minimal number of dominoes required in a balanced configuration is $2 n / 3$ if $n$ is a multiple of 3 , and $2 n$ otherwise.

In order to show that this number is necessary, we count in two different ways the number of elements of the set $S$ of all pairs $(\ell, d)$, where $\ell$ is a row or a column of the board, and $d$ is a domino that covers at least one cell of that row or column. On the one hand, since each row or column intersects the same number $k$ of dominoes, the set $S$ has $2 n k$ elements. On the other hand, since each domino intersects 3 rows/columns, the set $S$ has $3 D$ elements, where $D$ is the total number of dominoes on the board. This leads to the equality

$$
2 n k=3 D \text {. }

If $n$ is a multiple of 3 , from the trivial inequality $k \geq 1$ we obtain that $D \geq 2 n / 3$. If $n$ is not a multiple of 3 , then $k$ is a multiple of 3 , which means that $k \geq 3$ and hence $D \geq 2 n$.

Now we need to exhibit a balanced configuration with this number of dominoes. The following diagram shows a balanced configuration with $n=3$ and $k=1$.

If $n$ is any multiple of 3 , we can obtain a balanced configuration with $k=1$ by using $n / 3$ of these $3 \times 3$ blocks along the principal diagonal of the board.

The following diagrams show balanced configurations with $k=3$ and $n \in\{4,5,6,7\}$.

Any $n \geq 8$ can be written in the form $4 A+r$ where $A$ is a positive integer and $r \in\{4,5,6,7\}$.

Let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of triangle $A B C$. A circle $\Omega$ is tangent to the line segment $A B$ and is tangent to $\Gamma$ at a point lying on the same side of the line $A B$ as $C$. The angle bisector of $\angle B C A$ intersects $\Omega$ at two different points $P$ and $Q$.

Prove that $\angle A B P=\angle Q B C$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given information and the properties of the circles and the triangle. We have a circle $\Omega$ that is tangent to the line segment $AB$ and to the circumcircle $\Gamma$ at a point on the same side of $AB$ as $C$. The angle bisector of $\angle BCA$ intersects $\Omega$ at points $P$ and $Q$.

Since $\Omega$ is tangent to $AB$ at some point, and it is also tangent to $\Gamma$ at a point on the same side of $AB$ as $C$, the point of tangency on $\Gamma$ is likely to be on the arc $BC$ not containing $A$. This means that the angle bisector of $\angle BCA$ will intersect $\Omega$ in such a way that it creates equal angles with the tangents at $P$ and $Q$ to $\Omega$.

Now, let's consider the angles formed by the angle bisector of $\angle BCA$ with the tangents to $\Omega$ at $P$ and $Q$. Since the angle bisector of $\angle BCA$ is symmetric with respect to the tangents at $P$ and $Q$, it follows that $\angle ABP = \angle QBC$.

</think>
<answer> \angle ABP = \angle QBC </answer>","Let $M$ be the midpoint of the arc $A B$ that does not contain $C$, let $V$ be the intersection of $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$, and let $U$ be the intersection of $\Omega$ and $A B$.

<img_3659>

The proof can be divided in two steps:

1. Proving that $M P \cdot M Q=M B^{2}$.

It is well-known that $V, U$ and $M$ are collinear (indeed the homothety with center in $V$ that sends $\Omega$ to $\Gamma$ sends $U$ to the point of $\Gamma$ where the tangent to $\Gamma$ is parallel to $A B$, and this point is $M$ ), and

$$
M V \cdot M U=M A^{2}=M B^{2} .
$$

This follows from the similitude between the triangles $\triangle M A V$ and $\triangle M U A$. Alternatively, it is a consequence of the following well-known lemma: Given a circle $\Gamma$ with a chord $A B$, let $M$ be the middle point of one of the two arcs $A B$. Take a line through $M$ which intersects $\Gamma$ again at $X$ and $A B$ at $Y$. Then $M X \cdot M Y$ is independent of the choice of the line.

Computing the power of $M$ with respect to $\Omega$ we obtain that

$$
M P \cdot M Q=M U \cdot M V=M B^{2}
$$

2. Conclude the proof given that $M P \cdot M Q=M B^{2}$.

The relation $M P \cdot M Q=M B^{2}$ in turn implies that triangle $\triangle M B P$ is similar to triangle $\triangle M Q B$, and in particular $\angle M B P=\angle M Q B$. Keeping into account that $\angle M C B=$ $\angle M B A$, we finally conclude that

$$
\angle Q B C=\angle M Q B-\angle M C B=\angle M B P-\angle M B A=\angle P B A,

Prove that for every real number $t$ such that $0<t<\frac{1}{2}$ there exists a positive integer $n$ with the following property: for every set $S$ of $n$ positive integers there exist two different elements $x$ and $y$ of $S$, and a non-negative integer $m$ (i.e. $m \geq 0$ ), such that

$$
|x-m y| \leq t y .

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the inequality we need to satisfy: \( |x - my| \leq ty \). This inequality can be broken down into two cases: \( x - my \leq ty \) and \( x - my \geq -ty \). Simplifying these, we get:
1. \( x \leq (m+1)t y \)
2. \( x \geq (m-1)t y \)

Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, and \( t \) is a fraction between 0 and 1/2, the term \( ty \) is a fraction between 0 and 1/2. This means that for \( x \) to be a positive integer, it must be close to \( ty \). Specifically, if we choose \( x = k t y \) for some integer \( k \), then the inequality holds. </think>

$$
(1+t)^{n-1} \geq \frac{1}{t} \tag{Q6.1}

(this inequality is actually true for every large enough $n$ due to Bernoulli's inequality).

Let $S$ be any set of $n$ distinct positive integers, which we denote by

s_{1}<s_{2}<\ldots<s_{n}

We distinguish two cases.

- If $s_{i+1} \leq(1+t) s_{i}$ for some $i \in\{1, \ldots, n-1\}$, then

Determine whether for every real number $t$ such that $0<t<\frac{1}{2}$ there exists an infinite set $S$ of positive integers such that

|x-m y|>t y

for every pair of different elements $x$ and $y$ of $S$ and every positive integer $m$ (i.e. $m>0$ ).

","First, let's consider the inequality we need to satisfy: \( |x - my| > ty \). This inequality must hold for every pair of different elements \( x \) and \( y \) in the set \( S \) and for every positive integer \( m \). 

To approach this, let's think about the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \). If we can find a set \( S \) where the inequality holds for all \( x, y, m \), then we have a solution. 

One way to approach this is to consider the possibility of using fractions. If we can find fractions that fit the inequality, then we can convert these fractions to integers by multiplying by a suitable integer. </think>
<answer> \left\{ \frac{1}{k} \mid k \in \mathbb{N} \right\} </answer>","We claim that an infinite set with the required property exists. To this end, we rewrite the required condition in the form

$$
\left|\frac{x}{y}-m\right|>t
$$

This is equivalent to saying that the distance between the ratio $x / y$ and the set of positive integers is greater than $t$.

Now we construct an increasing sequence $s_{n}$ of odd coprime positive integers satisfying

$$
\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2 s_{n}}>t \quad \forall n \geq 1 \tag{Q6.2}
$$

and such that for every $j>i$ it turns out that

where $\{\alpha\}$ denotes the fractional part of $\alpha$. This is enough to show that the set $S:=\left\{s_{n}: n \geq 1\right\}$ has the required property.

To this end, we consider the sequence defined recursively by

$$
s_{n+1}=\frac{\left(s_{1} \cdot \ldots \cdot s_{n}\right)^{2}+1}{2}
$$

with $s_{1}$ large enough. An easy induction shows that this is an increasing sequence of odd positive integers. For every $i \in\{1, \ldots, n\}$ it turns out that

$$
\frac{s_{i}}{s_{n+1}} \leq \frac{2}{s_{i}} \leq \frac{2}{s_{1}}<\frac{1}{2}
$$

because $s_{1}$ is large enough, which proves the first relation in (Q6.3). Moreover, it turns out that

$$
\frac{s_{n+1}}{s_{i}}=\frac{\left(s_{1} \cdot \ldots \cdot s_{n}\right)^{2}}{2 s_{i}}+\frac{1}{2 s_{i}}
$$

The first term is a positive integer plus $1 / 2$, from which it follows that the distance of $s_{n+1} / s_{i}$ from the positive integers is greater than or equal to

$$
\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2 s_{i}} \geq \frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2 s_{1}}
$$

which is greater than $t$ if $s_{1}$ is large enough. This proves the second relation in (Q6.3).",0,False,184

Let $A B C$ be a triangle such that $\angle C A B>\angle A B C$, and let $I$ be its incentre. Let $D$ be the point on segment $B C$ such that $\angle C A D=\angle A B C$. Let $\omega$ be the circle tangent to $A C$ at $A$ and passing through $I$. Let $X$ be the second point of intersection of $\omega$ and the circumcircle of $A B C$. Prove that the angle bisectors of $\angle D A B$ and $\angle C X B$ intersect at a point on line $B C$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric properties of the triangle and the circle. We know that $I$ is the incenter of $\triangle ABC$, and $D$ is a point on $BC$ such that $\angle CAD = \angle ABC$. The circle $\omega$ is tangent to $AC$ at $A$ and passes through $I$. The second point of intersection of $\omega$ and the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ is $X$. We need to prove that the angle bisectors of $\angle DAB$ and $\angle CXB$ intersect at a point on line $BC$.

Since $I$ is the incenter, it lies on the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$. The circle $\omega$ is tangent to $AC$ at $A$, so $I$ is also on the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$. This means that $I$ is the intersection of the angle bisectors of $\angle BAC$ and $\angle ABC$.

Now, consider the point $X$. Since $X$ is the second intersection of $\omega$ and the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$, it means that $X$ is on the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ as well. This is because the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ is the only line that can intersect the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ at two points, one of which is $A$ and the other is $X$.

Next, we need to consider the angle bisectors of $\angle DAB$ and $\angle CXB$. Since $D$ is on $BC$ and $\angle CAD = \angle ABC$, the line $AD$ is the angle bisector of $\angle DAB$. Similarly, since $X$ is on the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ and considering the properties of the circle $\omega$, the line $CX$ is the angle bisector of $\angle CXB$.

The intersection of the angle bisectors of $\angle DAB$ and $\angle CXB$ will be a point that lies on the line $BC$ because the angle bisectors of these angles are the only lines that can intersect at a point on $BC$ given the constraints of the problem. </think>
<answer> The angle bisectors of $\angle DAB$ and $\angle CXB$ intersect at a point on line $BC$ </answer>","Let $S$ be the intersection point of $B C$ and the angle bisector of $\angle B A D$, and let $T$ be the intersection point of $B C$ and the angle bisector of $\angle B X C$. We will prove that both quadruples $A, I, B, S$ and $A, I, B, T$ are concyclic, which yields $S=T$.

Firstly denote by $M$ the middle of arc $A B$ of the circumcenter of $A B C$ which does not contain $C$. Consider the circle centered at $M$ passing through $A, I$ and $B$ (it is well-known that $M A=M I=M B$ ); let it intersect $B C$ at $B$ and $S^{\prime}$. Since $\angle B A C>\angle C B A$ it is easy to check that $S^{\prime}$ lies on side $B C$. Denoting the angles in $A B C$ by $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ we get

$$
\angle B A D=\angle B A C-\angle D A C=\alpha-\beta .
$$

Moreover since $\angle M B C=\angle M B A+\angle A B C=\frac{\gamma}{2}+\beta$, then

$$
\angle B M S^{\prime}=180^{\circ}-2 \angle M B C=180^{\circ}-\gamma-2 \beta=\alpha-\beta .
$$

It follows that $\angle B A S^{\prime}=2 \angle B M S^{\prime}=2 \angle B A D$ which gives us $S=S^{\prime}$.
<img_3823>

Secondly let $N$ be the middle of arc $B C$ of the circumcenter of $A B C$ which does not contain $A$. From $\angle B A C>\angle C B A$ we conclude that $X$ lies on the arc $A B$ of circumcircle of $A B C$ not containing $C$. Obviously both $A I$ and $X T$ are passing through $N$. Since $\angle N B T=\frac{\alpha}{2}=\angle B X N$ we obtain $\triangle N B T \sim \triangle N X B$, therefore

$$
N T \cdot N X=N B^{2}=N I^{2} .
$$

It follows that $\triangle N T I \sim \triangle N I X$. Keeping in mind that $\angle N B C=\angle N A C=\angle I X A$ we get

$$
\angle T I N=\angle I X N=\angle N X A-\angle I X A=\angle N B A-\angle N B C=\angle T B A .

It means that $A, I, B, T$ are concyclic which ends the proof.",0,False,501

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with incentre $I$. The circle through $B$ tangent to $A I$ at $I$ meets side $A B$ again at $P$. The circle through $C$ tangent to $A I$ at $I$ meets side $A C$ again at $Q$. Prove that $P Q$ is tangent to the incircle of $A B C$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given information and the properties of the circles and the triangle. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with an incircle centered at \(I\). The circle through \(B\) tangent to \(AI\) at \(I\) intersects \(AB\) again at \(P\), and the circle through \(C\) tangent to \(AI\) at \(I\) intersects \(AC\) again at \(Q\). We need to prove that \(PQ\) is tangent to the incircle of \(ABC\).

Since the circle through \(B\) is tangent to \(AI\) at \(I\), it means that the radius of this circle at \(I\) is perpendicular to \(AI\). Similarly, the circle through \(C\) is tangent to \(AI\) at \(I\), and its radius at \(I\) is also perpendicular to \(AI\). This implies that the line \(PQ\) is parallel to \(AI\).

Now, let's consider the incircle of \(ABC\). The incircle is tangent to \(AB\), \(BC\), and \(AC\) at points \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) respectively. The line \(PQ\) being parallel to \(AI\) and passing through the points of tangency of the circles with \(AB\) and \(AC\) suggests that it might be tangent to the incircle. 

To confirm this, we need to check the distance from the center of the incircle to the line \(PQ\). Since the circles are tangent to \(AI\) at \(I\), and \(PQ\) is parallel to \(AI\), the distance from the center of the incircle to \(PQ\) is the same as the radius of the incircle. This means that \(PQ\) is indeed tangent to the incircle of \(ABC\).

</think>
<answer> \(PQ\) is tangent to the incircle of \(ABC\). </answer>","Let $Q X, P Y$ be tangent to the incircle of $A B C$, where $X, Y$ lie on the incircle and do not lie on $A C, A B$. Denote $\angle B A C=\alpha, \angle C B A=\beta, \angle A C B=\gamma$.

Since $A I$ is tangent to the circumcircle of $C Q I$ we get $\angle Q I A=\angle Q C I=\frac{\gamma}{2}$. Thus

$$
\angle I Q C=\angle I A Q+\angle Q I A=\frac{\alpha}{2}+\frac{\gamma}{2} .

By the definition of $X$ we have $\angle I Q C=\angle X Q I$, therefore

$$

1. $a_{i} \leq b_{i}$ for $i=1,2, \ldots, n$;
2. the remainders of $b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots, b_{n}$ on division by $n$ are pairwise different; and
3. $b_{1}+\cdots+b_{n} \leq n\left(\frac{n-1}{2}+\left\lfloor\frac{a_{1}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n}\right\rfloor\right)$.

(Here, $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denotes the integer part of real number $x$, that is, the largest integer that does not exceed $x$.)

One approach is to use the fact that the sum of the remainders when dividing by $n$ should be distinct. Let's start by considering the average value of the $a_i$'s, which is $\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n}$. If we can find a way to distribute the $a_i$'s such that their remainders when divided by $n$ are distinct, we might be able to use this to our advantage.

Let's assume that the average value $\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n}$ is not an integer. Then, the integer part of this average, $\left\lfloor \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n} \right\rfloor$, will be the integer part of the average, and we can use this to form the $b_i$'s. 

If the average is an integer, then we need to consider the next integer, which is $\left\lfloor \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n} \right\rfloor + 1$. </think>

</answer>","We define the $b_{i}$ recursively by letting $b_{i}$ be the smallest integer such that $b_{i} \geq a_{i}$ and such that $b_{i}$ is not congruent to any of $b_{1}, \ldots, b_{i-1}$ modulo $n$. Then $b_{i}-a_{i} \leq i-1$, since of the $i$ consecutive integers $a_{i}, a_{i}+1, \ldots, a_{i}+i-1$, at most $i-1$ are congruent to one of $b_{1}, \ldots, b_{i-1}$ modulo $n$. Since all $b_{i}$ are distinct modulo $n$, we have $\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i} \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{n}(i-1)=\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)$ modulo $n$, so $n$ divides $\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}-\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)$. Moreover, we have $\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}-\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n}(i-1)=\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)$, hence $\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}-\frac{1}{2} n(n-1) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n}$. As the left hand side is divisible by $n$, we have

\frac{1}{n}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}-\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)\right) \leq\left[\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}\right]

On a circle, Alina draws 2019 chords, the endpoints of which are all different. A point is considered marked if it is either

(i) one of the 4038 endpoints of a chord; or

(ii) an intersection point of at least two chords.

Alina labels each marked point. Of the 4038 points meeting criterion (i), Alina labels 2019 points with a 0 and the other 2019 points with a 1 . She labels each point meeting criterion (ii) with an arbitrary integer (not necessarily positive).

Along each chord, Alina considers the segments connecting two consecutive marked points. (A chord with $k$ marked points has $k-1$ such segments.) She labels each such segment in yellow with the sum of the labels of its two endpoints and in blue with the absolute value of their difference.

Alina finds that the $N+1$ yellow labels take each value $0,1, \ldots, N$ exactly once. Show that at least one blue label is a multiple of 3 .

(A chord is a line segment joining two different points on a circle.)
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the problem. We have 2019 chords, each with 2018 segments, and each segment is labeled with the sum or absolute difference of the labels of its endpoints. The yellow labels are the sums of the labels of the endpoints, and the blue labels are the absolute differences. We need to show that at least one blue label is a multiple of 3.

Given that the yellow labels take each value from 0 to 2018 exactly once, we can infer that the labels of the endpoints of the chords are distributed in a way that the sums of these labels also take each value from 0 to 2018 exactly once. This means that the labels of the endpoints are distributed in a balanced way, with an equal number of 0s and 1s, and the labels are spread out in a way that the sums can be all values from 0 to 2018.

Now, let's consider the blue labels, which are the absolute differences of the labels of the endpoints. If we have an even number of 0s and 1s, the absolute differences will be 1, 2, 3, ... up to 2018. However, we need to show that at least one of these differences is a multiple of 3. 

To do this, let's think about the distribution of the labels. If we have an even number of 0s and 1s, the differences between these labels will be 1, 2, 3, ... up to 2018. But if we consider the possibility of having a 0 and a 1, the difference between them is 1, and the difference between 1 and 0 is also 1. This means that the differences 1, 2, and 3 are all possible, and we need to show that 3 is one of them. 

Since the labels are distributed in a way that the sums are all values from 0 to 2018, and the differences are also distributed in a way that includes 3, it follows that at least one blue label must be a multiple of 3. </think>
<answer> At least one blue label is a multiple of 3. </answer>","First we prove the following:

Lemma: if we color all of the points white or black, then the number of white-black edges, which we denote $E_{W B}$, is equal modulo 2 to the number of white (or black) points on the circumference, which we denote $C_{W}$, resp. $C_{B}$.

Observe that changing the colour of any interior point does not change the parity of $E_{W B}$, as each interior point has even degree, so it suffices to show the statement holds when all interior points are black. But then $E_{W B}=C_{W}$ so certainly the parities are equal.

Now returning to the original problem, assume that no two adjacent vertex labels differ by a multiple of three, and three-colour the vertices according to the residue class of the labels modulo 3. Let $E_{01}$ denote the number of edges between 0 -vertices and 1-vertices, and $C_{0}$ denote the number of 0 -vertices on the boundary, and so on.

Then, consider the two-coloring obtained by combining the 1-vertices and 2-vertices. By applying the lemma, we see that $E_{01}+E_{02} \equiv C_{0} \bmod 2$.

$$
\text { Similarly } E_{01}+E_{12} \equiv C_{1}, \quad \text { and } E_{02}+E_{12} \equiv C_{2}, \quad \bmod 2 \text {. }
$$

Using the fact that $C_{0}=C_{1}=2019$ and $C_{2}=0$, we deduce that either $E_{02}$ and $E_{12}$ are even and $E_{01}$ is odd; or $E_{02}$ and $E_{12}$ are odd and $E_{01}$ is even.

But if the edge labels are the first $N$ non-negative integers, then $E_{01}=E_{12}$ unless $N \equiv 0$ modulo 3 , in which case $E_{01}=E_{02}$. So however Alina chooses the vertex labels, it is not possible that the multiset of edge labels is $\{0, \ldots, N\}$.

Hence in fact two vertex labels must differ by a multiple of 3 .",0,True,478

Let $A B C$ be an acute-angled triangle in which $B C<A B$ and $B C<C A$. Let point $P$ lie on segment $A B$ and point $Q$ lie on segment $A C$ such that $P \neq B, Q \neq C$ and $B Q=B C=C P$. Let $T$ be the circumcentre of triangle $A P Q, H$ the orthocentre of triangle $A B C$, and $S$ the point of intersection of the lines $B Q$ and $C P$. Prove that $T, H$ and $S$ are collinear.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have an acute-angled triangle \(ABC\) with \(BC < AB\) and \(BC < CA\). Points \(P\) and \(Q\) are on segments \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively, such that \(BQ = BC = CP\). The circumcenter \(T\) of triangle \(APQ\), the orthocenter \(H\) of triangle \(ABC\), and the point \(S\) of intersection of lines \(BQ\) and \(CP\) are to be shown to be collinear. 

Since \(BQ = BC = CP\), triangles \(BQC\) and \(CPB\) are isosceles. This implies that \(BQ = BC = CP\), and thus, the angles \(\angle BQC = \angle BCP = 90^\circ - \angle BAC\). 

Next, consider the circumcenter \(T\) of triangle \(APQ\). The circumcenter is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle intersect. Since \(BQ = BC = CP\), the perpendicular bisectors of \(BQ\) and \(CP\) will intersect at a point that is equidistant from \(BQ\), \(CP\), and \(PQ\). 

Now, let's consider the orthocenter \(H\) of triangle \(ABC\). The orthocenter is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect. Since \(BQ = BC = CP\), the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\) will intersect \(BQ\) and \(CP\) at points that are symmetric with respect to the line \(BC\). 

Finally, the point \(S\) is the intersection of \(BQ\) and \(CP\). Since \(BQ = BC = CP\), the lines \(BQ\) and \(CP\) are symmetric with respect to the line \(BC\), and thus, the point \(S\) lies on the line that is the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\). 

Given the symmetry and the fact that the circumcenter \(T\) of triangle \(APQ\) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \(BQ\) and \(CP\), and the orthocenter \(H\) of triangle \(ABC\) lies on the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\), it follows that \(T\), \(H\), and \(S\) are collinear. </think>
<answer> \(T, H, S \) are collinear. </answer>","<img_3358>

We show that $T$ and $H$ are both on the angle bisector $\ell$ of $\angle B S C$.

We first prove that $H \in \ell$. The altitude $C H$ in triangle $A B C$ is also the altitude in isosceles triangle $P B C$ with $C P=C B$. Therefore, $C H$ is also the angle bisector of $\angle P C B$ and hence also of $\angle S C B$. Analogously, $B H$ is the angle bisector of $\angle S B C$. We conclude that $H$, as the intersection of two angle bisectors of $\triangle B S C$, is also on the third angle bisector, which is $\ell$.

We now prove that $T \in \ell$.

Variant 1. In the isosceles triangles $\triangle B C P$ and $\triangle C B Q$ we see that $\angle B C P=180^{\circ}-2 \angle B$ and $\angle C B Q=180^{\circ}-2 \angle C$. This yields $\angle P S Q=\angle B S C=180^{\circ}-\left(180^{\circ}-2 \angle B\right)-\left(180^{\circ}-2 \angle C\right)=$ $180^{\circ}-2 \angle A$. Furthermore, $\angle P T Q=2 \angle P A Q=2 \angle A$ ( $T$ being circumcentre of $\left.\triangle A P Q\right)$. Now $\angle P T Q+\angle P S Q=180^{\circ}$, so $P T Q S$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. From $P T=T Q$ we then obtain that $\angle P S T=\angle P Q T=\angle Q P T=\angle Q S T$, so $T$ is on the angle bisector $\angle P S Q$, which is also $\ell$.

We conclude that $T, S$ and $H$ are collinear.

Variant 2. Let $R$ be the second intersection of $B Q$ and $\odot A P Q$.

$A P R Q$ is cyclic quadrilateral, so $\angle P R S=\angle A, \angle A P R=\angle B Q C=\angle C$. On the other hand $\angle B P C=\angle B$. Therefore $\angle R P S=180^{\circ}-\angle B-\angle C=\angle A$. Hence, the triangle $P R S$ is isosceles with $S P=S R$; then $\ell$ is the perpendicular bisector of the chord $P R$ in the circle that passes through $T$.

Note that if $B Q$ is tangent to $\odot A P Q$, then $C P$ is also tangent to $\odot A P Q$ and triangle $A B C$ is isosceles, so $T, S$ and $H$ lie on the altitude from $A$.

An infinite sequence of positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots$ is called good if

(1) $a_{1}$ is a perfect square, and

(2) for any integer $n \geq 2, a_{n}$ is the smallest positive integer such that

$$
n a_{1}+(n-1) a_{2}+\ldots+2 a_{n-1}+a_{n}
$$

is a perfect square.

Prove that for any good sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots$, there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $a_{n}=a_{k}$ for all integers $n \geq k$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We know that $a_1$ is a perfect square, and for any integer $n \geq 2$, $a_n$ is the smallest positive integer such that the sum $n a_1 + (n-1) a_2 + \ldots + 2 a_{n-1} + a_n$ is a perfect square. We need to show that there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $a_n = a_k$ for all $n \geq k$.

Let's start by considering the sum for $n = 2$:
\[
2a_1 + a_2
\]
This sum must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by $m^2$. So, we have:
\[
2a_1 + a_2 = m^2
\]
Next, let's consider the sum for $n = 3$:
\[
3a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3
\]
This sum must also be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square by $n^2$. So, we have:
\[
3a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3 = n^2
\]
Now, let's consider the difference between the two sums:
\[
(3a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3) - (2a_1 + a_2) = n^2 - m^2
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = (n - m)(n + m)
\]
Since $a_1$ is a perfect square, let's assume $a_1 = k^2$ for some integer $k$. Then, we have:
\[
k^2 + a_2 + a_3 = (n - m)(n + m)
\]
Now, let's consider the possibility that $a_2 = k^2$ as well. If this is true, then:
\[
k^2 + k^2 + a_3 = (n - m)(n + m)
\]
\[
2k^2 + a_3 = (n - m)(n + m)
\]
This implies that $a_3$ must be a specific value to make the equation true. If we continue this process, we can see that the sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ will eventually repeat. This is because the structure of the sums and the requirement that each $a_n$ is the smallest integer to make the sum a perfect square will lead to a repeating pattern. </think>
<answer> ... ... ... </answer>","Define the following auxiliary sequences:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& b_{1}=a_{1}, \quad b_{n}=a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} \\
& c_{1}=b_{1}, \quad c_{n}=b_{1}+b_{2}+\cdots+b_{n} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Observe that

$$
\begin{gathered}
c_{n}-c_{n-1}=b_{n} \\
b_{n}-b_{n-1}=\left(c_{n}-c_{n-1}\right)-\left(c_{n-1}-c_{n-2}\right)=a_{n}
\end{gathered}
$$

Therefore,

$$
c_{n}=\left(2 c_{n-1}-c_{n-2}\right)+a_{n}
$$

is the smallest square greater than $2 c_{n-1}-c_{n-2}$.

Claim. $\sqrt{c_{n}}-\sqrt{c_{n-1}} \leq \sqrt{c_{n-1}}-\sqrt{c_{n-2}}$

Proof 1. Let $c_{n}=m_{n}^{2}, c_{n-1}=m_{n-1}^{2}, c_{n-2}=m_{n-2}^{2}$, where the value of $c_{n}$ is momentarily permitted to exceed its minimum. Any value is permitted for which

$$
b_{n}=c_{n}-c_{n-1}>b_{n-1}=c_{n-1}-c_{n-2}
$$

Factoring,

$$
\left(m_{n}-m_{n-1}\right)\left(m_{n}+m_{n-1}\right)>\left(m_{n-1}-m_{n-2}\right)\left(m_{n-1}+m_{n-2}\right) .
$$

In the case that $m_{n}-m_{n-1}=m_{n-1}-m_{n-2}$, this inequality clearly holds, as $m_{n}+m_{n-1}>m_{n-1}+m_{n-2}$. Thus, the minimal possible value of $m_{n}$ satisfies the claimed inequality.

Proof 2. Denote $c_{n-1}=x^{2}, c_{n-2}=(x-d)^{2}$. Then

$$
2 c_{n-1}-c_{n-2}=2 x^{2}-(x-d)^{2}=x^{2}+2 d x-d^{2}=(x+d)^{2}-2 d^{2}<(x+d)^{2} .
$$

It follows that $c_{n} \leq(x+d)^{2}$.

And so the sequence of positive integers $\sqrt{c_{n}}-\sqrt{c_{n-1}}$ is decreasing. Any such sequence is eventually constant.

As a corollary, $c_{n}=(x+n d)^{2}$ for sufficiently large $n$, with fixed integers $x$ and $d$. Along the lines above, it becomes clear that $a_{n}=c_{n}-2 c_{n-1}+c_{n-2}=2 d^{2}$, so the sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)$ is constant.",0,True,587

Let $A B C D$ be a cyclic quadrilateral with circumcentre $O$. Let the internal angle bisectors at $A$ and $B$ meet at $X$, the internal angle bisectors at $B$ and $C$ meet at $Y$, the internal angle bisectors at $C$ and $D$ meet at $Z$, and the internal angle bisectors at $D$ and $A$ meet at $W$. Further, let $A C$ and $B D$ meet at $P$. Suppose that the points $X, Y, Z, W, O$ and $P$ are distinct.

Prove that $O, X, Y, Z$ and $W$ lie on the same circle if and only if $P, X, Y, Z$ and $W$ lie on the same circle.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the angle bisectors in a cyclic quadrilateral. The internal angle bisectors of a cyclic quadrilateral intersect at the incenter of the quadrilateral, which is also the center of the circle that circumscribes the quadrilateral. This means that $O$ is the incenter of $ABCD$.

Now, let's consider the points $X, Y, Z, W$ and $P$. We need to show that if $O, X, Y, Z, W$ lie on the same circle, then $P, X, Y, Z, W$ also lie on the same circle. 

If $O, X, Y, Z, W$ lie on the same circle, then the quadrilateral $OXYZW$ is cyclic. This implies that the angles subtended by the chords $OX, OY, OZ, OW$ at the center $O$ are equal. 

Since $P$ is the intersection of $AC$ and $BD$, and $O$ is the incenter, the quadrilateral $OXYZW$ being cyclic implies that the angles subtended by the chords $OX, OY, OZ, OW$ at $P$ are also equal. This means that $P, X, Y, Z, W$ also lie on the same circle.

Conversely, if $P, X, Y, Z, W$ lie on the same circle, then the quadrilateral $PXYZW$ is cyclic. This implies that the angles subtended by the chords $PX, PY, PZ, PW$ at the center $P$ are equal. Since $O$ is the incenter, the angles subtended by the chords $OX, OY, OZ, OW$ at $P$ are also equal, which means that $O, X, Y, Z, W$ lie on the same circle.

</think>
<answer> $O, X, Y, Z$ and $W$ lie on the same circle if and only if $P, X, Y, Z$ and $W$ lie on the same circle. </answer>","Let $\Omega$ be the circumcircle of the quadrilateral $A B C D$ and let $r$ be its radius.

First, notice that the points $X, Y, Z, W$ are concyclic. Indeed, using oriented (modulo $180^{\circ}$ ) angles,

$$
\angle(X W, X Y)+\angle(Z Y, Z W)=\angle(X A, X B)+\angle(Z C, Z D)=-\frac{\angle A+\angle B}{2}-\frac{\angle C+\angle D}{2}=0 .
$$

Let $\omega$ be the circle passing through these four points. Our goal is to prove that $O \in \omega$ occurs if and only if $P \in \omega$.

Next, we rule out the case when $A B C D$ is a trapezium. Suppose that if $A B C D$ is an isosceles trapezium; without loss of generality say $A B \| C D$. By symmetry, points $X, Z, O$ and $P$ lie on the symmetry axis (that is, the common perpendicular bisector of $A B$ and $C D$ ), therefore they are collinear. By the conditions of the problem, these four points are distinct and $X$ and $Z$ are on $\omega$, so neither $O$, nor $P$ can lie on $\omega$; therefore the problem statement is obvious. From now on we assume that $A B \nparallel C D$ and $B C \nparallel A D$.

<img_3441>



Let $A B$ and $C D$ meet at $Q$, and let $B C$ and $A D$ meet at $R$. Without loss of generality, suppose that $B$ lies between $A$ and $Q$, and $D$ lies between $A$ and $R$. Now we show that line $Q R$ is the radical axis between circles $\Omega$ and $\omega$.

Point $W$ is the intersection point of the bisectors of $\angle A$ and $\angle D$, so in triangle $A D Q$, point $W$ is the incentre. Similary, $B Y$ and $C Y$ are the external bisectors of $\angle Q B C$ and $\angle B C Q$, so in triangle $B C Q$, point $Y$ is the excentre opposite to $Q$. Hence, both $Y$ and $W$ lie on the bisector of $\angle D Q A$.

By $\angle D Q A=180^{\circ}-\angle D-\angle A=\angle B-\angle A$ we get

$$
\angle B Y Q=\angle Y B A-\angle Y Q B=\frac{\angle B}{2}-\frac{\angle D Q A}{2}=\frac{\angle B}{2}-\frac{\angle B-\angle A}{2}=\frac{\angle A}{2}=\angle B A W
$$

so the points $A, B, Y, W$ are concyclic, and therefore $Q A \cdot Q B=Q Y \cdot Q W$; hence, $Q$ has equal power with respect to $\Omega$ and $\omega$. It can be seen similarly that $R$ has equal power with respect to the circles $\Omega$ and $\omega$. Hence, the radical axis of $\Omega$ and $\omega$ is line $Q R$.

Let lines $O P$ and $Q R$ meet at point $S$. It is well-known that with respect to circle $A B C D$, the diagonal triangle $P Q R$ is autopolar. As consequences we have $O P \perp Q R$, and the points $P$ and $S$ are symmetric to circle $A B C D$, so $O S \cdot O P=r^{2}$.

Notice that $P$ and $O$ lie inside $\Omega$, so the polar line $Q R$ lies entirely outside, so $S$ is different from $P$ and $O$. Moreover,

$$
S O \cdot S P=O S \cdot(O S-O P)=O S^{2}-O S \cdot O P=S O^{2}-r^{2}
$$

so $S O \cdot S P$ is equal to the power of $S$ with respect to $\Omega$. Since $S$ lies on the radical axis $Q R$, it has equal power with respect to the two circles; therefore, $S O \cdot S P$ is equal to the power of $S$ with respect to $\omega$. From this, it follows that $O \in \omega$ if and only if $P \in \omega$.",0,False,445

If we draw the perpendicular from \(B\) to \(AC\), let's call the foot of the perpendicular \(F\). Since \(AE = 2CA\), the point \(F\) will be closer to \(A\) than to \(C\). The distance from \(B\) to \(F\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in the right-angled triangle \(BFC\).

Since \(BD = 2BC\), and considering the extension, the distance from \(D\) to the perpendicular from \(B\) to \(AC\) will also be calculated in a similar manner. The key is to recognize that the distances and the extensions create a configuration where the perpendicular from \(B\) to \(AC\) is exactly the distance that would make the triangle right-angled when combined with the given conditions.

Let $n$ be a positive integer.
Prove that there exists a set $S$ of $6 n$ pairwise different positive integers, such that the least common multiple of any two elements of $S$ is no larger than $32 n^{2}$.

A good strategy is to use numbers that are close to each other and have a small LCM. We can start by considering the numbers $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 6n$. However, the LCM of any two of these numbers is at least $6n$, which is too large. We need to modify these numbers to get a smaller LCM. 

One way to achieve this is to use fractions or products that are close to integers but not integers themselves.

Let the elements of $U$ be $u_{1}>u_{2}>\cdots>u_{m+1} \geqslant m$. Note that $1 / u_{1} \leqslant 1 / u_{i} \leqslant 1 / m$ for $1 \leqslant i \leqslant m+1$. We partition the interval $\left[1 / u_{1} ; 1 / m\right]$ into $m$ subintervals of equal length. By the pigeonhole principle, there exist indices $i, j$ with $1 \leqslant i<j \leqslant m+1$ such that $1 / u_{i}$ and $1 / u_{j}$ belong to the same subinterval. Hence

$$
0<\frac{1}{u_{j}}-\frac{1}{u_{i}} \leqslant \frac{1}{m}\left(\frac{1}{m}-\frac{1}{u_{1}}\right)<\frac{1}{m^{2}}
$$

Now $1 / u_{j}-1 / u_{i}$ is a positive fraction with denominator $\operatorname{lcm}\left(u_{i}, u_{j}\right)$. The above thus yields the lower bound $\operatorname{lcm}\left(u_{i}, u_{j}\right)>m^{2}$, completing the proof of the lemma.

Applying the lemma with $m=3 n$ to the $3 n+1$ largest elements of $T$, which are all not less than $3 n$, we arrive at the desired statement.

Let $u_{1}>u_{2}>\cdots>u_{m}$ be the elements of $U$. Since $u_{m}>m=m^{2} / m$, there exists a smallest index $k$ such that $u_{k}>m^{2} / k$. If $k=1$, then $u_{1}>m^{2}$, and the least common multiple of $u_{1}$ and $u_{2}$ is strictly larger than $m^{2}$. So let us suppose $k>1$ from now on, so that we have $u_{k}>m^{2} / k$ and $u_{k-1} \leqslant m^{2} /(k-1)$. The greatest common divisor $d$ of $u_{k-1}$ and $u_{k}$ satisfies

$$
d \leqslant u_{k-1}-u_{k}<\frac{m^{2}}{k-1}-\frac{m^{2}}{k}=\frac{m^{2}}{(k-1) k}
$$



This implies $m^{2} /(d k)>k-1$ and $u_{k} / d>k-1$, and hence $u_{k} / d \geqslant k$. But then the least common multiple of $u_{k-1}$ and $u_{k}$ equals

$$
\frac{u_{k-1} u_{k}}{d} \geqslant u_{k} \cdot \frac{u_{k}}{d}>\frac{m^{2}}{k} \cdot k=m^{2}
$$

and the proof of the lemma is complete.

If we remove the $3 n$ smallest elements from set $T$ and apply the lemma with $m=3 n$ to the remaining elements, we arrive at the desired statement.",0,False,339

Let $\Omega$ be the circumcircle of the triangle $A B C$. The circle $\omega$ is tangent to the sides $A C$ and $B C$, and it is internally tangent to $\Omega$ at the point $P$. A line parallel to $A B$ and intersecting the interior of triangle $A B C$ is tangent to $\omega$ at $Q$.

Prove that $\angle A C P=\angle Q C B$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information. We have a triangle \(ABC\) with its circumcircle \(\Omega\). A circle \(\omega\) is tangent to sides \(AC\) and \(BC\) and is internally tangent to \(\Omega\) at point \(P\). A line parallel to \(AB\) intersects the interior of \(\triangle ABC\) at point \(Q\), and this line is tangent to \(\omega\) at \(Q\).

Since \(\omega\) is tangent to \(AC\) and \(BC\), and the line through \(Q\) is parallel to \(AB\), it follows that \(\omega\) is also tangent to the line through \(Q\). This implies that the line through \(Q\) is parallel to the line through the points of tangency of \(\omega\) with \(AC\) and \(BC\).

Now, consider the angles formed by the tangents and the sides of the triangle. The angle \(\angle ACP\) is the angle between the tangent to \(\omega\) at \(P\) and the side \(AC\). Similarly, \(\angle QCB\) is the angle between the tangent to \(\omega\) at \(Q\) and the side \(BC\). Since the line through \(Q\) is parallel to \(AB\), the angles \(\angle ACP\) and \(\angle QCB\) are corresponding angles when considering the parallel lines and the transversal. Therefore, \(\angle ACP = \angle QCB\). </think>
<answer> \angle ACP = \angle QCB </answer>","Assume that $\omega$ is tangent to $A C$ and $B C$ at $E$ and $F$, respectively and let $P E, P F, P Q$ meet $\Omega$ at $K, L, M$, respectively. Let $I$ and $O$ denote the respective centres of $\omega$ and $\Omega$, and consider the homethety $\mathscr{H}$ that maps $\omega$ onto $\Omega$. Now $K$ is the image of $E$ under $\mathscr{H}$, and $E I \perp A C$. Hence $O K \perp A C$, and thus $K$ is the midpoint of the arc $C A$. Similarly, $L$ is the midpoint of the $\operatorname{arc} B C$ and $M$ is the midpoint of the arc $B A$. It follows that arcs $L M$ and $C K$ are equal, because

$$
\begin{aligned}
\overparen{B M}=\overparen{M A} & \Longrightarrow \overparen{B L}+\overparen{L M}=\overparen{M K}+\overparen{K A} \Longrightarrow \overparen{L C}+\overparen{L M}=\overparen{M K}+\overparen{C K} \\
& \Longrightarrow 2 \overparen{L M}+\overparen{M C}=\overparen{M C}+2 \overparen{C K} \Longrightarrow \overparen{L M}=\overparen{C K}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus arcs $F Q$ and $D E$ of $\omega$ are equal, too, where $D$ is the intersection of $C P$ with $\omega$. Since $C E$ and $C F$ are tangents to $\omega$, this implies that $\angle D E C=\angle C F Q$. Further, $C E=C F$, and thus triangles $C E D$ and $C F Q$ are congruent. In particular, $\angle E C D=\angle Q C F$, as required.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarves are living in their house in the forest. On each of 16 consecutive days, some of the dwarves worked in the diamond mine while the remaining dwarves collected berries in the forest. No dwarf performed both types of work on the same day. On any two different (not necessarily consecutive) days, at least three dwarves each performed both types of work. Further, on the first day, all seven dwarves worked in the diamond mine.

Prove that, on one of these 16 days, all seven dwarves were collecting berries.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We know that on the first day, all seven dwarves worked in the diamond mine. On any two different days, at least three dwarves each performed both types of work. We need to prove that on one of these 16 days, all seven dwarves were collecting berries.

Let's consider the days when the dwarves are working in the diamond mine. If we denote the days when the dwarves are working in the diamond mine as \(D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_k\), and the days when they are collecting berries as \(B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_{16-k}\), we need to ensure that on some day, all seven dwarves are collecting berries.

Since at least three dwarves each perform both types of work on any two different days, let's consider the days when the dwarves are working in the diamond mine. If we have a day when three dwarves are working in the diamond mine, and another day when three other dwarves are working in the diamond mine, then on the day when all seven dwarves are working in the diamond mine, it means that the remaining four dwarves are collecting berries. This is because if any of the remaining dwarves were working in the diamond mine, it would violate the condition that at least three dwarves each perform both types of work on any two different days.

</think>
<answer> On one of these 16 days, all seven dwarves were collecting berries. </answer>","We define $V$ as the set of all 128 vectors of length 7 with entries in $\{0,1\}$. Every such vector encodes the work schedule of a single day: if the $i$-th entry is 0 then the $i$-th dwarf works in the mine, and if this entry is 1 then the $i$-th dwarf collects berries. The 16 working days correspond to 16 vectors $d_{1}, \ldots, d_{16}$ in $V$, which we will call dayvectors. The condition imposed on any pair of distinct days means that any two distinct day-vectors $d_{i}$ and $d_{j}$ differ in at least three positions.

We say that a vector $x \in V$ covers some vector $y \in V$, if $x$ and $y$ differ in at most one position; note that every vector in $V$ covers exactly eight vectors. For each of the 16 day-vectors $d_{i}$ we define $B_{i} \subset V$ as the set of the eight vectors that are covered by $d_{i}$. As, for $i \neq j$, the day-vectors $d_{i}$ and $d_{j}$ differ in at least three positions, their corresponding sets $B_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ are disjoint. As the sets $B_{1}, \ldots, B_{16}$ together contain $16 \cdot 8=128=|V|$ distinct elements, they form a partition of $V$; in other words, every vector in $V$ is covered by precisely one day-vector.

The weight of a vector $v \in V$ is defined as the number of 1-entries in $v$. For $k=0,1, \ldots, 7$, the set $V$ contains $\left(\begin{array}{l}7 \\ k\end{array}\right)$ vectors of weight $k$. Let us analyse the 16 dayvectors $d_{1}, \ldots, d_{16}$ by their weights, and let us discuss how the vectors in $V$ are covered by them.

1. As all seven dwarves work in the diamond mine on the first day, the first day-vector is $d_{1}=(0000000)$. This day-vector covers all vectors in $V$ with weight 0 or 1.
2. No day-vector can have weight 2 , as otherwise it would differ from $d_{1}$ in at most two positions. Hence each of the $\left(\begin{array}{l}7 \\ 2\end{array}\right)=21$ vectors of weight 2 must be covered by some day-vector of weight 3 . As every vector of weight 3 covers three vectors of weight 2 , exactly $21 / 3=7$ day-vectors have weight 3 .
3. How are the $\left(\begin{array}{l}7 \\ 3\end{array}\right)=35$ vectors of weight 3 covered by the day-vectors? Seven of them are day-vectors, and the remaining 28 ones must be covered by day-vectors of weight 4 . As every vector of weight 4 covers four vectors of weight 3 , exactly $28 / 4=7$ day-vectors have weight 4.


To summarize, one day-vector has weight 0 , seven have weight 3 , and seven have weight 4 . None of these 15 day-vectors covers any vector of weight 6 or 7 , so that the eight heavyweight vectors in $V$ must be covered by the only remaining day-vector; and this remaining vector must be (1111111). On the day corresponding to (1111111) all seven dwarves are collecting berries, and that is what we wanted to show.",0,False,321

Let $\triangle A B C$ be an acute-angled triangle, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$. The angle bisector of $\angle A B C$ intersects $C D$ at $E$ and meets the circumcircle $\omega$ of triangle $\triangle A D E$ again at $F$. If $\angle A D F=45^{\circ}$, show that $C F$ is tangent to $\omega$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric properties involved. We know that $D$ is the foot of the altitude from $C$ to $AB$, and $E$ is the intersection of the angle bisector of $\angle ABC$ with $CD$. The angle bisector of $\angle ABC$ intersects the circumcircle $\omega$ of $\triangle ADE$ again at $F$. We are given that $\angle ADF = 45^\circ$ and need to show that $CF$ is tangent to $\omega$.

Since $F$ lies on the circumcircle $\omega$ of $\triangle ADE$, and $\angle ADF = 45^\circ$, we can infer that $\angle ADE = 45^\circ$ because the angle subtended by the arc $AD$ at the circumference is equal to the angle subtended by the same arc at the center (which is $90^\circ$ in this case, but considering the properties of the circle and the angle bisector, it simplifies to $45^\circ$).

Now, let's consider the point $C$. Since $CD$ is perpendicular to $AB$ and $E$ lies on $CD$, and given that $F$ is on the circumcircle $\omega$ of $\triangle ADE$, we need to check the tangency condition. 

If we consider the cyclic quadrilateral $AFDE$, and knowing that $\angle ADF = 45^\circ$, we can use the fact that the angle subtended by the arc $AF$ at the center of the circle is $90^\circ$ (since $F$ is on the circle and $A$ and $D$ are on the circle), which implies that $CF$ is perpendicular to the radius at $F$. This perpendicularity at $F$ means that $CF$ is tangent to the circle $\omega$ at $F$.

</think>
<answer> $CF$ is tangent to $\omega$ </answer>","<img_3521>
Since $\angle C D F=90^{\circ}-45^{\circ}=45^{\circ}$, the line $D F$ bisects $\angle C D A$, and so $F$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment $A E$, which meets $A B$ at $G$. Let $\angle A B C=2 \beta$. Since $A D E F$ is cyclic, $\angle A F E=90^{\circ}$, and hence $\angle F A E=45^{\circ}$. Further, as $B F$ bisects $\angle A B C$, we have $\angle F A B=90^{\circ}-\beta$, and thus

$$
\angle E A B=\angle A E G=45^{\circ}-\beta, \quad \text { and } \quad \angle A E D=45^{\circ}+\beta \text {, }
$$

so $\angle G E D=2 \beta$. This implies that right-angled triangles $\triangle E D G$ and $\triangle B D C$ are similar, and so we have $|G D| /|C D|=|D E| /|D B|$. Thus the right-angled triangles $\triangle D E B$ and $\triangle D G C$ are similar, whence $\angle G C D=\angle D B E=\beta$. But $\angle D F E=\angle D A E=45^{\circ}-$ $\beta$, then $\angle G F D=45^{\circ}-\angle D F E=\beta$. Hence $G D C F$ is cyclic, so $\angle G F C=90^{\circ}$, whence $C F$ is perpendicular to the radius $F G$ of $\omega$.

It follows that $C F$ is a tangent to $\omega$, as required.",0,False,415

Let $n, m$ be integers greater than 1 , and let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{m}$ be positive integers not greater than $n^{m}$. Prove that there exist positive integers $b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots, b_{m}$ not greater than $n$, such that

$$
\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{1}+b_{1}, a_{2}+b_{2}, \ldots, a_{m}+b_{m}\right)<n

where $\operatorname{gcd}\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{m}\right)$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{m}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m$ and the integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$ that we need to find. We need to ensure that the greatest common divisor of the numbers $a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, \ldots, a_m + b_m$ is less than $n$. 

One way to approach this is to consider the possibility that $b_i = k_i$ for some integers $k_i$ that are less than $n$. If we can find such $k_i$ that make the gcd of the numbers $a_1 + k_1, a_2 + k_2, \ldots, a_m + k_m$ less than $n$, then we are done. 

Let's try to find such $k_i$. Since $a_i$ are positive integers not greater than $n^m$, and $k_i$ are integers not greater than $n$, the sum $a_i + k_i$ will be an integer not greater than $n^m + n$. 

Now, if we can find $k_i$ such that the gcd of the numbers $a_1 + k_1, a_2 + k_2, \ldots, a_m + k_m$ is less than $n$, then we are done. 

One way to achieve this is to consider the possibility that $k_i = n - 1$ for all $i$. This gives us the numbers $a_i + (n - 1)$. The gcd of these numbers will be less than $n$ because the sum of any two of these numbers will be less than $2n$, and the gcd of any two numbers in this set will be less than $n$. </think>
<answer> (a_1 + (n - 1)), (a_2 + (n - 1)), \ldots, (a_m + (n - 1)) </answer>","Suppose without loss of generality that $a_{1}$ is the smallest of the $a_{i}$. If $a_{1} \geq n^{m}-1$, then the problem is simple: either all the $a_{i}$ are equal, or $a_{1}=n^{m}-1$ and $a_{j}=n^{m}$ for some $j$. In the first case, we can take (say) $b_{1}=1, b_{2}=2$, and the rest of the $b_{i}$ can be arbitrary, and we have

$$
\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{1}+b_{1}, a_{2}+b_{2}, \ldots, a_{m}+b_{m}\right) \leq \operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{1}+b_{1}, a_{2}+b_{2}\right)=1
$$

In the second case, we can take $b_{1}=1, b_{j}=1$, and the rest of the $b_{i}$ arbitrary, and again

$$
\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{1}+b_{1}, a_{2}+b_{2}, \ldots, a_{m}+b_{m}\right) \leq \operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{1}+b_{1}, a_{j}+b_{j}\right)=1
$$

So from now on we can suppose that $a_{1} \leq n^{m}-2$.

Now, let us suppose the desired $b_{1}, \ldots, b_{m}$ do not exist, and seek a contradiction. Then, for any choice of $b_{1}, \ldots, b_{m} \in\{1, \ldots, n\}$, we have

$$
\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{1}+b_{1}, a_{2}+b_{2}, \ldots, a_{m}+b_{m}\right) \geq n \text {. }
$$

Also, we have

$$
\operatorname{gcd}\left(a_{1}+b_{1}, a_{2}+b_{2}, \ldots, a_{m}+b_{m}\right) \leq a_{1}+b_{1} \leq n^{m}+n-2
$$

Thus there are at most $n^{m}-1$ possible values for the greatest common divisor. However, there are $n^{m}$ choices for the $m$-tuple $\left(b_{1}, \ldots, b_{m}\right)$. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, there are two $m$-tuples that yield the same values for the greatest common divisor, say $d$. But since $d \geq n$, for each $i$ there can be at most one choice of $b_{i} \in\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ such that $a_{i}+b_{i}$ is divisible by $d$ - and therefore there can be at most one $m$-tuple $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots, b_{m}\right)$ yielding $d$ as the greatest common divisor.

Determine whether there exists an infinite sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots$ of positive integers which satisfies the equality

Let's start by examining the first few terms of the sequence. If we assume \(a_1 = 1\) and \(a_2 = 1\), then:
- For \(n = 1\), we have \(a_3 = a_2 + \sqrt{a_2 + a_1} = 1 + \sqrt{1 + 1} = 1 + \sqrt{2}\), which is not an integer.
- This suggests that our initial assumption of \(a_1 = 1\) and \(a_2 = 1\) might not work. </think>
<answer> ... ... ... </answer>","The answer is no.

Suppose that there exists a sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)$ of positive integers satisfying the given condition. We will show that this will lead to a contradiction.

For each $n \geq 2$ define $b_{n}=a_{n+1}-a_{n}$. Then, by assumption, for $n \geq 2$ we get $b_{n}=\sqrt{a_{n}+a_{n-1}}$ so that we have

$$
b_{n+1}^{2}-b_{n}^{2}=\left(a_{n+1}+a_{n}\right)-\left(a_{n}+a_{n-1}\right)=\left(a_{n+1}-a_{n}\right)+\left(a_{n}-a_{n-1}\right)=b_{n}+b_{n-1} .
$$

Since each $a_{n}$ is a positive integer we see that $b_{n}$ is positive integer for $n \geq 2$ and the sequence $\left(b_{n}\right)$ is strictly increasing for $n \geq 3$. Thus $b_{n}+b_{n-1}=\left(b_{n+1}-b_{n}\right)\left(b_{n+1}+b_{n}\right) \geq b_{n+1}+b_{n}$, whence $b_{n-1} \geq b_{n+1}$ - a contradiction to increasing of the sequence $\left(b_{i}\right)$.

Let $m, n$ be positive integers with $m>1$. Anastasia partitions the integers $1,2, \ldots, 2 m$ into $m$ pairs. Boris then chooses one integer from each pair and finds the sum of these chosen integers. Prove that Anastasia can select the pairs so that Boris cannot make his sum equal to $n$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the sum of all integers from 1 to $2m$. This sum is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[
1 + 2 + \cdots + 2m = \frac{2m(2m + 1)}{2} = m(2m + 1).
\]
Boris chooses one integer from each of the $m$ pairs, and the sum of these chosen integers is $n$. If Anastasia can partition the integers in such a way that the sum of the chosen integers is never equal to $n$, then we have proven the statement. 

Now, let's think about the possible values of $n$. Since $n$ is the sum of one integer from each pair, $n$ must be an integer between 1 and $2m$. We need to show that for any $n$ in this range, there is a way to partition the integers so that the sum of the chosen integers is not $n$.

Consider the following strategy: Anastasia can pair the integers in a way that the sum of the integers in each pair is as far from $n$ as possible. If we can ensure that the sum of the integers in each pair is not $n$, then the sum of the chosen integers from each pair will also not be $n$.

For example, if $m = 3$ and $n = 5$, the integers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Anastasia can pair them as (1, 6), (2, 5), and (3, 4). The sum of the integers in each pair is 7, 7, and 7 respectively, which is not 5. </think>
<answer> (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), \ldots, (m, 2m) </answer>","Define the following ordered partitions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P_{1}=(\{1,2\},\{3,4\}, \ldots,\{2 m-1,2 m\}), \\
& P_{2}=(\{1, m+1\},\{2, m+2\}, \ldots,\{m, 2 m\}), \\
& P_{3}=(\{1,2 m\},\{2, m+1\},\{3, m+2\}, \ldots,\{m, 2 m-1\}) .
\end{aligned}
$$

For each $P_{j}$ we will compute the possible values for the expression $s=a_{1}+\ldots+a_{m}$, where $a_{i} \in P_{j, i}$ are the chosen integers. Here, $P_{j, i}$ denotes the $i$-th coordinate of the ordered partition $P_{j}$.

We will denote by $\sigma$ the number $\sum_{i=1}^{m} i=\left(m^{2}+m\right) / 2$.

- Consider the partition $P_{1}$ and a certain choice with corresponding sum $s$. We find that

$$
m^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{m}(2 i-1) \leq s \leq \sum_{i=1}^{m} 2 i=m^{2}+m
$$

Hence, if $n<m^{2}$ or $n>m^{2}+m$, this partition gives a positive answer.

- Consider the partition $P_{2}$ and a certain choice with corresponding $s$. We find that

$$
s \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{m} i \equiv \sigma \quad(\bmod m)
$$

Hence, if $m^{2} \leq n \leq m^{2}+m$ and $n \not \equiv \sigma(\bmod m)$, this partition solves the problem.

- Consider the partition $P_{3}$ and a certain choice with corresponding $s$. We set

$$
d_{i}= \begin{cases}0 & \text { if } a_{i}=i \\ 1, & \text { if } a_{i} \neq i\end{cases}
$$

We also put $d=\sum_{i=1}^{m} d_{i}$, and note that $0 \leq d \leq m$. Note also that if $a_{i} \neq i$, then $a_{i} \equiv i-1$ $(\bmod m)$. Hence, for all $a_{i} \in P_{3, i}$ it holds that

$$
a_{i} \equiv i-d_{i} \quad(\bmod m)
$$

Hence,

$$
s \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{i} \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{m}\left(i-d_{i}\right) \equiv \sigma-d \quad(\bmod m)
$$

which can only be congruent to $\sigma$ modulo $m$ if all $d_{i}$ are equal, which forces $s=\left(m^{2}+m\right) / 2$ or $s=\left(3 m^{2}+m\right) / 2$. Since $m>1$, it holds that

$$
\frac{m^{2}+m}{2}<m^{2}<m^{2}+m<\frac{3 m^{2}+m}{2} \text {. }
$$

Hence if $m^{2} \leq n \leq m^{2}+m$ and $n \equiv \sigma(\bmod m)$, then $s$ cannot be equal to $n$, so partition $P_{3}$ suffices for such $n$.



Note that all $n$ are treated in one of the cases above, so we are done.",0,False,406

For each $1 \leqslant i \leqslant n$ we let $b_{i}=\frac{a_{i-1}+a_{i+1}}{a_{i}}$ (here we define $a_{0}$ to be $a_{n}$ and $a_{n+1}$ to be $a_{1}$ ). Assume that for all $i$ and $j$ in the range 1 to $n$, we have $a_{i} \leqslant a_{j}$ if and only if $b_{i} \leqslant b_{j}$.

Prove that $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the given conditions. We have a sequence of positive real numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and a sequence of numbers $b_i$ defined by $b_i = \frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{a_i}$, with $a_0 = a_n$ and $a_{n+1} = a_1$. The condition given is that for all $i$ and $j$, $a_i \leq a_j$ if and only if $b_i \leq b_j$.

Let's start by considering the possibility that $a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_n$. If this is true, then $b_i = \frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{a_i} = \frac{a + a}{a} = 2$ for all $i$. This satisfies the condition that $b_i \leq b_j$ if and only if $a_i \leq a_j$.

Now, let's consider the case where $a_1 \neq a_2 = \cdots = a_n$. We need to show that this leads to a contradiction. Suppose $a_1 > a_2 = \cdots = a_n$. Then, $b_1 = \frac{a_0 + a_2}{a_1} = \frac{a_n + a_2}{a_1} < 1$ because $a_1 > a_2$. This would imply that $b_1 < b_2$, which contradicts the given condition that $a_1 \leq a_2$ if and only if $b_1 \leq b_2$. A similar argument holds if $a_1 < a_2 = \cdots = a_n$.

Therefore, the only way to satisfy the given conditions is if $a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_n$.
<answer>","Suppose that not all $a_{i}$ are equal. Consider an index $i$ such that $a_{i}$ is maximal and $a_{i+1}<a_{i}$. Then

$$
b_{i}=\frac{a_{i-1}+a_{i+1}}{a_{i}}<\frac{2 a_{i}}{a_{i}}=2
$$

But since $a_{i}$ is maximal, $b_{i}$ is also maximal, so we must have $b_{j}<2$ for all $j \in\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$.

However, consider the product $b_{1} b_{2} \ldots b_{n}$. We have

$$
\begin{aligned}
b_{1} b_{2} \ldots b_{n} & =\frac{a_{n}+a_{2}}{a_{1}} \cdot \frac{a_{1}+a_{3}}{a_{2}} \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{a_{n-1}+a_{1}}{a_{n}} \\
& \geqslant 2^{n} \frac{\sqrt{a_{n} a_{2}} \sqrt{a_{1} a_{3}} \ldots \sqrt{a_{n-1} a_{1}}}{a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}} \\
& =2^{n},
\end{aligned}
$$

where we used the inequality $x+y \geqslant 2 \sqrt{x y}$ for $x=a_{i-1}, y=a_{i+1}$ for all $i \in\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$ in the second row.

Since the product of all $b_{i}$ is at least $2^{n}$, at least one of them must be greater than 2 , which is a contradiction with the previous conclusion.

Thus, all $a_{i}$ must be equal.",0,False,434

We are given an acute triangle $A B C$. Let $D$ be the point on its circumcircle such that $A D$ is a diameter. Suppose that points $K$ and $L$ lie on segments $A B$ and $A C$, respectively, and that $D K$ and $D L$ are tangent to circle $A K L$.

Show that line $K L$ passes through the orthocentre of $A B C$.

The altitudes of a triangle meet at its orthocentre.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of the given points and the circle. Since $D$ is on the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ and $AD$ is a diameter, $\angle ABD = \angle ACD = 90^\circ$. This means that $D$ is the point where the perpendiculars from $B$ and $C$ to $AC$ and $AB$ respectively, intersect the circumcircle. 

Given that $DK$ and $DL$ are tangent to the circle $AKL$, we can use the fact that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. This implies that $DK = DL$. 

Now, let's consider the orthocenter $H$ of $\triangle ABC$. The orthocenter is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect. We need to show that $KL$ passes through $H$.

Since $D$ is on the circumcircle and $AD$ is a diameter, $D$ is the point where the perpendicular from $A$ to the line $BC$ intersects the circumcircle. The tangents $DK$ and $DL$ being equal in length and the fact that they are from points $K$ and $L$ on $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, suggests that $K$ and $L$ are symmetric with respect to the line $AH$ (where $H$ is the orthocenter). 

This symmetry and the fact that $D$ is the midpoint of the arc $BC$ not containing $A$ (since $AD$ is a diameter), implies that $KL$ is parallel to $BC$ and passes through the orthocenter $H$ when extended. </think>
<answer> $KL$ passes through the orthocenter $H$ of $\triangle ABC$ </answer>","<img_3471>
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $K L$. We will prove that $M$ is the orthocentre of $A B C$. Since $D K$ and $D L$ are tangent to the same circle, $|D K|=|D L|$ and hence $D M \perp K L$. The theorem of Thales in circle $A B C$ also gives $D B \perp B A$ and $D C \perp C A$. The right angles then give that quadrilaterals $B D M K$ and $D M L C$ are cyclic.

If $\angle B A C=\alpha$, then clearly $\angle D K M=\angle M L D=\alpha$ by angle in the alternate segment of circle $A K L$, and so $\angle M D K=\angle L D M=\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha$, which thanks to cyclic quadrilaterals gives $\angle M B K=\angle L C M=\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha$. From this, we have $B M \perp A C$ and $C M \perp A B$, and so $M$ indeed is the orthocentre of $A B C$.",0,False,377

We are given a positive integer $s \geqslant 2$. For each positive integer $k$, we define its twist $k^{\prime}$ as follows: write $k$ as $a s+b$, where $a, b$ are non-negative integers and $b<s$, then $k^{\prime}=b s+a$. For the positive integer $n$, consider the infinite sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \ldots$ where $d_{1}=n$ and $d_{i+1}$ is the twist of $d_{i}$ for each positive integer $i$.

Prove that this sequence contains 1 if and only if the remainder when $n$ is divided by $s^{2}-1$ is either 1 or $s$.

","First, let's consider the sequence $d_1, d_2, \ldots$ where $d_1 = n$ and $d_{i+1}$ is the twist of $d_i$. We need to show that the sequence contains 1 if and only if the remainder when $n$ is divided by $s^2 - 1$ is either 1 or $s$.

### Proof of ""If the remainder when $n$ is divided by $s^2 - 1$ is 1 or $s$, then the sequence contains 1.""
If the remainder when $n$ is divided by $s^2 - 1$ is 1, then $n = k(s^2 - 1) + 1$ for some integer $k$. We need to show that $1$ appears in the sequence. We can start by checking the first few terms:
- $d_1 = n = k(s^2 - 1) + 1$
- $d_2 = k(s^2 - 1) + 1^{\prime} = k(s^2 - 1) + s + k = k(s^2 - 1 + s) + k$
- $d_3 = k(s^2 - 1 + s) + k^{\prime} = k(s^2 - 1 + s + s) = k(s^2 + s - 1)$

### Proof of ""If the sequence contains 1, then the remainder when $n$ is divided by $s^2 - 1$ is 1 or $s$.""
If the sequence contains 1, then there exists some $i$ such that $d_i = 1$. Let's consider the possible values of $i$:
- If $i = 1$, then $d_1 = 1$, so $n = k(s^2 - 1) + 1$.
- If $i > 1$, then $d_i = k^{\prime} = b s + a$ for some $a, b$ where $a, b$ are non-negative integers and $b < s$. This implies that $k^{\prime} = k(s - 1) + k$ when $i = 2$, and so on. This means that $n$ can be expressed in a form that when divided by $s^2 - 1$, leaves a remainder of 1 or $s$.

\[
\boxed{\text{The sequence contains 1 if and only if the remainder when } n \text{ is divided by } s^2 - 1 \text{ is either 1 or } s.}
\]","First, we consider the difference $k-k^{\prime \prime}$. If $k=a s+b$ as in the problem statement, then $k^{\prime}=b s+a$. We write $a=l s+m$ with $m, l$ non-negative numbers and $m \leq s-1$. This gives $k^{\prime \prime}=m s+(b+l)$ and hence $k-k^{\prime \prime}=(a-m) s-l=l\left(s^{2}-1\right)$.

We conclude

Fact 1.1. $k \geq k^{\prime \prime}$ for every every $k \geq 1$

Fact 1.2. $s^{2}-1$ divides the difference $k-k^{\prime \prime}$.

Fact 1.2 implies that the sequences $d_{1}, d_{3}, d_{5}, \ldots$ and $d_{2}, d_{4}, d_{6}, \ldots$ are constant modulo $s^{2}-1$. Moreover, Fact 1.1 says that the sequences are (weakly) decreasing and hence eventually constant. In other words, the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, d_{3}, \ldots$ is 2 -periodic modulo $s^{2}-1$ (from the start) and is eventually 2-periodic.

Now, assume that some term in the sequence is equal to 1 . The next term is equal to $1^{\prime}=s$ and since the sequence is 2 -periodic from the start modulo $s^{2}-1$, we conclude that $d_{1}$ is either equal to 1 or $s$ modulo $s^{2}-1$. This proves the first implication.

To prove the other direction, assume that $d_{1}$ is congruent to 1 or $s$ modulo $s^{2}-1$. We need the observation that once one of the sequences $d_{1}, d_{3}, d_{5}, \ldots$ or $d_{2}, d_{4}, d_{6}, \ldots$ stabilises, then their value is less than $s^{2}$. This is implied by the following fact.

Fact 1.3. If $k=k^{\prime \prime}$, then $k=k^{\prime \prime}<s^{2}$.

Proof. We use the expression for $k-k^{\prime \prime}$ found before. If $k=k^{\prime \prime}$, then $l=0$, and so $k^{\prime \prime}=m s+b$. Both $m$ and $b$ are reminders after division by $s$, so they are both $\leq s-1$. This gives $k^{\prime \prime} \leq(s-1) s+(s-1)<s^{2}$.

Using Fact 1.2, it follows that the sequence $d_{1}, d_{3}, d_{5}, \ldots$ is constant to 1 or $s$ modulo $s^{2}-1$ and stabilises to 1 or $s$ by Fact 1.3. Since $s^{\prime}=1$, we conclude that the sequence contains a 1.",0,True,567

Let $A B C$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\Omega$. Let $S_{b}$ and $S_{c}$ respectively denote the midpoints of the $\operatorname{arcs} A C$ and $A B$ that do not contain the third vertex. Let $N_{a}$ denote the midpoint of arc $B A C$ (the arc $B C$ containing $A$ ). Let $I$ be the incentre of $A B C$. Let $\omega_{b}$ be the circle that is tangent to $A B$ and internally tangent to $\Omega$ at $S_{b}$, and let $\omega_{c}$ be the circle that is tangent to $A C$ and internally tangent to $\Omega$ at $S_{c}$. Show that the line $I N_{a}$, and the line through the intersections of $\omega_{b}$ and $\omega_{c}$, meet on $\Omega$.

The incentre of a triangle is the centre of its incircle, the circle inside the triangle that is tangent to all three sides.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the geometric properties and relationships between the points and circles involved. The points $S_b$ and $S_c$ are the midpoints of the arcs $AC$ and $AB$ respectively, excluding the third vertex. The point $N_a$ is the midpoint of the arc $BAC$ that contains $A$. The incentre $I$ is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle meet. The circles $\omega_b$ and $\omega_c$ are tangent to the sides $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, and internally tangent to the circumcircle $\Omega$ at $S_b$ and $S_c$.

The key observation is that the line $IN_a$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ and it passes through the midpoint of the arc $BAC$. The line through the intersections of $\omega_b$ and $\omega_c$ is the radical axis of these two circles. The radical axis of two circles is the locus of points that have equal power with respect to both circles. 

Since $\omega_b$ and $\omega_c$ are tangent to $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, and internally tangent to $\Omega$ at $S_b$ and $S_c$, the radical axis of $\omega_b$ and $\omega_c$ is the line that is perpendicular to the line joining the points of tangency $S_b$ and $S_c$. This line intersects the circumcircle $\Omega$ at two points, and one of these points is the intersection of the line $IN_a$ with $\Omega$.

</think>
<answer> The line $IN_a$ and the line through the intersections of $\omega_b$ and $\omega_c$ meet on $\Omega$ at a point. </answer>","<img_3378>

Part I: First we show that A lies on the radical axis of $\omega_{b}$ and $\omega_{c}$.

We first note that the line through the intersections of two circles is the radical line of the two circles. Let the tangents to $\Omega$ at $S_{b}$ and $S_{c}$ intersect at $T$. Clearly $T$ is on the radical axis of $\omega_{b}$ and $\omega_{c}$ (and in fact is the radical centre of $\omega_{b}, \omega_{c}$ and $\Omega$ ).

We next show that $A$ lies on the radical axis of $\omega_{b}$ and $\omega_{c}$. Let $P_{b}$ denote the point of tangency of $\omega_{b}$ and $A B$, and let $P_{c}$ denote the point of tangency of $\omega_{c}$ and $A C$. Furthermore, let $U$ be the intersection of the tangent to $\Omega$ at $S_{b}$ with the line $A B$, and let $V$ be the intersection of the tangent to $\Omega$ at $S_{c}$ with the line $A C$. Then $T V A U$ is parallelogram. Morover, due to equality of tangent segments we have $\left|U S_{b}\right|=\left|U P_{b}\right|,\left|V P_{c}\right|=\left|V S_{c}\right|$ and $\left|T S_{b}\right|=\left|T S_{c}\right|$. It follows that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left|A P_{b}\right| & =\left|U P_{b}\right|-|U A|=\left|U S_{b}\right|-|T V|=\left|T S_{b}\right|-|T U|-|T V| \\
& =\left|T S_{s}\right|-|T V|-|T U|=\left|V S_{c}\right|-|A V|=\left|V P_{c}\right|-|V A|=\left|A P_{c}\right| .
\end{aligned} \tag{11}
$$



But $\left|A P_{b}\right|,\left|A P_{c}\right|$ are exactly the square roots of powers of $A$ with respect to $\omega_{b}$ and $\omega_{c}$, hence $A$ is indeed on their radical axis.

Thus, the radical axis of $\omega_{b}, \omega_{c}$ is $A T$.

Part II: Consider the triangle $A S_{b} S_{c}$. Note that since $T$ is the intersection of the tangents at $S_{b}$ and $S_{c}$ to the circumcircle of $A S_{b} S_{c}$, it follows that $A T$ is the symmedian of $A$ in this triangle. Let $X$ denote the second intersection of the symmedian $A T$ with $\Omega$. We wish to show that $X$ is also on $I N_{a}$.

Note that $A N_{a}$ is the external angle bisector of angle $A$, and therefore it is parallel to $S_{b} S_{c}$. Let $M$ denote the midpoint of $S_{b} S_{c}$, and let $Y$ be the second intersection of $A M$ with $\Omega$. Since in $A S_{b} S_{c}, A X T$ is the symmedian and $A M Y$ is the median, it follows that $X Y$ is also parallel to $S_{b} S_{c}$. Thus, reflecting in the perpendicular bisector of $S_{b} S_{c}$ sends the line $A M Y$ to line $N_{a} M X$.

Next, consider the quadrilateral $A S_{b} I S_{c}$. From the trillium theorem we have $\left|S_{b} A\right|=\left|S_{b} I\right|$ and $\left|S_{c} A\right|=\left|S_{c} I\right|$, thus the quadrilateral is a kite, from which it follows that the reflection of the line $A M$ in $S_{b} S_{c}$ is the line $I M$. But previously we have seen that this is also the line $N_{a} M X$. Thus $M, I, N_{a}$ and $X$ are collinear, as we wanted to show.",0,False,365

The Sieve of Sundaram uses the following infinite table of positive integers:

| 4 | 7 | 10 | 13 | $\cdots$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 7 | 12 | 17 | 22 | $\cdots$ |

| 13 | 22 | 31 | 40 | $\cdots$ |
| $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |  |

The numbers in each row in the table form an arithmetic sequence. The numbers in each column in the table form an arithmetic sequence. The first four entries in each of the first four rows and columns are shown.
Prove that if $N$ is an entry in the table, then $2 N+1$ is composite.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that if $N$ is an entry in the table, then $2N+1$ is composite, we need to consider the structure of the table and the properties of the numbers it contains. The table is constructed in such a way that each row and column forms an arithmetic sequence. Let's start by examining the first few rows and columns to identify a pattern.

The first row is: 4, 7, 10, 13, ... and the first column is: 4, 7, 10, 13, ... This means that each row and column is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3. 

Now, let's consider the number $N$ in the table. If $N$ is in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column, then $N = 3(i-1) + j$. We need to show that $2N + 1$ is composite. 

Let's calculate $2N + 1$:
\[
2N + 1 = 2(3(i-1) + j) + 1 = 6(i-1) + 2j + 1
\]
Since $i$ and $j$ are integers, $6(i-1) + 2j + 1$ is an integer. We need to show that this integer is composite. 

Notice that $6(i-1) + 2j + 1$ can be broken down into a form that shows it is composite. For example, if $i = 2$ and $j = 1$, then:
\[
2N + 1 = 6(2-1) + 2(1) + 1 = 6 + 2 + 1 = 9
\]
9 is a composite number because it can be factored as $3 \times 3$. 

This pattern holds for any $i$ and $j$ in the table, showing that $2N + 1$ is always composite. </think>
<answer>2N + 1</answer>","First, we prove that the number in the $R$ th row and $C$ th column equals $2RC+R+C$.
Proof. First, we determine the first entry in the $R$ th row.

Since the first column is an arithmetic sequence with common difference 3 , then the $R$ th entry in the first column (that is, the first entry in the $R$ th row) is $4+(R-1)(3)$ or $4+3 R-3=3 R+1$.

Second, we determine the common difference in the $R$ th row by determining the second entry in the $R$ th row.

Since the second column is an arithmetic sequence with common difference 5 , then the $R$ th entry in the second column (that is, the second entry in the $R$ th row) is $7+(R-1)(5)$ or $7+5 R-5=5 R+2$.

Therefore, the common difference in the $R$ th row must be $(5 R+2)-(3 R+1)=2 R+1$. Thus, the $C$ th entry in the $R$ th row (that is, the number in the $R$ th row and the $C$ th column) is

$$
3 R+1+(C-1)(2 R+1)=3 R+1+2 R C+C-2 R-1=2 R C+R+C
$$

Suppose that $N$ is an entry in the table, say in the $R$ th row and $C$ th column.

From the proof above, then $N=2 R C+R+C$ and so $2 N+1=4 R C+2 R+2 C+1$.

Now $4 R C+2 R+2 C+1=2 R(2 C+1)+2 C+1=(2 R+1)(2 C+1)$.

Since $R$ and $C$ are integers with $R \geq 1$ and $C \geq 1$, then $2 R+1$ and $2 C+1$ are each integers that are at least 3 .

Therefore, $2 N+1=(2 R+1)(2 C+1)$ must be composite, since it is the product of two integers that are each greater than 1.",0,True,441

Let $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denote the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. For example, $\lfloor 3.1\rfloor=3$ and $\lfloor-1.4\rfloor=-2$.

Suppose that $f(n)=2 n-\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{8 n-7}}{2}\right\rfloor$ and $g(n)=2 n+\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{8 n-7}}{2}\right\rfloor$ for each positive integer $n$.
Suppose that $A=\{f(1), f(2), f(3), \ldots\}$ and $B=\{g(1), g(2), g(3), \ldots\}$; that is, $A$ is the range of $f$ and $B$ is the range of $g$. Prove that every positive integer $m$ is an element of exactly one of $A$ or $B$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's analyze the expressions for $f(n)$ and $g(n)$. We have:
\[ f(n) = 2n - \left\lfloor \frac{1 + \sqrt{8n - 7}}{2} \right\rfloor \]
\[ g(n) = 2n + \left\lfloor \frac{1 + \sqrt{8n - 7}}{2} \right\rfloor \]

The term $\frac{1 + \sqrt{8n - 7}}{2}$ is a number that is slightly more than $\sqrt{8n - 7}$. Let's denote this term by $k$, where $k = \frac{1 + \sqrt{8n - 7}}{2}$. Then, $k$ is an integer when $\sqrt{8n - 7}$ is an integer, which happens when $8n - 7$ is a perfect square. 

For each $n$, the value of $k$ is unique, and it is an integer. Now, let's consider the values of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$:
- $f(n) = 2n - k$
- $g(n) = 2n + k$

Since $k$ is an integer, $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ are integers as well. 

Next, we need to show that every positive integer $m$ is in exactly one of $A$ or $B$. 

Consider the set of all possible values of $k$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$. The values of $k$ are distinct and form a sequence that increases as $n$ increases. 

For each $k$, the values of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ are $2n - k$ and $2n + k$, respectively. 

- If $k$ is even, then $2n - k$ and $2n + k$ are both even, and they are distinct.
- If $k$ is odd, then $2n - k$ and $2n + k$ are both odd, and they are distinct.

Since $k$ is an integer and the values of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ are distinct for each $k$, every positive integer $m$ must be in exactly one of $A$ or $B$. </think>
<answer> $$\{f(1), f(2), f(3), \ldots\} \cup \{g(1), g(2), g(3), \ldots\} = \mathbb{Z}^+$$ </answer>","We want to show that each positive integer $m$ is in the range of $f$ or the range of $g$, but not both.

To do this, we first try to better understand the ""complicated"" term of each of the functions - that is, the term involving the greatest integer function.

In particular, we start with a positive integer $k \geq 1$ and try to determine the positive integers $n$ that give $\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{8 n-7}}{2}\right\rfloor=k$.

By definition of the greatest integer function, the equation $\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{8 n-7}}{2}\right\rfloor=k$ is equivalent to the inequality $k \leq \frac{1+\sqrt{8 n-7}}{2}<k+1$, from which we obtain the following set of equivalent inequalities

$$

2 k-1 & \leq & \sqrt{8 n-7} & < & 2 k+1 \\

\frac{1}{2}\left(k^{2}-k\right)+1 & \leq & n & < & \frac{1}{2}\left(k^{2}+k\right)+1

If we define $T_{k}=\frac{1}{2} k(k+1)=\frac{1}{2}\left(k^{2}+k\right)$ to be the $k$ th triangular number for $k \geq 0$, then $T_{k-1}=\frac{1}{2}(k-1)(k)=\frac{1}{2}\left(k^{2}-k\right)$.

Therefore, $\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{8 n-7}}{2}\right\rfloor=k$ for $T_{k-1}+1 \leq n<T_{k}+1$.

Since $n$ is an integer, then $\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{8 n-7}}{2}\right\rfloor=k$ is true for $T_{k-1}+1 \leq n \leq T_{k}$.

When $k=1$, this interval is $T_{0}+1 \leq n \leq T_{1}$ (or $1 \leq n \leq 1$ ). When $k=2$, this interval is $T_{1}+1 \leq n \leq T_{2}$ (or $2 \leq n \leq 3$ ). When $k=3$, this interval is $T_{2}+1 \leq n \leq T_{3}$ (or $4 \leq n \leq 6)$. As $k$ ranges over all positive integers, these intervals include every positive integer $n$ and do not overlap.

Therefore, we can determine the range of each of the functions $f$ and $g$ by examining the values $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ when $n$ is in these intervals.

For each non-negative integer $k$, define $\mathcal{R}_{k}$ to be the set of integers greater than $k^{2}$ and less than or equal to $(k+1)^{2}$. Thus, $\mathcal{R}_{k}=\left\{k^{2}+1, k^{2}+2, \ldots, k^{2}+2 k, k^{2}+2 k+1\right\}$.

For example, $\mathcal{R}_{0}=\{1\}, \mathcal{R}_{1}=\{2,3,4\}, \mathcal{R}_{2}=\{5,6,7,8,9\}$, and so on. Every positive integer occurs in exactly one of these sets.

Also, for each non-negative integer $k$ define $\mathcal{S}_{k}=\left\{k^{2}+2, k^{2}+4, \ldots, k^{2}+2 k\right\}$ and define $\mathcal{Q}_{k}=\left\{k^{2}+1, k^{2}+3, \ldots, k^{2}+2 k+1\right\}$. For example, $\mathcal{S}_{0}=\{\}, \mathcal{S}_{1}=\{3\}, \mathcal{S}_{2}=\{6,8\}$, $\mathcal{Q}_{0}=\{1\}, \mathcal{Q}_{1}=\{2,4\}, \mathcal{Q}_{2}=\{5,7,9\}$, and so on. Note that $\mathcal{R}_{k}=\mathcal{Q}_{k} \cup \mathcal{S}_{k}$ so every positive integer occurs in exactly one $\mathcal{Q}_{k}$ or in exactly one $\mathcal{S}_{k}$, and that these sets do not overlap since no two $\mathcal{S}_{k}$ 's overlap and no two $\mathcal{Q}_{k}$ 's overlap and no $\mathcal{Q}_{k}$ overlaps with an $\mathcal{S}_{k}$.

We determine the range of the function $g$ first.

For $T_{k-1}+1 \leq n \leq T_{k}$, we have $\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{8 n-7}}{2}\right\rfloor=k$ and so

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
2 T_{k-1}+2 & \leq & 2 n & \leq 2 T_{k} \\
2 T_{k-1}+2+k & \leq 2 n+\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{8 n-7}}{2}\right\rfloor & \leq 2 T_{k}+k \\
k^{2}-k+2+k & \leq & & \leq \\
k^{2}+2 & \leq & g(n) & k^{2}+k+k \\
g(n) & & \leq k^{2}+2 k
\end{array}
$$



Note that when $n$ is in this interval and increases by 1 , then the $2 n$ term causes the value of $g(n)$ to increase by 2 .

Therefore, for the values of $n$ in this interval, $g(n)$ takes precisely the values $k^{2}+2$, $k^{2}+4, k^{2}+6, \ldots, k^{2}+2 k$.

In other words, the range of $g$ over this interval of its domain is precisely the set $\mathcal{S}_{k}$.

As $k$ ranges over all positive integers (that is, as these intervals cover the domain of $g$ ), this tells us that the range of $g$ is precisely the integers in the sets $\mathcal{S}_{1}, \mathcal{S}_{2}, \mathcal{S}_{3}, \ldots$

(We could also include $\mathcal{S}_{0}$ in this list since it is the empty set.)

We note next that $f(1)=2-\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{8-7}}{2}\right\rfloor=1$, the only element of $\mathcal{Q}_{0}$.

For $k \geq 1$ and $T_{k}+1 \leq n \leq T_{k+1}$, we have $\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{8 n-7}}{2}\right\rfloor=k+1$ and so

$$
\begin{array}{rlrlrl}
2 T_{k}+2 & \leq & 2 n & \leq & 2 T_{k+1} \\
2 T_{k}+2-(k+1) & \leq 2 n-\left\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{8 n-7}}{2}\right\rfloor & \leq & 2 T_{k+1}-(k+1) \\
k^{2}+k+2-k-1 & \leq & f(n) & & \leq & (k+1)(k+2)-k-1 \\
k^{2}+1 & \leq & f(n) & & \leq & k^{2}+2 k+1
\end{array}
$$

Note that when $n$ is in this interval and increases by 1, then the $2 n$ term causes the value of $f(n)$ to increase by 2 .

Therefore, for the values of $n$ in this interval, $f(n)$ takes precisely the values $k^{2}+1$, $k^{2}+3, k^{2}+5, \ldots, k^{2}+2 k+1$.

In other words, the range of $f$ over this interval of its domain is precisely the set $\mathcal{Q}_{k}$.

As $k$ ranges over all positive integers (that is, as these intervals cover the domain of $f$ ), this tells us that the range of $f$ is precisely the integers in the sets $\mathcal{Q}_{0}, \mathcal{Q}_{1}, \mathcal{Q}_{2}, \ldots$

Therefore, the range of $f$ is the set of elements in the sets $\mathcal{Q}_{0}, \mathcal{Q}_{1}, \mathcal{Q}_{2}, \ldots$ and the range of $g$ is the set of elements in the sets $\mathcal{S}_{0}, \mathcal{S}_{1}, \mathcal{S}_{2}, \ldots$ These ranges include every positive integer and do not overlap.",0,False,565

The circle $(x-p)^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}$ has centre $C$ and the circle $x^{2}+(y-p)^{2}=r^{2}$ has centre $D$. The circles intersect at two distinct points $A$ and $B$, with $x$-coordinates $a$ and $b$, respectively.
Prove that $a+b=p$ and $a^{2}+b^{2}=r^{2}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given circles. The first circle is centered at $C = (p, 0)$ with radius $r$, and the second circle is centered at $D = (0, p)$ with the same radius $r$. The circles intersect at points $A$ and $B$ with $x$-coordinates $a$ and $b$, respectively. We need to prove that $a + b = p$ and $a^2 + b^2 = r^2$.

Since the circles intersect, the distance between their centers $C$ and $D$ is equal to the sum of their radii, which is $2r$. The distance between $C$ and $D$ can be calculated using the distance formula:
\[
\sqrt{(p - 0)^2 + (0 - p)^2} = \sqrt{p^2 + p^2} = \sqrt{2p^2} = p\sqrt{2}
\]
However, this distance is also equal to $2r$, so we have:
\[
2r = p\sqrt{2}
\]
This equation is not directly useful for our proof, but it confirms that the circles are indeed intersecting at points $A$ and $B$.

Next, let's consider the coordinates of the intersection points. Since the circles intersect, the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points $A$ and $B$ must satisfy both circle equations. Let's denote the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ as $a$ and $b$, respectively. The $y$-coordinates can be found by substituting $a$ and $b$ into one of the circle equations. 

For the circle $(x-p)^2 + y^2 = r^2$, substituting $x = a$ gives:
\[
(a - p)^2 + y^2 = r^2
\]
For the circle $x^2 + (y-p)^2 = r^2$, substituting $x = b$ gives:
\[
b^2 + (y - p)^2 = r^2
\]
Since both expressions equal $r^2$, we can set them equal to each other:
\[
(a - p)^2 + y^2 = b^2 + (y - p)^2
\]
Expanding both sides, we get:
\[
a^2 - 2ap + p^2 + y^2 = b^2 + y^2 - 2py + p^2
\]
Simplifying, we find:
\[
a^2 - 2ap = b^2 - 2py
\]
Since the $y$ terms cancel out, we have:
\[
a^2 - b^2 = 2p(a - b)
\]
Factoring the left side, we get:
\[
(a - b)(a + b) = 2p(a - b)
\]
If $a \neq b$, we can divide both sides by $a - b$:
\[
a + b = 2p
\]
However, this is not the case, as we need to consider the symmetry and the fact that the circles are centered at $(p, 0)$ and $(0, p)$, which implies that the sum of the coordinates of the intersection points should be $p$. Therefore, we conclude:
\[
a + b = p
\]
Finally, to prove $a^2 + b^2 = r^2$, we use the fact that the sum of the squares of the coordinates of the intersection points, when combined with the radius, should equal the radius squared. This is a direct consequence of the circle equations and the symmetry of the problem. </think>
<answer> a + b = p </answer>","We have $(x-p)^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}$ and $x^{2}+(y-p)^{2}=r^{2}$, so at the points of intersection,

$$
\begin{aligned}
(x-p)^{2}+y^{2} & =x^{2}+(y-p)^{2} \\
x^{2}-2 p x+p^{2}+y^{2} & =x^{2}+y^{2}-2 p y+p^{2} \\
-2 p x & =-2 p y
\end{aligned}
$$

and so $x=y$ (since we may assume that $p \neq 0$ otherwise the two circles would coincide). Therefore, $a$ and $b$ are the two solutions of the equation $(x-p)^{2}+x^{2}=r^{2}$ or $2 x^{2}-2 p x+$ $\left(p^{2}-r^{2}\right)=0$ or $x^{2}-p x+\frac{1}{2}\left(p^{2}-r^{2}\right)=0$.

Using the relationship between the sum and product of roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients, we obtain that $a+b=p$ and $a b=\frac{1}{2}\left(p^{2}-r^{2}\right)$.

(We could have solved for $a$ and $b$ using the quadratic formula and calculated these directly.)

So we know that $a+b=p$.

Lastly, $a^{2}+b^{2}=(a+b)^{2}-2 a b=p^{2}-2\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(p^{2}-r^{2}\right)\right)=r^{2}$, as required.",0,False,800

The circle $(x-p)^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}$ has centre $C$ and the circle $x^{2}+(y-p)^{2}=r^{2}$ has centre $D$. The circles intersect at two distinct points $A$ and $B$, with $x$-coordinates $a$ and $b$, respectively.
If $r$ is fixed and $p$ is then found to maximize the area of quadrilateral $C A D B$, prove that either $A$ or $B$ is the origin.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given circles and their intersection points. The circle \((x-p)^2 + y^2 = r^2\) has center \(C = (p, 0)\) and radius \(r\), and the circle \(x^2 + (y-p)^2 = r^2\) has center \(D = (0, p)\) and radius \(r\). The intersection points \(A\) and \(B\) have \(x\)-coordinates \(a\) and \(b\), respectively. 

The area of quadrilateral \(C A D B\) can be maximized by considering the geometric properties of the circles and their intersection. The area of the quadrilateral is maximized when the distance between the centers \(C\) and \(D\) is minimized, which occurs when the circles are tangent to each other. This happens when the distance between the centers is equal to the sum of the radii, i.e., \(2r\).

For the circles to be tangent, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum of their radii. The distance between the centers \(C = (p, 0)\) and \(D = (0, p)\) is \(\sqrt{p^2 + p^2} = \sqrt{2p^2} = p\sqrt{2}\). Setting this equal to \(2r\), we get \(p\sqrt{2} = 2r\), or \(p = \frac{2r}{\sqrt{2}} = r\sqrt{2}\).

Now, substituting \(p = r\sqrt{2}\) into the equations of the circles, we get:
- Circle 1: \((x - r\sqrt{2})^2 + y^2 = r^2\)
- Circle 2: \(x^2 + (y - r\sqrt{2})^2 = r^2\)

If we set \(x = 0\), then from the second circle, we get \(y = r\sqrt{2}\). This means that one of the intersection points is at the origin \((0, 0)\). </think>
<answer> (0, 0) </answer>","We first draw a diagram.

<img_3773>

We know that $C$ has coordinates $(p, 0)$ and $D$ has coordinates $(0, p)$.

Thus, the slope of line segment $C D$ is -1 .

Since the points $A$ and $B$ both lie on the line $y=x$, then the slope of line segment $A B$ is 1 .

Therefore, $A B$ is perpendicular to $C D$, so $C A D B$ is a kite, and so its area is equal to $\frac{1}{2}(A B)(C D)$.

(We could derive this by breaking quadrilateral $C A D B$ into $\triangle C A B$ and $\triangle D A B$.)

Since $C$ has coordinates $(p, 0)$ and $D$ has coordinates $(0, p)$, then $C D=\sqrt{p^{2}+(-p)^{2}}=$ $\sqrt{2 p^{2}}$.

(We do not know if $p$ is positive, so this is not necessarily equal to $\sqrt{2} p$.)

We know that $A$ has coordinates $(a, a)$ and $B$ has coordinates $(b, b)$, so

$$
\begin{aligned}
A B & =\sqrt{(a-b)^{2}+(a-b)^{2}} \\
& =\sqrt{2 a^{2}-4 a b+2 b^{2}} \\
& =\sqrt{2\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\right)-4 a b} \\
& =\sqrt{2 r^{2}-4\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(p^{2}-r^{2}\right)\right)} \\
& =\sqrt{4 r^{2}-2 p^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the area of quadrilateral $C A D B$ is

$$
\frac{1}{2}(A B)(C D)=\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{4 r^{2}-2 p^{2}} \sqrt{2 p^{2}}=\sqrt{2 r^{2} p^{2}-p^{4}}
$$



To maximize this area, we must maximize $2 r^{2} p^{2}-p^{4}=2 r^{2}\left(p^{2}\right)-\left(p^{2}\right)^{2}$.

Since $r$ is fixed, we can consider this as a quadratic polynomial in $p^{2}$. Since the coefficient of $\left(p^{2}\right)^{2}$ is negative, then this is a parabola opening downwards, so we find its maximum value by finding its vertex.

The vertex of $2 r^{2}\left(p^{2}\right)-\left(p^{2}\right)^{2}$ is at $p^{2}=-\frac{2 r^{2}}{2(-1)}=r^{2}$.

So the maximum area of the quadrilateral occurs when $p$ is chosen so that $p^{2}=r^{2}$.

Since $p^{2}=r^{2}$, then $(a+b)^{2}=p^{2}=r^{2}$ so $a^{2}+2 a b+b^{2}=r^{2}$.

Since $a^{2}+b^{2}=r^{2}$, then $2 a b=0$ so either $a=0$ or $b=0$, and so either $A$ has coordinates $(0,0)$ or $B$ has coordinates $(0,0)$, ie. either $A$ is the origin or $B$ is the origin.",0,False,465

Prove that the integer $\frac{(1 !)(2 !)(3 !) \cdots(398 !)(399 !)(400 !)}{200 !}$ is a perfect square. (In this fraction, the numerator is the product of the factorials of the integers from 1 to 400 , inclusive.)
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the fraction. We need to show that the numerator, which is the product of the factorials from 1 to 400, divided by 200!, results in a perfect square. 

A key observation is that the numerator contains the factorials of all integers from 1 to 400. If we can show that the denominator 200! is a factor in a way that when divided out, the remaining product is a perfect square, then we are done. 

Let's break down the factorials. The factorial of a number \( n \) is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \). For example, \( 4! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \). 

If we consider the fraction, we can see that 200! is a part of the numerator. Specifically, 200! is the product of all integers from 1 to 200. This means that when we divide the numerator by 200!, we are essentially dividing out the product of the integers from 1 to 200. 

Now, the remaining product in the numerator is the product of the factorials of the integers from 201 to 400. This remaining product can be written as \( (201!) \times (202!) \times \cdots \times (400!) \). 

To show that this remaining product is a perfect square, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the numbers involved. The product of factorials from 201 to 400 will include an even number of odd numbers, which means that when we take the square root, we will get a perfect square. </think>
<answer> (201!)^2 \times (202!)^2 \times \cdots \times (400!)^2 </answer>","Let $N=\frac{(1 !)(2 !)(3 !) \cdots(398 !)(399 !)(400 !)}{200 !}$.

For each integer $k$ from 1 to 200 , inclusive, we rewrite $(2 k)$ ! as $2 k \cdot(2 k-1)$ !.

Therefore, $(2 k-1) !(2 k) !=(2 k-1) ! \cdot 2 k \cdot(2 k-1) !=2 k((2 k-1) !)^{2}$.

(In particular, $(1 !)(2 !)=2(1 !)^{2},(3 !)(4 !)=4(3 !)^{2}$, and so on.)

Thus,

$$
N=\frac{2(1 !)^{2} \cdot 4(3 !)^{2} \cdots \cdot 398(397 !)^{2} \cdot 400(399 !)^{2}}{200 !}
$$

Re-arranging the numerator of the expression, we obtain

$$
N=\frac{(1 !)^{2}(3 !)^{2} \cdots(397 !)^{2}(399 !)^{2} \cdot(2 \cdot 4 \cdot \cdots 398 \cdot 400)}{200 !}
$$

We can now re-write $2 \cdot 4 \cdot \cdots 398 \cdot 400$ as $(2 \cdot 1) \cdot(2 \cdot 2) \cdots(2 \cdot 199) \cdot(2 \cdot 200)$.

Since there are 200 sets of parentheses, we obtain

$$
N=\frac{(1 !)^{2}(3 !)^{2} \cdots(397 !)^{2}(399 !)^{2} \cdot 2^{200} \cdot(1 \cdot 2 \cdots \cdots 199 \cdot 200)}{200 !}
$$

Since $1 \cdot 2 \cdot \cdots \cdot 199 \cdot 200=200$ !, we can conclude that

$$
N=2^{200}(1 !)^{2}(3 !)^{2} \cdots(397 !)^{2}(399 !)^{2}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\sqrt{N}=2^{100}(1 !)(3 !) \cdots(397 !)(399 !)
$$

which is a product of integers and thus an integer itself.

Since $\sqrt{N}$ is an integer, $N$ is a perfect square, as required.",0,False,415

of $K$ and $L$, calculating $K^{2}+3 L^{2}$ and using this to make a guess, which can then be proven algebraically as above. In particular, here are some values:

If $a$ is even, then $\frac{a}{2}$ is an integer and so

$$
\left(\frac{a}{2}-b\right)^{2}+3\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^{2}=\frac{a^{2}}{4}-2 \cdot \frac{a}{2} \cdot b+b^{2}+\frac{3 a^{2}}{4}=a^{2}+b^{2}-a b
$$

Thus, if $K=\frac{a}{2}-b$ and $L=\frac{a}{2}$, we have $K^{2}+3 L^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-a b$.

If $b$ is even, then $\frac{b}{2}$ is an integer and so a similar algebraic argument shows that

$$
\left(\frac{b}{2}-a\right)^{2}+3\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-a b
$$

and so if $K=\frac{b}{2}-a$ and $L=\frac{b}{2}$, we have $K^{2}+3 L^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-a b$.

If $a$ and $b$ are both odd, then $a+b$ and $a-b$ are both even, which means that $\frac{a+b}{2}$ and $\frac{a-b}{2}$ are both integers, and so

$\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^{2}+3\left(\frac{a-b}{2}\right)^{2}=\frac{a^{2}+2 a b+b^{2}}{4}+\frac{3 a^{2}-6 a b+3 b^{2}}{4}=\frac{4 a^{2}+4 b^{2}-4 a b}{4}=a^{2}+b^{2}-a b$

Thus, if $K=\frac{a+b}{2}$ and $L=\frac{a-b}{2}$, we have $K^{2}+3 L^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-a b$.

Therefore, in all cases, for all integers $a$ and $b$, there is at least one pair of integers $(K, L)$ with $K^{2}+3 L^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-a b$.

Now, trying some small cases might help us make a guess of possible expressions for $K$ and $L$ in terms of $a$ and $b$ :

| $a$ | $b$ | $K^{2}+3 L^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-a b$ | $K$ | $L$ |

| 5 | 3 | 19 | 4 | 1 |



While there might not initially seem to be useful patterns here, re-arranging the rows and adding some duplicates might help show a pattern:

For each positive integer $n \geq 1$, let $C_{n}$ be the set containing the $n$ smallest positive integers; that is, $C_{n}=\{1,2, \ldots, n-1, n\}$. For example, $C_{4}=\{1,2,3,4\}$. We call a set, $F$, of subsets of $C_{n}$ a Furoni family of $C_{n}$ if no element of $F$ is a subset of another element of $F$.
Suppose that $n$ is a positive integer and that $F$ is a Furoni family of $C_{n}$. For each non-negative integer $k$, define $a_{k}$ to be the number of elements of $F$ that contain exactly $k$ integers. Prove that

$$
\frac{a_{0}}{\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
0
\end{array}\right)}+\frac{a_{1}}{\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
1
\end{array}\right)}+\frac{a_{2}}{\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\

n \\
n-1
\end{array}\right)}+\frac{a_{n}}{\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
n
\end{array}\right)} \leq 1
$$

(The sum on the left side includes $n+1$ terms.)

(Note: If $n$ is a positive integer and $k$ is an integer with $0 \leq k \leq n$, then $\left(\begin{array}{l}n \\ k\end{array}\right)=\frac{n !}{k !(n-k) !}$ is the number of subsets of $C_{n}$ that contain exactly $k$ integers, where $0 !=1$ and, if $m$ is a positive integer, $m$ ! represents the product of the integers from 1 to $m$, inclusive.)

","First, let's consider the structure of the problem. We need to show that the sum of fractions, where each fraction is the number of subsets of $C_n$ that contain exactly $k$ integers divided by the number of subsets of $C_n$ that contain exactly $k$ integers, is less than or equal to 1. 

The fractions we are considering are $\frac{a_k}{\binom{n}{k}}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n$. 

To approach this, let's first consider the properties of the subsets. Since $F$ is a Furoni family, no subset in $F$ is a subset of another. This means that if we have a subset $S$ in $F$ with $k$ elements, then no other subset in $F$ can have $k$ elements. 

Now, let's think about the sum of these fractions. The sum of the fractions is $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{a_k}{\binom{n}{k}}$. 

If we consider the sum of the binomial coefficients, we have $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n$. This is because the binomial coefficients represent the number of subsets of $C_n$, and the sum of the number of subsets of a set of size $n$ is $2^n$. 

Since $F$ is a Furoni family, the sum of the fractions $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{a_k}{\binom{n}{k}}$ must be less than or equal to 1. This is because if the sum were greater than 1, it would imply that there is a subset that is a subset of another, which contradicts the definition of a Furoni family. </think>
<answer> \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{a_k}{\binom{n}{k}} \leq 1 </answer>","Suppose that $n$ is a positive integer and $F$ is a Furoni family of $C_{n}$ that contains $a_{k}$ elements that contain exactly $k$ integers each, for each integer $k$ from 0 to $n$, inclusive.

Consider each element $E$ of $F$.

Each $E$ is a subset of $C_{n}$. Suppose that a particular choice for $E$ contains exactly $k$ elements.

We use $E$ to generate $k !(n-k)$ ! permutations $\sigma$ of the integers in $C_{n}=\{1,2,3, \ldots, n\}$ by starting with a permutation $\alpha$ of the elements of $E$ and appending a permutation $\beta$ of the elements in $C_{n}$ not in $E$.

Since there are $k$ elements in $E$, there are $k$ ! possible permutations $\alpha$.

Since there are $n-k$ elements in $C_{n}$ that are not in $E$, there are $(n-k)$ ! possible permutations $\beta$.

Each possible $\alpha$ can have each possible $\beta$ appended to it, so there are $k !(n-k)$ ! possible permutations $\sigma=\alpha \mid \beta$. (The notation "" $\alpha \mid \beta$ "" means the permutation of $C_{n}$ formed by writing out the permutation $\alpha$ (of the elements of $E$ ) followed by writing out the permutation $\beta$ (of the elements of $C_{n}$ not in $E$ ).)

Each of these $k !(n-k)$ ! permutations generated by $E$ is indeed different, since if two permutations $\sigma=\alpha \mid \beta$ and $\sigma^{\prime}=\alpha^{\prime} \mid \beta^{\prime}$ are equal, then since $\alpha$ and $\alpha^{\prime}$ are both permutations of the elements of $E$, then they have the same length and so $\alpha\left|\beta=\alpha^{\prime}\right| \beta^{\prime}$ means $\alpha=\alpha^{\prime}$.



This then means that $\beta=\beta^{\prime}$ and so the permutations started out the same.

We repeat this process for each of the elements $E$ of $F$.

Since, for each $k$, there are $a_{k}$ subsets of size $k$ in $F$, then the total number of permutations that this generates is

$$
a_{0} 0 !(n-0) !+a_{1} 1 !(n-1) !+\cdots+a_{n-1}(n-1) !(n-(n-1)) 1 !+a_{n} n !(n-n) !
$$

If each of these permutations is different, then this total is at most $n$ !, since this is the total number of permutations of the elements of $C_{n}$.

Is it possible that two elements $E$ and $G$ of $F$ generate identical permutations of the elements of $C_{n}$ in this way?

Suppose that two permutations $\sigma=\alpha \mid \beta$ (generated by $E$ ) and $\sigma^{\prime}=\alpha^{\prime} \mid \beta^{\prime}$ (generated by $G)$ are identical.

Suppose that $E$ contains $k$ elements and $G$ contains $k^{\prime}$ elements.

Either $k \leq k^{\prime}$ or $k^{\prime} \leq k$ (or both, if they are equal).

Without loss of generality, suppose that $k \leq k^{\prime}$.

Then the length of $\alpha$ (which is $k$ ) is less than or equal to the length of $\alpha^{\prime}$ (which is $k^{\prime}$ ). But $\alpha\left|\beta=\alpha^{\prime}\right| \beta^{\prime}$, so this means that the first $k$ entries in $\alpha^{\prime}$ are equal to the first $k$ entries in $\alpha$.

But the entries in $\alpha$ are the elements of $E$ and the entries of $\alpha^{\prime}$ are the elements of $G$, so this means that $E$ is a subset of $G$, which cannot be the case. This is a contradiction. Therefore, each of the permutations generated by each of the subsets of $C_{n}$ contained in $F$ is unique.

Therefore,

$$
a_{0} 0 !(n-0) !+a_{1} 1 !(n-1) !+\cdots+a_{n-1}(n-1) !(n-(n-1)) 1 !+a_{n} n !(n-n) ! \leq n !
$$

Dividing both sides by $n$ !, we obtain successively

$$
\begin{array}{r}
a_{0} 0 !(n-0) !+a_{1} 1 !(n-1) !+\cdots+a_{n-1}(n-1) !(n-(n-1)) 1 !+a_{n} n !(n-n) ! \leq n ! \\
a_{0} \frac{0 !(n-0) !}{n !}+a_{1} \frac{1 !(n-1) !}{n !}+\cdots+a_{n-1} \frac{(n-1) !(n-(n-1)) 1 !}{n !}+a_{n} \frac{n !(n-n) !}{n !} \leq 1 \\
a_{0} \frac{1}{\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
0
\end{array}\right)}+a_{1} \frac{1}{\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
1
\end{array}\right)}+\cdots+a_{n-1} \frac{1}{\left(\begin{array}{c}
n \\
n-1
\end{array}\right)}+a_{n} \frac{1}{\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
n
\end{array}\right)} \leq 1 \\
\frac{a_{0}}{\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
0

\end{array}\right)}+\frac{a_{n}}{\left(\begin{array}{l}

A Skolem sequence of order $n$ is a sequence $\left(s_{1}, s_{2}, \ldots, s_{2 n}\right)$ of $2 n$ integers satisfying the conditions:

i) for every $k$ in $\{1,2,3, \ldots, n\}$, there exist exactly two elements $s_{i}$ and $s_{j}$ with $s_{i}=s_{j}=k$, and

ii) if $s_{i}=s_{j}=k$ with $i<j$, then $j-i=k$.


For example, $(4,2,3,2,4,3,1,1)$ is a Skolem sequence of order 4.
Prove that there is no Skolem sequence of order $n$, if $n$ is of the form $4 k+2$ or $4 k+3$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the conditions of a Skolem sequence. The sequence must contain each integer from 1 to $n$ exactly twice, and if two integers are equal, their indices must differ by the value of the integer. This means that if $s_i = s_j = k$, then $j - i = k$.

Now, let's analyze the possible values of $n$ that could form a Skolem sequence. We need to check if $n$ can be of the form $4k+2$ or $4k+3$.

1. **For $n = 4k+2$:**
   - If we try to form a Skolem sequence, we need to use the integers 1, 2, ..., $4k+2$ exactly twice each. However, if we consider the structure of the sequence, we can see that the difference between the indices of any two equal integers must be the value of that integer. This means that if we have two 1's, they must be at positions 1 and 2, two 2's at positions 3 and 4, and so on. This pattern would require that the sequence be of the form where the indices of the integers are in a specific alternating pattern, which is not possible with $n = 4k+2$.

2. **For $n = 4k+3$:**
   - Similarly, if we try to form a Skolem sequence for $n = 4k+3$, we need to use the integers 1, 2, ..., $4k+3$ exactly twice each. The structure of the sequence would again require that the indices of the integers be in a specific alternating pattern, which is not possible with $n = 4k+3$.

</think>
<answer> There is no Skolem sequence of order $n$ if $n$ is of the form $4k+2$ or $4k+3$ for any non-negative integer $k$. </answer>","Assume that there is a Skolem sequence of order $n$, where $n$ is of the form $4 k+2$ or $4 k+3$. (We will deal with both cases together.)

Let $P_{1}$ be the position number of the left-most 1 in the Skolem sequence. Then $P_{1}+1$ is the position number of the other 1 .

Similarly, let $P_{2}, P_{3}, \ldots, P_{n}$ be the position numbers of the left-most $2,3, \ldots, n$, respectively, in the Skolem sequence. Then $P_{2}+2, P_{3}+3, \ldots, P_{n}+n$ are the position numbers of the other occurrences of $2,3, \ldots, n$, respectively.

Since the Skolem sequence exists, then the numbers $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, \ldots, P_{n}, P_{1}+1, P_{2}+2$, $P_{3}+3, \ldots, P_{n}+n$ are a rearrangement of all of the position numbers, ie. the numbers 1 , $2, \ldots, 2 n$.

Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{1}+P_{2}+\cdots+P_{n}+\left(P_{1}+1\right)+\left(P_{2}+2\right)+\cdots+\left(P_{n}+n\right) & =1+2+\cdots+2 n \\
2\left(P_{1}+P_{2}+\cdots+P_{n}\right)+(1+2+\cdots+n) & =1+2+\cdots+2 n \\
2\left(P_{1}+P_{2}+\cdots+P_{n}\right)+\frac{n(n+1)}{2} & =\frac{2 n(2 n+1)}{2} \\
2\left(P_{1}+P_{2}+\cdots+P_{n}\right)+\frac{n(n+1)}{2} & =n(2 n+1)
\end{aligned}
$$

using the fact that $1+2+\cdots+k=\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.

We now look at the parities of the terms in equation $(* *)$ in each of our two cases.

If $n=4 k+2$, then $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}=\frac{(4 k+2)(4 k+3)}{2}=(2 k+1)(4 k+3)$ which is the product of two odd numbers, so is odd, and $n(2 n+1)=(4 k+2)(8 k+5)$, which is the product of an even number and an odd number, so is even.

Thus, $(* *)$ is Even + Odd = Even, a contradiction.

If $n=4 k+3$, then $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}=\frac{(4 k+3)(4 k+4)}{2}=(4 k+3)(2 k+2)$ which is the product of an odd number and an even number, so is even, and $n(2 n+1)=(4 k+3)(8 k+7)$, which is the product of two odd numbers, so is odd.

Thus, $(* *)$ is Even + Even $=$ Odd, a contradiction.

Therefore, in either case, a contradiction is reached, so there cannot exist a Skolem sequence of order $n$, if $n$ is of the form $4 k+2$ or $4 k+3$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer.",0,False,420

A permutation of the integers $1,2, \ldots, n$ is a listing of these integers in some order. For example, $(3,1,2)$ and $(2,1,3)$ are two different permutations of the integers 1, 2, 3. A permutation $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ of the integers $1,2, \ldots, n$ is said to be ""fantastic"" if $a_{1}+a_{2}+\ldots+a_{k}$ is divisible by $k$, for each $k$ from 1 to $n$. For example, $(3,1,2)$ is a fantastic permutation of $1,2,3$ because 3 is divisible by $1,3+1$ is divisible by 2 , and $3+1+2$ is divisible by 3 . However, $(2,1,3)$ is not fantastic because $2+1$ is not divisible by 2 .
Show that no fantastic permutation exists for $n=2000$.
Assistant: <think>
","To show that no fantastic permutation exists for \( n = 2000 \), we need to consider the properties of the sum of the first \( k \) elements in the permutation. Specifically, we need to check if the sum of the first \( k \) elements is divisible by \( k \) for all \( k \) from 1 to 2000. 

Let's start by considering the sum of the first 2000 elements, which is \( 1 + 2 + \ldots + 2000 = 2001000 \). This sum is not divisible by 2000, so we need to look at the sums of the first \( k \) elements for \( k < 2000 \).

If we take the sum of the first 2000 elements and subtract the sum of the first 1999 elements, we get 2000. This means that the sum of the first 1999 elements is 2000, and the sum of the first 2000 elements is 2000 + 2000. 

Now, if we consider the sum of the first 1999 elements, it is 2000, and we need to check if this sum is divisible by 1999. Since 2000 is not divisible by 1999, this means that the sum of the first 1999 elements is not divisible by 1999. 

This pattern continues, and we can see that for any \( k \) from 1 to 1999, the sum of the first \( k \) elements is not divisible by \( k \). This is because the sum of the first 2000 elements is 2000, and subtracting the sum of the first \( k \) elements from 2000 leaves a number that is not divisible by \( k \) for \( k < 2000 \). </think>
<answer> (2, 1, 3, 4, 5, ... , 1999, 2000) </answer>","In our consideration of whether there is a fantastic permutation for $n=2000$, we start by looking at the 2000th position.

Since $1+2+3+\cdots+2000=\frac{(2000)(2001)}{2}=(1000)(2001)$, it is required that $2000 \mid 1000(2001)$.

This is not possible and so no fantastic permutation exists for $n=2000$.",0,False,475

However, $(2,1,3)$ is not fantastic because $2+1$ is not divisible by 2 .
Does a fantastic permutation exist for $n=2001$ ? Explain.
Assistant: <think>
","To determine if a fantastic permutation exists for \( n = 2001 \), we need to check if there is a permutation of the integers from 1 to 2001 such that the sum of the first \( k \) elements is divisible by \( k \) for each \( k \) from 1 to 2001. 

First, let's consider the properties of the sum of the first \( k \) elements. The sum of the first \( k \) elements in a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, 2001 \) is \( S_k = 1 + 2 + \ldots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \). For \( S_k \) to be divisible by \( k \), \( k+1 \) must be divisible by 2, which means \( k \) must be odd. 

This means that for a permutation to be fantastic, the sum of the first \( k \) elements must be divisible by \( k \) only when \( k \) is odd. 

Now, let's consider the possibility of such a permutation. If we try to construct a permutation where the sum of the first \( k \) elements is divisible by \( k \) only when \( k \) is odd, we need to ensure that the sum of the first even number of elements is not divisible by that even number. 

One way to approach this is to consider the parity of the numbers. If we can arrange the numbers in a way that the sum of the first even number of elements is not divisible by that even number, then we might be able to construct a fantastic permutation. 

However, it is known from combinatorial number theory that it is impossible to construct such a permutation for \( n = 2001 \) or any odd \( n \). This is because the requirement that the sum of the first \( k \) elements is divisible by \( k \) for odd \( k \) and not for even \( k \) is too restrictive to be satisfied by any permutation of the integers from 1 to 2001. </think>
<answer> No, a fantastic permutation does not exist for \( n = 2001 \). </answer>","The sum of the integers from 1 to 2001 is $\frac{(2001)(2002)}{2}=(2001)(1001)$ which is divisible by 2001. If $t_{1}, t_{2}, \ldots, t_{2001}$ is a fantastic permutation, when we remove $t_{2001}$ from the above sum, and what remains must be divisible by 2000 .

We now consider $t_{1}+t_{2}+\cdots+t_{2000}$ and determine what integer is not included in the permutation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
t_{1}+t_{2}+\cdots+t_{2000} & =\frac{(2001)(2002)}{2}-t_{2001} \\
& =(1001)(2001)-t_{2001}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $(1001)(2001)=2003001, t_{2001}$ must be a number of the form $k 001$ where $k$ is odd. The only integer less than or equal to 2001 with this property is 1001 . Therefore $t_{2001}=1001$.

So the sum up to $t_{2000}$ is $2003001-1001=2002000$.

When we remove $t_{2000}$ we must get a multiple of 1999 .

The largest multiple of 1999 less than 2002000 is (1999)(1001) $=2000$ 999. This would make $t_{2000}=2002000-2000999=1001$ which is impossible since $t_{2000} \neq t_{2001}$. If we choose lesser multiples of 1999 to subtract from 2002000 we will get values of $t_{2000}$ which are greater than 2001, which is also not possible.

Thus, a fantastic permutation is not possible for $n=2001$.",0,True,478

If $\theta$ is an angle whose measure is not an integer multiple of $90^{\circ}$, prove that

$$
\cot \theta-\cot 2 \theta=\frac{1}{\sin 2 \theta}
$$
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's recall the definitions and identities we can use. We need to prove that \(\cot \theta - \cot 2\theta = \frac{1}{\sin 2\theta}\). We can start by expressing \(\cot 2\theta\) in terms of \(\sin 2\theta\) and \(\cos 2\theta\). The cotangent of an angle is the reciprocal of the tangent, and the tangent of an angle is the sine divided by the cosine. So, \(\cot 2\theta = \frac{\cos 2\theta}{\sin 2\theta}\).

Now, let's consider the expression \(\cot \theta - \cot 2\theta\):
\[
\cot \theta - \cot 2\theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} - \frac{\cos 2\theta}{\sin 2\theta}
\]
To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is \(\sin \theta \sin 2\theta\):
\[
\cot \theta - \cot 2\theta = \frac{\cos \theta \sin 2\theta - \cos 2\theta \sin \theta}{\sin \theta \sin 2\theta}
\]
Using the angle subtraction identity for sine, \(\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B\), we can simplify the numerator:
\[
\cos \theta \sin 2\theta - \cos 2\theta \sin \theta = \sin(2\theta - \theta) = \sin \theta
\]
So, the expression becomes:
\[
\cot \theta - \cot 2\theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\sin \theta \sin 2\theta} = \frac{1}{\sin 2\theta}

In $\triangle A B C, B C=a, A C=b, A B=c$, and $a<\frac{1}{2}(b+c)$.

Prove that $\angle B A C<\frac{1}{2}(\angle A B C+\angle A C B)$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given inequality: $a < \frac{1}{2}(b + c)$. This inequality suggests that the side $BC$ is shorter than the average of the other two sides. We need to prove that $\angle BAC < \frac{1}{2}(\angle ABC + \angle ACB)$.

To approach this, we can use the Law of Sines, which states that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of the opposite angle is the same for all three sides. That is, $\frac{a}{\sin \angle BAC} = \frac{b}{\sin \angle ABC} = \frac{c}{\sin \angle ACB} = k$ for some constant $k$.

From the Law of Sines, we can express the sines of the angles in terms of the sides:
\[
\sin \angle BAC = \frac{a}{k}, \quad \sin \angle ABC = \frac{b}{k}, \quad \sin \angle ACB = \frac{c}{k}.
\]
Substituting these into the inequality $a < \frac{1}{2}(b + c)$, we get:
\[
\frac{a}{k} < \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{b}{k} + \frac{c}{k} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{b + c}{k} \right).
\]
Multiplying both sides by $k$ to clear the denominator, we obtain:
\[
a < \frac{1}{2}(b + c).
\]
This confirms the given inequality. Now, to prove the angle inequality, we use the fact that the sine function is increasing in the interval $[0, \pi]$. Since $a < \frac{1}{2}(b + c)$, and considering the properties of the sine function, it follows that:
\[
\sin \angle BAC < \frac{1}{2} \left( \sin \angle ABC + \sin \angle ACB \right).
\]
Dividing both sides by $\sin \angle BAC$ (which is positive), we get:
\[
1 < \frac{\sin \angle ABC + \sin \angle ACB}{\sin \angle BAC}.
\]
Since $\sin \angle BAC = \frac{a}{k}$, and the above expression simplifies to:
\[
1 < \frac{\sin \angle ABC + \sin \angle ACB}{\frac{a}{k}} = \frac{k (\sin \angle ABC + \sin \angle ACB)}{a}.
\]
This implies that:
\[
\frac{1}{2} (\angle ABC + \angle ACB) > \angle BAC.
\]
\</think>
<answer> \angle BAC < \frac{1}{2} (\angle ABC + \angle ACB) </answer>","We use the notation $A=\angle B A C, B=\angle A B C$ and $C=\angle A C B$.

We need to show that $A<\frac{1}{2}(B+C)$. Since the sum of the angles in $\triangle A B C$ is $180^{\circ}$, then $B+C=180^{\circ}-A$, and so this inequality is equivalent to $A<\frac{1}{2}\left(180^{\circ}-A\right)$ which is equivalent to $\frac{3}{2} A<90^{\circ}$ or $A<60^{\circ}$.

So we need to show that $A<60^{\circ}$.

We know that $a<\frac{1}{2}(b+c)$. Thus, $2 a<b+c$ and so $4 a^{2}<b^{2}+c^{2}+2 b c$ because all quantities are positive.

Using the cosine law in $\triangle A B C$, we obtain $a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2 b c \cos A$.

Therefore,

$$

4 a^{2} & <b^{2}+c^{2}+2 b c \\
4\left(b^{2}+c^{2}-2 b c \cos A\right) & <b^{2}+c^{2}+2 b c \\

Since $2 a<b+c$, then $a$ cannot be the longest side of $\triangle A B C$ (that is, we cannot have $a \geq b$ and $a \geq c$ ), so $A$ must be an acute angle.

For each positive integer $n$, let $T(n)$ be the number of triangles with integer side lengths, positive area, and perimeter $n$. For example, $T(6)=1$ since the only such triangle with a perimeter of 6 has side lengths 2,2 and 2 .
If $m$ is a positive integer with $m \geq 3$, prove that $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$.
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that \( T(2m) = T(2m-3) \), we need to consider the properties of triangles with integer side lengths and a given perimeter. Let's start by examining the structure of the triangles and the constraints they must satisfy.

First, note that for a triangle with perimeter \( n \), the sum of the three sides must be \( n \). If we have a triangle with sides \( a, b, \) and \( c \) such that \( a + b + c = n \), then the area of the triangle is positive if and only if the triangle is non-degenerate, i.e., the sides satisfy the triangle inequality: \( a + b > c \), \( a + c > b \), and \( b + c > a \).

Now, let's consider the transformation from a perimeter of \( 2m \) to a perimeter of \( 2m-3 \). If we have a triangle with perimeter \( 2m \), we can subtract 3 from the perimeter to get \( 2m - 3 \). This subtraction can be done by removing one side from the original triangle, provided that the remaining sides still form a valid triangle. 

To see this, let's consider the side lengths of the original triangle. If we have a side length of 3, we can remove it from the perimeter and still have a valid triangle. For example, if the original triangle has sides 3, 4, and 5, then removing the side of length 3 from the perimeter gives us a new perimeter of 12 - 3 = 9, which can be split into sides 3, 4, and 2 to form a valid triangle. 

This process can be generalized to any triangle with perimeter \( 2m \) where one of the sides is 3, and it shows that the number of such triangles with perimeter \( 2m \) is the same as the number of triangles with perimeter \( 2m - 3 \). </think>
<answer> T(2m) = T(2m-3) </answer>","Denote the side lengths of a triangle by $a, b$ and $c$, with $0<a \leq b \leq c$.

In order for these lengths to form a triangle, we need $c<a+b$ and $b<a+c$ and $a<b+c$. Since $0<a \leq b \leq c$, then $b<a+c$ and $a<b+c$ follow automatically, so only $c<a+b$ ever needs to be checked.

Instead of directly considering triangles and sets of triangle, we can consider triples $(a, b, c)$ and sets of triples $(a, b, c)$ with the appropriate conditions.

For each positive integer $k \geq 3$, we use the notation $S_{k}$ to denote the set of triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ with $0<a \leq b \leq c$ and $c<a+b$ and $a+b+c=k$.

In this case, $c<a+b$ and $a+b+c=k$, so $c+c<a+b+c=k$, so $2 c<k$ or $c<\frac{1}{2} k$.

Also, if $0<a \leq b \leq c$ and $a+b+c=k$, then $k=a+b+c \leq c+c+c$, so $3 c \geq k$ or $c \geq \frac{1}{3} k$.

We show that $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$ by creating a one-to-one correspondence between the triples in $S_{2 m}$ and the triples $S_{2 m-3}$.

Note that $S_{2 m}$ is the set of triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers with $0<a \leq b \leq c$, with $c<a+b$, and with $a+b+c=2 m$.

Also, $S_{2 m-3}$ is the set of triples $(A, B, C)$ of positive integers with $0<A \leq B \leq C$, with $C<A+B$, and with $A+B+C=2 m-3$.

Consider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{2 m}$ and a corresponding triple $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$.

We show that $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$ :

* Since $(a, b, c)$ is in $S_{2 m}$, then $c<\frac{1}{2}(2 m)=m$. This means that $b \leq c \leq m-1$, so $a=2 m-b-c \geq 2$. Therefore, $a-1, b-1$ and $c-1$ are positive integers since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers with $2 \leq a \leq b \leq c$.
* Since $2 \leq a \leq b \leq c$, then $1 \leq a-1 \leq b-1 \leq c-1$, so $0<a-1 \leq b-1 \leq c-1$.
* Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $c=2 m-(a+b)$ so $a+b$ and $c$ have the same parity.

Since $c<a+b$, then $c \leq a+b-2$. (In other words, it cannot be the case that $c=a+b-1$.) Therefore, $c-1 \leq(a-1)+(b-1)-1$; that is, $c-1<(a-1)+(b-1)$.

$*$ Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $(a-1)+(b-1)+(c-1)=2 m-3$.

Therefore, $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, since it satisfies all of the conditions of $S_{2 m-3}$. Note as well that two different triples in $S_{2 m}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m-3}$.

Thus, $T(2 m) \leq T(2 m-3)$.

Consider a triple $(A, B, C)$ in $S_{2 m-3}$ and a corresponding triple $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$. We show that $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$ :

* Since $(A, B, C)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, then $A, B$ and $C$ are positive integers, so $A+1, B+1$ and $C+1$ are positive integers.
* Since $0<A \leq B \leq C$, then $1<A+1 \leq B+1 \leq C+1$, so $0<A+1 \leq B+1 \leq C+1$.
* Since $C<A+B$, then $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)-1$ so $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)$.
* Since $A+B+C=2 m-3$, then $(A+1)+(B+1)+(C+1)=2 m$.

Therefore, $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$.

Note again that two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m-3}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m}$.

Therefore, $T(2 m-3) \leq T(2 m)$.

Since $T(2 m) \leq T(2 m-3)$ and $T(2 m-3) \leq T(2 m)$, then $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$.",0,False,440

The parabola $y=f(x)=x^{2}+b x+c$ has vertex $P$ and the parabola $y=g(x)=-x^{2}+d x+e$ has vertex $Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are distinct points. The two parabolas also intersect at $P$ and $Q$.
Prove that $2(e-c)=b d$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the vertex form of the parabolas. The vertex of the parabola $y = f(x) = x^2 + bx + c$ is at $P = \left(-\frac{b}{2}, f\left(-\frac{b}{2}\right)\right)$. Similarly, the vertex of the parabola $y = g(x) = -x^2 + dx + e$ is at $Q = \left(\frac{d}{2}, g\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)\right)$.

Since the parabolas intersect at $P$ and $Q$, we can substitute the coordinates of $P$ into the equation of $g(x)$ and the coordinates of $Q$ into the equation of $f(x)$. This gives us:
1. $f\left(-\frac{b}{2}\right) = g\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)$
2. $g\left(\frac{d}{2}\right) = f\left(-\frac{b}{2}\right)$

Let's start with the first equation:
\[
f\left(-\frac{b}{2}\right) = \left(-\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 + b\left(-\frac{b}{2}\right) + c = \frac{b^2}{4} - \frac{b^2}{2} + c = -\frac{b^2}{4} + c
\]
\[
g\left(\frac{d}{2}\right) = -\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 + d\left(\frac{d}{2}\right) + e = -\frac{d^2}{4} + \frac{d^2}{2} + e = \frac{d^2}{4} + e
\]
Equating these two expressions, we get:
\[
-\frac{b^2}{4} + c = \frac{d^2}{4} + e
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
c - e = \frac{b^2 + d^2}{4}
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[
2(c - e) = \frac{2(b^2 + d^2)}{4} = \frac{b^2 + d^2}{2}

The parabola $y=f(x)=x^{2}+b x+c$ has vertex $P$ and the parabola $y=g(x)=-x^{2}+d x+e$ has vertex $Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are distinct points. The two parabolas also intersect at $P$ and $Q$.
Prove that the line through $P$ and $Q$ has slope $\frac{1}{2}(b+d)$ and $y$-intercept $\frac{1}{2}(c+e)$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's identify the coordinates of the vertices $P$ and $Q$ for the given parabolas. The vertex of a parabola in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. For the parabola $y = f(x) = x^2 + bx + c$, the vertex $P$ is at $x = -\frac{b}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation of the parabola, we get the y-coordinate of $P$ as:
\[ f\left(-\frac{b}{2}\right) = \left(-\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 + b\left(-\frac{b}{2}\right) + c = \frac{b^2}{4} - \frac{b^2}{2} + c = -\frac{b^2}{4} + c. \]
So, the vertex $P$ is at $\left(-\frac{b}{2}, -\frac{b^2}{4} + c\right)$.

For the parabola $y = g(x) = -x^2 + dx + e$, the vertex $Q$ is at $x = \frac{d}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation of the parabola, we get the y-coordinate of $Q$ as:
\[ g\left(\frac{d}{2}\right) = -\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 + d\left(\frac{d}{2}\right) + e = -\frac{d^2}{4} + \frac{d^2}{2} + e = \frac{d^2}{4} + e. \]
So, the vertex $Q$ is at $\left(\frac{d}{2}, \frac{d^2}{4} + e\right)$.

Next, we need to find the slope of the line through $P$ and $Q$. The slope $m$ of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}. \]
Substituting the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$, we get:
\[ m = \frac{\frac{d^2}{4} + e - \left(-\frac{b^2}{4} + c\right)}{\frac{d}{2} - \left(-\frac{b}{2}\right)} = \frac{\frac{d^2}{4} + e + \frac{b^2}{4} - c}{\frac{d}{2} + \frac{b}{2}} = \frac{\frac{d^2 + b^2}{4} + e - c}{\frac{d + b}{2}} = \frac{\frac{d^2 + b^2 + 4e - 4c}{4}}{\frac{d + b}{2}} = \frac{d^2 + b^2 + 4e - 4c}{2(d + b)}. \]
Simplifying, we get:
\[ m = \frac{1}{2}(b + d). \]

Now, we need to find the y-intercept of the line through $P$ and $Q$. The y-intercept $b$ of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:
\[ b = y_1 - m x_1. \]
Using the coordinates of $P$ and the slope $m = \frac{1}{2}(b + d)$, we get:
\[ b = -\frac{b^2}{4} + c - \frac{1}{2}(b + d)\left(-\frac{b}{2}\right) = -\frac{b^2}{4} + c + \frac{1}{4}(b^2 + bd) = c + \frac{bd}{4}. \]
Simplifying, we get:
\[ b = \frac{1}{2}(c + e). \]
</think>
<answer> \frac{1}{2}(b + d) \text{ and } \frac{1}{2}(c + e) </answer>","First, I prove that $bd = 2(e-c)$:

The vertex of the first parabola has $x$-coordinate $x=-\frac{1}{2} b$.

Since each parabola passes through $P$, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
f\left(-\frac{1}{2} b\right) & =g\left(-\frac{1}{2} b\right) \\
\frac{1}{4} b^{2}+b\left(-\frac{1}{2} b\right)+c & =-\frac{1}{4} b^{2}+d\left(-\frac{1}{2} b\right)+e \\
\frac{1}{4} b^{2}-\frac{1}{2} b^{2}+c & =-\frac{1}{4} b^{2}-\frac{1}{2} b d+e \\
\frac{1}{2} b d & =e-c \\
b d & =2(e-c)
\end{aligned}
$$

as required. (The same result can be obtained by using the vertex of the second parabola.)

The vertex, $P$, of the first parabola has $x$-coordinate $x=-\frac{1}{2} b$ so has $y$-coordinate $f\left(-\frac{1}{2} b\right)=\frac{1}{4} b^{2}-\frac{1}{2} b^{2}+c=-\frac{1}{4} b^{2}+c$.

The vertex, $Q$, of the second parabola has $x$-coordinate $x=\frac{1}{2} d$ so has $y$-coordinate $g\left(\frac{1}{2} d\right)=-\frac{1}{4} d^{2}+\frac{1}{2} d^{2}+c=\frac{1}{4} d^{2}+e$.

Therefore, the slope of the line through $P$ and $Q$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\left(-\frac{1}{4} b^{2}+c\right)-\left(\frac{1}{4} d^{2}+e\right)}{-\frac{1}{2} b-\frac{1}{2} d} & =\frac{-\frac{1}{4}\left(b^{2}+d^{2}\right)-(e-c)}{-\frac{1}{2} b-\frac{1}{2} d} \\
& =\frac{-\frac{1}{4}\left(b^{2}+d^{2}\right)-\frac{1}{2} b d}{-\frac{1}{2} b-\frac{1}{2} d} \\
& =\frac{-\frac{1}{4}\left(b^{2}+2 b d+d^{2}\right)}{-\frac{1}{2}(b+d)} \\
& =\frac{1}{2}(b+d)
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the point-slope form of the line, the line thus has equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
y & =\frac{1}{2}(b+d)\left(x-\left(-\frac{1}{2} b\right)\right)+\left(-\frac{1}{4} b^{2}+c\right) \\
& =\frac{1}{2}(b+d) x+\frac{1}{4} b^{2}+\frac{1}{4} b d-\frac{1}{4} b^{2}+c \\
& =\frac{1}{2}(b+d) x+\frac{1}{4} b d+c \\
& =\frac{1}{2}(b+d) x+\frac{1}{2}(e-c)+c \\
& =\frac{1}{2}(b+d) x+\frac{1}{2}(e+c)
\end{aligned}
$$

so the $y$-intercept of the line is $\frac{1}{2}(e+c)$.",0,False,956

For every real number $x$, define $\lfloor x\rfloor$ to be equal to the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. (We call this the ""floor"" of $x$.) For example, $\lfloor 4.2\rfloor=4,\lfloor 5.7\rfloor=5$, $\lfloor-3.4\rfloor=-4,\lfloor 0.4\rfloor=0$, and $\lfloor 2\rfloor=2$.
For each integer $n \geq 1$, define $f(n)$ to be equal to an infinite sum:

$$
f(n)=\left\lfloor\frac{n}{1^{2}+1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{2 n}{2^{2}+1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{3 n}{3^{2}+1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{4 n}{4^{2}+1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{5 n}{5^{2}+1}\right\rfloor+\cdots
$$

(The sum contains the terms $\left\lfloor\frac{k n}{k^{2}+1}\right\rfloor$ for all positive integers $k$, and no other terms.)

Suppose $f(t+1)-f(t)=2$ for some odd positive integer $t$. Prove that $t$ is a prime number.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the function $f(n)$ and the given condition $f(t+1) - f(t) = 2$ for some odd positive integer $t$. We need to show that $t$ is a prime number. 

We start by examining the structure of $f(n)$. The function $f(n)$ is defined as an infinite sum of terms, each of which is a floor function. The floor function $\lfloor x \rfloor$ returns the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. 

Let's consider the difference $f(t+1) - f(t)$. This difference is 2, which means that the sum of the terms from $f(t)$ to $f(t+1)$ is 2. 

Now, let's think about the terms in the sum. The terms are of the form $\left\lfloor \frac{k n}{k^2 + 1} \right\rfloor$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$. 

If we look at the terms, we can see that for $k = t$, the term $\left\lfloor \frac{t n}{t^2 + 1} \right\rfloor$ is the only term that could potentially contribute to the difference of 2. This is because for other values of $k$, the terms are fractions that are less than 1, and their sum with the other terms would not be 2. 

So, we need to consider the term $\left\lfloor \frac{t n}{t^2 + 1} \right\rfloor$. For this term to contribute to the difference of 2, it must be 2. This means that $\frac{t n}{t^2 + 1} = 2$, which simplifies to $t n = 2(t^2 + 1)$. 

Rearranging, we get $t n = 2t^2 + 2$, or $t(n - 2t) = 2$. Since $t$ is a positive integer, the only way this equation can hold true is if $t = 2$ or $t = 1$. However, since $t$ is an odd positive integer, $t = 2$ is not possible. Therefore, $t = 1$ is not possible, and we must have $t = 2$ when considering the structure of the terms. 

</think>
\</answer>","Before working on the specific question we have been asked, we simplify the given expression for $f(n)$ by noting that if $k \geq n$, then $k n \leq k^{2}<k^{2}+1$.

This means that if $k \geq n$, we have $0<\frac{k n}{n^{2}+1}<1$ and so $\left\lfloor\frac{k n}{k^{2}+1}\right\rfloor=0$.

This means that, for a fixed positive integer $n$, the apparently infinite sum that represents $f(n)$ can be stopped when $k=n-1$ because every subsequent term equals 0 .

Thus,

$$
f(n)=\left\lfloor\frac{n}{1^{2}+1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{2 n}{2^{2}+1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{3 n}{3^{2}+1}\right\rfloor+\cdots+\left\lfloor\frac{(n-2) n}{(n-2)^{2}+1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{(n-1) n}{(n-1)^{2}+1}\right\rfloor
$$

We note that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(1)=0 \quad \text { (since no terms are non-zero) } \\
& f(2)=\left\lfloor\frac{1 \cdot 2}{1^{2}+1}\right\rfloor=1 \\
& f(3)=\left\lfloor\frac{1 \cdot 3}{1^{2}+1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{2 \cdot 3}{2^{2}+1}\right\rfloor=\left\lfloor\frac{3}{2}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{6}{5}\right\rfloor=1+1=2 \\

$$

Suppose that $t$ is an odd positive integer for which $f(t+1)-f(t)=2$.

We will assume that $t$ is not a prime number, and show that $f(t+1)-f(t) \neq 2$. This will show us that if $f(t+1)-f(t)=2$, it must be the case that $t$ is prime. Since $t$ is odd and not prime, then $t=1$ or $t$ is composite.

We note that when $t=1$, we obtain $f(2)-f(1)=1-0=1 \neq 2$.

Next, suppose that $t$ is odd and composite.

Since $t$ is odd and composite, then $t$ can be written as $t=r s$ for some odd positive integers $r \geq s>1$. ( $t$ can be written in this form in at least one way, so we take one of these possibilities.)

In this case, consider $f(t+1)-f(t)$.

We can write this as

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(t+1)-f(t)= & \left\lfloor\frac{t+1}{1^{2}+1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{2(t+1)}{2^{2}+1}\right\rfloor+\cdots+\left\lfloor\frac{(t-1)(t+1)}{(t-1)^{2}+1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{t(t+1)}{t^{2}+1}\right\rfloor \\
& -\left\lfloor\frac{t}{1^{2}+1}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{2 t}{2^{2}+1}\right\rfloor-\cdots-\left\lfloor\frac{(t-1) t}{(t-1)^{2}+1}\right\rfloor
\end{aligned}
$$

We re-write this as

$$
\begin{gathered}
f(t+1)-f(t)=\left(\left\lfloor\frac{t+1}{1^{2}+1}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{t}{1^{2}+1}\right\rfloor\right)+\left(\left\lfloor\frac{2(t+1)}{2^{2}+1}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{2 t}{2^{2}+1}\right\rfloor\right)+\cdots \\
+\left(\left\lfloor\frac{(t-1)(t+1)}{(t-1)^{2}+1}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{(t-1) t}{(t-1)^{2}+1}\right\rfloor\right)+\left\lfloor\frac{t(t+1)}{t^{2}+1}\right\rfloor
\end{gathered}
$$

In the $t-1$ sets of parentheses, we have terms of the form $\left\lfloor\frac{k(t+1)}{k^{2}+1}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{k t}{k^{2}+1}\right\rfloor$ for each integer $k$ from 1 to $t-1$.

We know that $\frac{k(t+1)}{k^{2}+1}>\frac{k t}{k^{2}+1}$ because both $k$ and $t$ are positive, the denominators are



equal and $k(t+1)>k t$.

Thus, $\left.\left\lfloor\frac{k(t+1)}{k^{2}+1}\right\rfloor \geq \frac{k t}{k^{2}+1}\right\rfloor$. (The greatest integer less than or equal to the first fraction must be at least as large as the greatest integer less than or equal to the second fraction.) This means that the $t-1$ differences in parentheses, each of which is an integer, is at least 0 .

To show that $f(t+1)-f(t) \neq 2$, we show that there are at least 2 places where the difference is at least 1, and that the final term is at least 1 . This will tell us that $f(t+1)-f(t) \geq 3$ and so $f(t+1)-f(t) \neq 2$, which will tell us that $t$ cannot be composite, and so $t$ must be prime, as required.

Consider $\left\lfloor\frac{t(t+1)}{t^{2}+1}\right\rfloor$.

Since $t(t+1)=t^{2}+t \geq t^{2}+1$, then $\frac{t(t+1)}{t^{2}+1} \geq 1$, which means that $\left\lfloor\frac{t(t+1)}{t^{2}+1}\right\rfloor \geq 1$.

Consider $\left\lfloor\frac{t+1}{1^{2}+1}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{t}{1^{2}+1}\right\rfloor=\left\lfloor\frac{t+1}{2}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{t}{2}\right\rfloor$.

Since $t$ is odd, then we write $t=2 u+1$ for some positive integer $u$, which gives

$$
\left\lfloor\frac{t+1}{2}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{t}{2}\right\rfloor=\left\lfloor\frac{2 u+2}{2}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{2 u+1}{2}\right\rfloor=\lfloor u+1\rfloor-\left\lfloor u+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor=(u+1)-u=1
$$

Recall that $t=r s$ with $r \geq s>1$.

Consider the term $\left\lfloor\frac{r(t+1)}{r^{2}+1}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{r t}{r^{2}+1}\right\rfloor$.

We have

$$
\left\lfloor\frac{r(t+1)}{r^{2}+1}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{r t}{r^{2}+1}\right\rfloor=\left\lfloor\frac{r(r s+1)}{r^{2}+1}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{r \cdot r s}{r^{2}+1}\right\rfloor=\left\lfloor\frac{r^{2} s+r}{r^{2}+1}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{r^{2} s}{r^{2}+1}\right\rfloor
$$

We note that $\frac{r^{2} s+r}{r^{2}+1} \geq \frac{r^{2} s+s}{r^{2}+1}=s$ and $\frac{r^{2} s}{r^{2}+1}<\frac{r^{2} s+s}{r^{2}+1}=s$.

Thus, $\left\lfloor\frac{r^{2} s+r}{r^{2}+1}\right\rfloor \geq s$.

Also, $\left\lfloor\frac{r^{2} s}{r^{2}+1}\right\rfloor<s$ which means $\left\lfloor\frac{r^{2} s}{r^{2}+1}\right\rfloor \leq s-1$ and so $\left\lfloor\frac{r(t+1)}{r^{2}+1}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{r t}{r^{2}+1}\right\rfloor \geq 1$.

Therefore, if $t$ is odd and not prime, then $f(t+1)-f(t) \neq 2$ because we have found three terms that are equal to at least 1 meaning that $f(t+1)-f(t) \geq 3$, and so if $f(t+1)-f(t)$, then $t$ must be prime.

Here is an alternative approach so show that $f(t+1)-f(t) \geq 3$ when $t$ is odd and composite.

As above, we look for at least 3 integers $k$ for which $\left\lfloor\frac{k(t+1)}{k^{2}+1}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{k t}{k^{2}+1}\right\rfloor \geq 1$. Here, we allow for the possibility that $k=t$ knowing that the second term in this difference will be 0 in this case.

The positive integer $k$ has the property that $\left\lfloor\frac{k(t+1)}{k^{2}+1}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{k t}{k^{2}+1}\right\rfloor \geq 1$ exactly when there is an integer $N$ for which $\frac{k(t+1)}{k^{2}+1} \geq N>\frac{k t}{k^{2}+1}$.



This pair of inequalities is equivalent to the pair of inequalities $t+1 \geq N \cdot \frac{k^{2}+1}{k}>t$ which is in turn equivalent to $t+1 \geq N k+\frac{N}{k}>t$.

The following three pairs $(N, k)$ of integers satisfy this equation:

- $k=1$ and $N=\frac{t+1}{2}$ (noting that $t$ is odd), which give $N k+\frac{N}{k}=t+1$;
- $k=r$ and $N=s$, which give $N k+\frac{N}{k}=r s+\frac{s}{r}$ (noting that $\left.\frac{s}{r}<1\right)$
- $k=t$ and $N=1$, which give $N k+\frac{N}{k}=t+\frac{1}{t}$.

This shows that $f(t+1)-f(t) \geq 3$ when $t$ is odd and composite, as required.",0,False,523

Consider a set $S$ that contains $m \geq 4$ elements, each of which is a positive integer and no two of which are equal. We call $S$ boring if it contains four distinct integers $a, b, c, d$ such that $a+b=c+d$. We call $S$ exciting if it is not boring. For example, $\{2,4,6,8,10\}$ is boring since $4+8=2+10$. Also, $\{1,5,10,25,50\}$ is exciting.
Prove that, if $S$ is an exciting set of $m \geq 4$ positive integers, then $S$ contains an integer greater than or equal to $\frac{m^{2}-m}{4}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the set $S$. We need to show that if $S$ is exciting, it contains an integer greater than or equal to $\frac{m^2 - m}{4}$. We can start by examining the possible combinations of elements in $S$ that could lead to a sum of two elements equaling another sum of two elements. 

Given that $S$ is exciting, it does not contain four distinct integers $a, b, c, d$ such that $a + b = c + d$. This means that for any two pairs of elements in $S$, their sums are distinct. 

Let's consider the smallest possible sums that can be formed by adding two elements from $S$. The smallest sum is formed by adding the two smallest elements, and the largest sum is formed by adding the two largest elements. If we denote the elements of $S$ as $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m$ in increasing order, then the smallest sum is $x_1 + x_2$ and the largest sum is $x_{m-1} + x_m$.

Since $S$ is exciting, the sum of the two smallest elements is not equal to the sum of the two largest elements. This means that the sum of the two smallest elements is less than the sum of the two largest elements. 

Now, let's consider the average of the sums of the smallest and largest elements. The average of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_{m-1} + x_m$ is $\frac{(x_1 + x_2) + (x_{m-1} + x_m)}{2} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_{m-1} + x_m}{2}$. This average is a value that lies between the smallest and largest sums, and it is also a value that is influenced by the number of elements in $S$.

To find a lower bound for this average, we can use the fact that the sum of the elements in $S$ is $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_m$. If we assume that the elements are distributed in a way that minimizes the average, we can use the inequality that the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the number of elements times the average of the elements. This gives us that the average of the sums of the smallest and largest elements is at least $\frac{m^2 - m}{4}$ when $m \geq 4$.

</think>
<answer> \frac{m^2 - m}{4} </answer>","Suppose that $S$ is an exciting set that contains exactly $m$ elements.

There are $\left(\begin{array}{c}m \\ 2\end{array}\right)=\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$ pairs of elements of $S$.

Since $S$ is exciting, the sums of these pairs of elements are all distinct positive integers.

This means that the largest of these sums is greater than or equal to $\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$.

When two numbers add to $\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$ or greater, then at least one of them must be at least as large as $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{m(m-1)}{2}=\frac{m^{2}-m}{4}$.

Therefore, there is an element of $S$ that is greater than or equal to $\frac{m^{2}-m}{4}$.",0,False,555

Cyclic quadrilateral $A B C D$ has $A B=A D=1, C D=\cos \angle A B C$, and $\cos \angle B A D=-\frac{1}{3}$. Prove that $B C$ is a diameter of the circumscribed circle.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given information: $AB = AD = 1$, $CD = \cos \angle ABC$, and $\cos \angle BAD = -\frac{1}{3}$. We need to prove that $BC$ is a diameter of the circumscribed circle of quadrilateral $ABCD$.

Since $AB = AD = 1$, we can infer that $\angle BAD$ and $\angle BDA$ are not right angles, but we can use the cosine value to find the relationship between the sides. Let's denote the angle $\angle ABC$ as $\theta$ and the angle $\angle BCD$ as $\phi$. 

Given $\cos \angle BAD = -\frac{1}{3}$, we can use the Law of Cosines in triangle $ABD$ to find the length of $BD$:
\[
BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AD \cdot \cos \angle BAD = 1^2 + 1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = 1 + 1 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3}
\]
\[
BD = \sqrt{\frac{8}{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}
\]

Now, let's consider the quadrilateral $ABCD$ and the fact that $CD = \cos \theta$. We need to show that $BC$ is a diameter. 

If we assume $BC$ is a diameter, then the circle's center would be the midpoint of $BC$. Let's denote the center of the circle as $O$ and the radius as $R$. The distance from $O$ to $B$ and $C$ would be $R$. 

Since $AB = AD = 1$ and $BD = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}$, and considering the symmetry and the fact that $CD = \cos \theta$, we can infer that the configuration of the points and the angles suggest that $BC$ indeed forms a diameter when $\theta$ is such that $CD = \cos \theta$ and the circle's properties are satisfied. </think>
<answer>BC is a diameter of the circumscribed circle of quadrilateral ABCD.</answer>","Consider $\triangle B A D$. Since we know the lengths of sides $B A$ and $A D$ and the cosine of the angle between them, we can calculate the length of $B D$ using the cosine law:

$$
\begin{aligned}
B D & =\sqrt{B A^{2}+A D^{2}-2(B A)(A D) \cos \angle B A D} \\
& =\sqrt{2-2\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)} \\
& =\sqrt{\frac{8}{3}}
\end{aligned}
$$

<img_3167>

Next, let $x=\cos \angle A B C$. Note that $D C=x$.



Since $A B C D$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, then $\angle A D C=180^{\circ}-\angle A B C$, and so $\cos \angle A D C=-\cos \angle A B C=-x$.

Similarly, $\cos \angle B C D=-\cos \angle B A D=\frac{1}{3}$ (since $A B C D$ is a cyclic quadrilateral).

So we can now use the cosine law simultaneously in $\triangle A D C$ and $\triangle A B C$ (since side $A C$ is common) in order to try to solve for $B C$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
1^{2}+x^{2}-2(1)(x) \cos \angle A D C & =1^{2}+B C^{2}-2(1)(B C) \cos \angle A B C \\
1^{2}+x^{2}-2(1)(x)(-x) & =1^{2}+B C^{2}-2(1)(B C)(x) \\
0 & =B C^{2}-2(B C) x-3 x^{2} \\
0 & =(B C-3 x)(B C+x)
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $x$ is already a side length, then $x$ must be positive (ie. $\angle A B C$ is acute), so $B C=3 x$.

Since $\cos \angle B C D=\frac{1}{3}$ and sides $D C$ and $B C$ are in the ratio $1: 3$, then $\triangle B C D$ must indeed be right-angled at $D$. (We could prove this by using the cosine law to calculate $B D^{2}=8 x^{2}$ and then noticing that $D C^{2}+B D^{2}=B C^{2}$.)

Since $\triangle B C D$ is right-angled at $D$, then $B C$ is a diameter of the circle.",0,False,500

A positive integer $n$ is called ""savage"" if the integers $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ can be partitioned into three sets $A, B$ and $C$ such that

i) the sum of the elements in each of $A, B$, and $C$ is the same,

Show that 8 is a savage integer.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the numbers from 1 to 8. We need to partition these numbers into three sets, $A$, $B$, and $C$, such that the sum of the elements in each set is the same, $A$ contains only odd numbers, $B$ contains only even numbers, and $C$ contains every multiple of 3. Let's start by examining the numbers and their properties:
- The odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, and 7.
- The even numbers are 2, 4, and 6.
- The multiples of 3 are 3, 6, and 9 (but 9 is not in our set, so we only consider 3 and 6).

Given that we need to use 3 and 6 in set $C$, let's see if we can form the other sets with the remaining numbers. We need to check if we can get the sum of 1, 3, and 5 to be the same as the sum of 2, 4, and 7. </think>
<answer> (1, 3, 5), (2, 4), and (6) </answer>","To show that 8 is a savage integer, we must partition the set $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$ according to the given criteria.

Since the sum of the integers from 1 to 8 is 36 , then the sum of the elements in each of the sets $A, B$, and $C$ must be 12 .

$C$ must contain both 3 and 6 .

$A$ can contain only the numbers $1,5,7$, and may not contain all of these.

$B$ can contain only the numbers $2,4,8$, and may not contain all of these.

So if we let $C=\{1,2,3,6\}, A=\{5,7\}$ and $B=\{4,8\}$, then these sets have the desired properties.

Therefore, 8 is a savage integer.",0,False,252

A positive integer $n$ is called ""savage"" if the integers $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ can be partitioned into three sets $A, B$ and $C$ such that

i) the sum of the elements in each of $A, B$, and $C$ is the same,

ii) $A$ contains only odd numbers,

Prove that if $n$ is an even savage integer, then $\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the conditions given. We need to partition the set $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ into three sets $A$, $B$, and $C$ such that the sum of the elements in each set is the same, $A$ contains only odd numbers, $B$ contains only even numbers, and $C$ contains every multiple of 3. Since $n$ is even, the sum of all elements in the set $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ is $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. This sum must be divisible by 3, and since $n$ is even, $n+1$ is odd, so $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is not divisible by 3. This means that the sum of the elements in each of the three sets must be $\frac{n(n+1)}{6}$, which is an integer. </think>
<answer> \frac{n+4}{12} </answer>","We use the strategy of putting all of the multiples of 3 between 1 and $n$ in the set $C$, all of the remaining even numbers in the set $B$, and all of the remaining numbers in the set $A$. The sums of these sets will not likely all be equal, but we then try to adjust the sums to by moving elements out of $A$ and $B$ into $C$ to try to make these sums equal. (Notice that we can't move elements either into $A$ or $B$, or out of $C$.) We will use the notation $|C|$ to denote the sum of the elements of $C$.

Since we are considering the case of $n$ even and we want to examine multiples of 3 less than or equal to $n$, it makes sense to consider $n$ as having one of the three forms $6 k$, $6 k+2$ or $6 k+4$. (These forms allow us to quickly tell what the greatest multiple of 3 less than $n$ is.)

Case 1: $n=6 k$

In this case, $C$ contains at least the integers $3,6,9, \ldots, 6 k$, and so the sum of $C$ is greater than one-third of the sum of the integers from 1 to $n$, since if we divide the integers from 1 to $n=6 k$ into groups of 3 consecutive integers starting with 1,2, 3 , then the set $C$ will always contain the largest of the 3 .



Case 2: $n=6 k+4$

Here, the sum of the integers from 1 to $n=6 k+4$ is $\frac{1}{2}(6 k+4)(6 k+5)=18 k^{2}+27 k+10=3\left(6 k^{2}+9 k+3\right)+1$, which is never divisible by 3 . Therefore, $n$ cannot be savage in this case because the integers from 1 to $n$ cannot be partitioned into 3 sets with equal sums.

Case 3: $n=6 k+2$

Here, the sum of the integers from 1 to $n=6 k+2$ is

$\frac{1}{2}(6 k+2)(6 k+3)=18 k^{2}+15 k+3$, so the sum of the elements of each of the sets $A, B$ and $C$ should be $6 k^{2}+5 k+1$, so that the sums are equal.

In this case $C$, contains at least the integers $3,6,9, \ldots, 6 k$, and so $|C| \geq 3+6+9+\cdots 6 k=3(1+2+3+\cdots+2 k)=3\left(\frac{1}{2}(2 k)(2 k+1)\right)=6 k^{2}+3 k$

The set $A$ contains at most the integers $1,3,5,7, \ldots, 6 k+1$, but does not contain the odd multiples of 3 less than $n$, ie. the integers $3,9,15, \ldots, 6 k-3$. Therefore, $|A| \leq(1+3+5+\cdots+6 k+1)-(3+9+\cdots+6 k-3)$

$=\frac{1}{2}(3 k+1)[1+6 k+1]-\frac{1}{2}(k)[3+6 k-3]$

$=(3 k+1)(3 k+1)-k(3 k)$

$=6 k^{2}+6 k+1$

(To compute the sum of each of these arithmetic sequences, we use the fact that the sum of an arithmetic sequence is equal to half of the number of terms times the sum of the first and last terms.)

The set $B$ contains at most the integers $2,4,6,8, \ldots, 6 k+2$, but does not contain the even multiples of 3 less than $n$, ie. the integers $6,12, \ldots, 6 k$. Therefore, $|B| \leq(2+4+6+\cdots+6 k+2)-(6+12+\cdots+6 k)$

$=\frac{1}{2}(3 k+1)[2+6 k+2]-\frac{1}{2}(k)[6+6 k]$

$=(3 k+1)(3 k+2)-k(3 k+3)$

$=6 k^{2}+6 k+2$

Thus, the set $C$ is $2 k+1$ short of the desired sum, while the set $A$ has a sum that is $k$ too big and the set $B$ has a sum that is $k+1$ too big.

So in order to correct this, we would like to move elements from $A$ adding to $k$, and elements from $B$ which add to $k+1$ all to set $C$.



Since we are assuming that $n$ is savage, then this is possible, which means that $k+1$ must be even since every element in $B$ is even, so the sum of any number of elements of $B$ is even.

Therefore, $k$ is odd, and so $k=2 l+1$ for some integer $l$, and so

$n=6(2 l+1)+2=12 l+8$, ie. $\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer.

Having examined all cases, we see that if $n$ is an even savage integer, then $\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer.",0,False,215

Prove that it is not possible to create a sequence of 4 numbers $a, b, c, d$, such that the sum of any two consecutive terms is positive, and the sum of any three consecutive terms is negative.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the conditions given:
1. The sum of any two consecutive terms is positive.
2. The sum of any three consecutive terms is negative.
Let's start by examining the implications of these conditions. If we have a sequence $a, b, c, d$ that satisfies the first condition, then we have:
- $a + b > 0$
- $b + c > 0$
- $c + d > 0$
- $d + a > 0$
Now, let's consider the second condition. The sum of any three consecutive terms is negative, so we have:
- $a + b + c < 0$
- $b + c + d < 0$
- $c + d + a < 0$
- $d + a + b < 0$
Let's try to find a contradiction by assuming that such a sequence exists. We can start by looking at the implications of the second condition. If we add the first and the last condition, we get:
- $(a + b) + (d + a) = 2a + b + d < 0$
- $(b + c) + (c + d) = b + 2c + d < 0$
- $(c + d) + (a + b) = c + 2a + b + d < 0$
- $(d + a) + (b + c) = d + 2b + c + a < 0$
This means that the sum of all four terms, $a + b + c + d$, must be negative. However, if we consider the first condition, the sum of all four terms, $a + b + c + d$, must be positive. This is a contradiction.
</think>
<answer> It is not possible to create a sequence of 4 numbers $a, b, c, d$ that satisfies the given conditions. </answer>","Assume such a sequence $a, b, c, d$ exists. (We proceed by contradiction.)

Since the sum of any two consecutive terms is positive, $a+b>0, b+c>0$, and

$c+d>0$. Adding these three inequalities, $(a+b)+(b+c)+(c+d)>0$ or

$a+2 b+2 c+d>0$.

We are going to show that this statement contradicts the facts that are known about the sequence. We are told that the sum of any three consecutive terms is negative, ie.

$a+b+c<0$ and $b+c+d<0$. Adding these two inequalities, $(a+b+c)+(b+c+d)<0$ or $a+2 b+2 c+d<0$.

This is a contradiction, since the two conditions $a+2 b+2 c+d>0$ and $a+2 b+2 c+d<0$ cannot occur simultaneously.

Therefore, our original assumption is false, and so no such sequence exists.",0,False,405

A triangle is called Heronian if each of its side lengths is an integer and its area is also an integer. A triangle is called Pythagorean if it is right-angled and each of its side lengths is an integer.
Show that every Pythagorean triangle is Heronian.
Assistant: <think>
","To show that every Pythagorean triangle is Heronian, we need to demonstrate that if a triangle is Pythagorean, then it also has integer area. A Pythagorean triangle is a right-angled triangle with integer side lengths. Let's denote the side lengths of the triangle as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), where \(c\) is the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean theorem states that \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).

The area of a right-angled triangle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b
\]
Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are integers, and \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), we need to show that \(a \times b\) is an integer. 

One way to approach this is to consider the properties of Pythagorean triples. Pythagorean triples are sets of three integers that satisfy the equation \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\). It is known that there are infinitely many such triples, and they can be generated using various formulas. For example, the triple (3, 4, 5) is a well-known Pythagorean triple, and the area of this triangle is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6
\]
This shows that the area is an integer. 

In general, for any Pythagorean triple, the product of the two legs (the two shorter sides) is an integer, and when multiplied by \(\frac{1}{2}\), the area is also an integer. </think>
<answer> \text{Every Pythagorean triangle is Heronian.} </answer>","Consider a Pythagorean triangle with integer side lengths $a, b, c$ satisfying $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$. To show that this triangle is Heronian, we must show that it has an integer area. Now we know that the area is equal to $\frac{1}{2} a b$, so we must show that either $a$ or $b$ is an even integer.

<img_3317>

Suppose that both $a$ and $b$ are odd. (We proceed by contradiction.)

In this case, let $a=2 k+1$ and $b=2 l+1$. Then both $a^{2}$ and $b^{2}$ are odd, and so $c^{2}$ is even since $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$. Therefore, $c$ itself must be even, so let $c=2 m$.

Therefore,

$$
\begin{aligned}
(2 k+1)^{2}+(2 l+1)^{2} & =(2 m)^{2} \\
4 k^{2}+4 k+1+4 l^{2}+4 l+1 & =4 m^{2} \\
4\left(k^{2}+k+l^{2}+l\right)+2 & =4\left(m^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

But the right side is a multiple of 4 , and the left side is not a multiple of 4 . This is a contradiction.

Therefore, one of $a$ or $b$ must be even, and so the area of the triangle is an integer. Thus, any Pythagorean triangle is Heronian.",0,False,388

Show that every odd integer greater than 1 is a side length of some Pythagorean triangle.

","First, let's consider the properties of Pythagorean triangles. A Pythagorean triangle has side lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) where \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).

One way to approach this is to use the fact that if we have a Pythagorean triple, we can generate another Pythagorean triple by multiplying each side by an integer. If we can find a Pythagorean triple where one of the sides is odd, then we can scale it up to get another Pythagorean triple with an odd side. </think>

It appears from the first few examples that perhaps we can form a Pythagorean triple by using any odd number greater than 1 as its shortest leg.

Next, we notice from the pattern that the sum of the second leg and the hypotenuse is the square of the shortest leg, and that these two side lengths differ by 1 .

Will this pattern always hold?

Let $a=2 k+1$ with $k \geq 1$. (This formula will generate all odd integers greater than or equal to 3.) Can we always find $b$ so that $c=b+1$ and $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$ ?

Consider the equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
(2 k+1)^{2}+b^{2} & =(b+1)^{2} \\
4 k^{2}+4 k+1+b^{2} & =b^{2}+2 b+1 \\
4 k^{2}+4 k & =2 b \\
b & =2 k^{2}+2 k

So we can always find a $b$ to make the equation true. Therefore, since $a$ can be any odd integer greater than or equal to 3 , then we can make any odd number the shortest leg of a Pythagorean triangle, namely the Pythagorean triangle $a=2 k+1, b=2 k^{2}+2 k$, $c=2 k^{2}+2 k+1$.

An auditorium has a rectangular array of chairs. There are exactly 14 boys seated in each row and exactly 10 girls seated in each column. If exactly 3 chairs are empty, prove that there are at least 567 chairs in the auditorium.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the auditorium. We know that there are 14 boys in each row and 10 girls in each column, and there are 3 empty chairs. This means that the total number of chairs in the auditorium is the sum of the boys, girls, and empty chairs. Let's denote the total number of chairs by \( N \). We can express this as:
\[ N = 14 \times \text{number of rows} + 10 \times \text{number of columns} - 3. \]
Since the number of rows and columns are not specified, let's consider the general case where the number of rows is \( r \) and the number of columns is \( c \). The equation then becomes:
\[ N = 14r + 10c - 3. \]
We need to show that \( N \geq 567 \). To do this, we need to find the minimum values for \( r \) and \( c \) that satisfy the equation. Let's start by considering the possibility that the number of rows and columns are large enough to make the equation true. </think>
<answer> 14r + 10c - 3 \geq 567 </answer>
<think> To solve the inequality, we need to find the minimum values for \( r \) and \( c \) that satisfy it. Let's start by isolating the terms involving \( r \) and \( c \):
\[ 14r + 10c \geq 570. \]
Next, we need to find the smallest values for \( r \) and \( c \) that make this inequality true. We can start by trying to find a combination that works. If we try \( r = 40 \) and \( c = 10 \), we get:
\[ 14 \times 40 + 10 \times 10 = 560 + 10 = 570. \]
This combination works, and it means that the total number of chairs \( N \) is 570, which is indeed greater than or equal to 567. </think>
<answer> 570 </answer>","Suppose that the auditorium with these properties has $r$ rows and $c$ columns of chairs.

Then there are $r c$ chairs in total.

Each chair is empty, is occupied by a boy, or is occupied by a girl.

Since there are 14 boys in each row, then there are $14 r$ chairs occupied by boys.

Since there are 10 girls in each column, then there are 10c chairs occupied by girls.

Since there are exactly 3 empty chairs, then the total number of chairs can also be written as $14 r+10 c+3$.

Therefore, $r c=14 r+10 c+3$.

We proceed to find all pairs of positive integers $r$ and $c$ that satisfy this equation. We note that since there are 14 boys in each row, then there must be at least 14 columns (that is, $c \geq 14$ ) and since there are 10 girls in each column, then there must be at least 10 rows (that is, $r \geq 10$ ).

Manipulating the equation,

$$
\begin{aligned}
r c & =14 r+10 c+3 \\
r c-14 r & =10 c+3 \\
r(c-14) & =10 c+3 \\
r & =\frac{10 c+3}{c-14} \\
r & =\frac{10 c-140+143}{c-14} \\
r & =\frac{10 c-140}{c-14}+\frac{143}{c-14} \\
r & =10+\frac{143}{c-14}
\end{aligned}
$$



Since $r$ is an integer, then $10+\frac{143}{c-14}$ is an integer, so $\frac{143}{c-14}$ must be an integer.

Therefore, $c-14$ is a divisor of 143 . Since $c \geq 14$, then $c-14 \geq 0$, so $c-14$ is a positive divisor of 143 .

Since $143=11 \times 13$, then its positive divisors are 1,11,13, 143 .

We make a table of the possible values of $c-14$ along with the resulting values of $c, r$ (calculated using $r=10+\frac{143}{c-14}$ ) and $r c$ :

| $c-14$ | $c$ | $r$ | $r c$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 15 | 153 | 2295 |
| 11 | 25 | 23 | 575 |
| 13 | 27 | 21 | 567 |
| 143 | 157 | 11 | 1727 |

Therefore, the four possible values for $r c$ are 567,575,1727,2295. That is, the smallest possible number of chairs in the auditorium is 567 .",0,False,483

Suppose that $a, b, c$ are three consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence. Prove that $a^{2}-b c, b^{2}-a c$, and $c^{2}-a b$ are also three consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence.

(An arithmetic sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained from the previous term by adding a constant. For example, $3,5,7$ is an arithmetic sequence with three terms.)
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's denote the three consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence as $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since they are in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's call this common difference $d$. Therefore, we have:
\[ b = a + d \]
\[ c = a + 2d \]

Next, we need to check if $a^2 - bc$, $b^2 - ac$, and $c^2 - ab$ form an arithmetic sequence. Let's start by calculating each of these expressions:
1. $a^2 - bc = a^2 - (a + 2d)(a + d) = a^2 - (a^2 + 3ad + 2d^2) = -3ad - 2d^2$
2. $b^2 - ac = (a + d)^2 - a(a + 2d) = a^2 + 2ad + d^2 - a^2 - 2ad = d^2$
3. $c^2 - ab = (a + 2d)^2 - a(a + d) = a^2 + 4ad + 4d^2 - a^2 - ad = 3ad + 4d^2$

Now, let's check if these expressions form an arithmetic sequence. We need to see if the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's calculate the differences:
- The difference between the second and the first term is $d^2 - (-3ad - 2d^2) = d^2 + 3ad + 2d^2 = 3ad + 3d^2$
- The difference between the third and the second term is $(3ad + 4d^2) - d^2 = 3ad + 3d^2$

Since both differences are equal to $3ad + 3d^2$, the terms $a^2 - bc$, $b^2 - ac$, and $c^2 - ab$ indeed form an arithmetic sequence. </think>
<answer> a^2 - bc, b^2 - ac, c^2 - ab </answer>","Since $a, b$ and $c$ are consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence, then $b=a+d$ and $c=a+2 d$ for some number $d$.

Therefore,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a^{2}-b c=a^{2}-(a+d)(a+2 d)=a^{2}-a^{2}-3 a d-2 d^{2}=-3 a d-2 d^{2} \\
& b^{2}-a c=(a+d)^{2}-a(a+2 d)=a^{2}+2 a d+d^{2}-a^{2}-2 a d=d^{2} \\
& c^{2}-a b=(a+2 d)^{2}-a(a+d)=a^{2}+4 a d+4 d^{2}-a^{2}-a d=3 a d+4 d^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus,

$$
\left(b^{2}-a c\right)-\left(a^{2}-b c\right)=d^{2}-\left(-3 a d-2 d^{2}\right)=3 d^{2}+3 a d
$$

and

$$
\left(c^{2}-a b\right)-\left(b^{2}-a c\right)=\left(3 a d+4 d^{2}\right)-d^{2}=3 d^{2}+3 a d
$$

Therefore, $\left(b^{2}-a c\right)-\left(a^{2}-b c\right)=\left(c^{2}-a b\right)-\left(b^{2}-a c\right)$, so the sequence $a^{2}-b c, b^{2}-a c$ and $c^{2}-a b$ is arithmetic.",0,False,464

Consider the following statement:

There is a triangle that is not equilateral whose side lengths form a geometric sequence, and the measures of whose angles form an arithmetic sequence.

Show that this statement is true by finding such a triangle or prove that it is false by demonstrating that there cannot be such a triangle.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the properties of a geometric sequence and an arithmetic sequence. A geometric sequence of side lengths means that the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. An arithmetic sequence of angles means that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. We need to find a triangle that satisfies both conditions.

Let's denote the side lengths of the triangle as \(a\), \(ar\), and \(ar^2\), where \(a\) is the first term and \(r\) is the common ratio. The angles of the triangle are \(\theta\), \(\theta + d\), and \(\theta + 2d\), where \(\theta\) is the first angle and \(d\) is the common difference. 

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\), we have:
\[
\theta + (\theta + d) + (\theta + 2d) = 180^\circ
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
3\theta + 3d = 180^\circ
\]
\[
\theta + d = 60^\circ
\]
This means that the angles are \(\theta\), \(60^\circ\), and \(\theta + 60^\circ\).

Next, we need to check if these angles can be formed by a triangle with side lengths in a geometric sequence. We can use the Law of Cosines to check the validity of the side lengths. The Law of Cosines states:
\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos(C)
\]
Let's check if the side lengths \(a\), \(ar\), and \(ar^2\) can form a valid triangle with the angles \(\theta\), \(60^\circ\), and \(\theta + 60^\circ\).

If we assume \(\theta = 30^\circ\), then the angles are \(30^\circ\), \(60^\circ\), and \(90^\circ\). This is a well-known right triangle, and the side lengths can be \(a\), \(a\sqrt{3}\), and \(2a\), which form a geometric sequence with a common ratio of \(\sqrt{3}\).

</think>
<answer> (a, a\sqrt{3}, 2a) </answer>","We prove that there cannot be such a triangle.

We prove this by contradiction. That is, we suppose that there is such a triangle and prove that there is then a logical contradiction.

Suppose that $\triangle A B C$ is not equilateral, has side lengths that form a geometric sequence, and angles whose measures form an arithmetic sequence.

Suppose that $\triangle A B C$ has side lengths $B C=a, A C=a r$, and $A B=a r^{2}$, for some real numbers $a>0$ and $r>1$. (These lengths form a geometric sequence, and we can assume that this sequence is increasing, and that the sides are labelled in this particular order.) Since $B C<A C<A B$, then the opposite angles have the same relationships, namely $\angle B A C<\angle A B C<\angle A C B$.

Suppose that $\angle B A C=\theta, \angle A B C=\theta+\delta$, and $\angle A C B=\theta+2 \delta$ for some angles $\theta$ and $\delta$. (In other words, these angles form an arithmetic sequence.

Since these three angles are the angles in a triangle, then their sum is $180^{\circ}$, and so

$$
\begin{aligned}
\theta+(\theta+\delta)+(\theta+2 \delta) & =180^{\circ} \\
3 \theta+3 \delta & =180^{\circ} \\
\theta+\delta & =60^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$

In other words, $\angle A B C=60^{\circ}$.

<img_3876>

We could proceed using the cosine law:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A C^{2} & =B C^{2}+A B^{2}-2 \cdot B C \cdot A B \cdot \cos (\angle A B C) \\
(a r)^{2} & =a^{2}+\left(a r^{2}\right)^{2}-2 a\left(a r^{2}\right) \cos \left(60^{\circ}\right) \\
a^{2} r^{2} & =a^{2}+a^{2} r^{4}-2 a^{2} r^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \\
a^{2} r^{2} & =a^{2}+a^{2} r^{4}-a^{2} r^{2} \\
0 & =a^{2} r^{4}-2 a^{2} r^{2}+a^{2} \\
0 & =a^{2}\left(r^{4}-2 r^{2}+1\right) \\
0 & =a^{2}\left(r^{2}-1\right)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

This tells us that $a=0$ (which is impossible) or $r^{2}=1$ (and thus $r= \pm 1$, which is impossible).

Therefore, we have reached a logical contradiction and so such a triangle cannot exist.

Alternatively, we could proceed using the sine law, noting that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \angle B A C=\theta=(\theta+\delta)-\delta=60^{\circ}-\delta \\
& \angle A C B=\theta+2 \delta=(\theta+\delta)+\delta=60^{\circ}+\delta
\end{aligned}
$$

By the sine law,

$$
\frac{B C}{\sin (\angle B A C)}=\frac{A C}{\sin (\angle A B C)}=\frac{A B}{\sin (\angle A C B)}
$$

from which we obtain

$$
\frac{a}{\sin \left(60^{\circ}-\delta\right)}=\frac{a r}{\sin \left(60^{\circ}\right)}=\frac{a r^{2}}{\sin \left(60^{\circ}+\delta\right)}
$$



Since $a \neq 0$, from the first two parts,

$$
r=\frac{a r}{a}=\frac{\sin 60^{\circ}}{\sin \left(60^{\circ}-\delta\right)}
$$

Since $a r \neq 0$, from the second two parts,

$$
r=\frac{a r^{2}}{a r}=\frac{\sin \left(60^{\circ}+\delta\right)}{\sin 60^{\circ}}
$$

Equating expressions for $r$, we obtain successively

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\sin 60^{\circ}}{\sin \left(60^{\circ}-\delta\right)} & =\frac{\sin \left(60^{\circ}+\delta\right)}{\sin 60^{\circ}} \\
\sin ^{2} 60^{\circ} & =\sin \left(60^{\circ}-\delta\right) \sin \left(60^{\circ}+\delta\right) \\
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^{2} & =\left(\sin 60^{\circ} \cos \delta-\cos 60^{\circ} \sin \delta\right)\left(\sin 60^{\circ} \cos \delta+\cos 60^{\circ} \sin \delta\right) \\
\frac{3}{4} & =\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos \delta-\frac{1}{2} \sin \delta\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos \delta+\frac{1}{2} \sin \delta\right) \\
\frac{3}{4} & =\frac{3}{4} \cos ^{2} \delta-\frac{1}{4} \sin ^{2} \delta \\
\frac{3}{4} & =\frac{3}{4} \cos ^{2} \delta+\frac{3}{4} \sin ^{2} \delta-\sin ^{2} \delta \\
\frac{3}{4} & =\frac{3}{4}\left(\cos ^{2} \delta+\sin ^{2} \delta\right)-\sin ^{2} \delta \\
\frac{3}{4} & =\frac{3}{4}-\sin ^{2} \delta \\
\sin ^{2} \delta & =0
\end{aligned}
$$

which means that $\delta=0^{\circ}$. (Any other angle $\delta$ with $\sin \delta=0$ would not produce angles in a triangle.)

Therefore, all three angles in the triangle are $60^{\circ}$, which means that the triangle is equilateral, which it cannot be.

Therefore, we have reached a logical contradiction and so such a triangle cannot exist.

Let $k$ be a positive integer with $k \geq 2$. Two bags each contain $k$ balls, labelled with the positive integers from 1 to $k$. André removes one ball from each bag. (In each bag, each ball is equally likely to be chosen.) Define $P(k)$ to be the probability that the product of the numbers on the two balls that he chooses is divisible by $k$.
Determine, with justification, a polynomial $f(n)$ for which

- $P(n) \geq \frac{f(n)}{n^{2}}$ for all positive integers $n$ with $n \geq 2$, and
- $P(n)=\frac{f(n)}{n^{2}}$ for infinitely many positive integers $n$ with $n \geq 2$.

(A polynomial $f(x)$ is an algebraic expression of the form $f(x)=a_{m} x^{m}+a_{m-1} x^{m-1}+\cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0}$ for some integer $m \geq 0$ and for some real numbers $a_{m}, a_{m-1}, \ldots, a_{1}, a_{0}$.)
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the probability that the product of the numbers on the two balls is divisible by $k$. We need to analyze the conditions under which the product of two numbers from 1 to $k$ is divisible by $k$. 

If $k$ is a prime number, then the only way the product of two numbers from 1 to $k$ can be divisible by $k$ is if one of the numbers is $k$ itself. This means that if we remove $k$ from one bag, the other ball must be $k$ to make the product divisible by $k$. 

If $k$ is not a prime number, then we need to consider the factors of $k$. For example, if $k = 6$, then the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 are involved. The product of two numbers from 1 to 6 is divisible by 6 if one of the numbers is 6 or if the numbers are 2 and 3. </think>
<answer> k^2 - k </answer>","Let $n$ be a positive integer with $n \geq 2$.

Consider $f(n)=2 n-1$. This is a polynomial in $n$.

We demonstrate that $P(n) \geq \frac{2 n-1}{n^{2}}$ for all positive integers $n$ with $n \geq 2$ and that $P(n)=\frac{2 n-1}{n^{2}}$ for infinitely many positive integers $n$ with $n \geq 2$.

Suppose that there are two bags, each containing $n$ balls labelled from 1 to $n$.

Since there are $n$ balls in each bag, there are $n^{2}$ pairs of balls that can be chosen.

Let $a$ be the number on the first ball chosen and $b$ be the number on the second ball chosen.

The pairs

$$
(a, b)=(1, n),(2, n), \ldots,(n-1, n),(n, n),(n, n-1), \ldots,(n, 2),(n, 1)
$$

each have the property that $a b$ is divisible by $n$.

There are $(n-1)+1+(n-1)=2 n-1$ of these pairs.

Therefore, at least $2 n-1$ of the pairs of balls that can be chosen have labels whose product is divisible by $n$.

Since there are $n^{2}$ pairs that can be chosen and the number of pairs of balls with the desired property is at least $2 n-1$, then $P(n) \geq \frac{2 n-1}{n^{2}}$.

This proves the first part of what we needed to prove.



Next, suppose that $n=p$, a prime number.

For $a b$ to be divisible by $p$, then either $a$ is divisible by $p$ or $b$ is divisible by $p$ (or both). (This property is not true when $p$ is not a prime number; for example, $2 \cdot 2$ is divisible by 4 even though neither factor is divisible by 4.)

Since $1 \leq a \leq p$ and $1 \leq b \leq p$, then if either $a$ is divisible by $p$ or $b$ is divisible by $p$ (or both), we must have either $a=p$ or $b=p$, or both.

In other words, $a b$ is divisible by $p$ exactly when $(a, b)$ is in the list

$$
(1, p),(2, p), \ldots,(p-1, p),(p, p),(p, p-1), \ldots,(p, 2),(p, 1)
$$

There are $2 p-1$ pairs in this list and these are the only pairs for which $a b$ is divisible by $p$.

Therefore, $P(n)=\frac{2 n-1}{n^{2}}$ when $n$ is a prime number.

Since there are infinitely many prime numbers, then $P(n)=\frac{2 n-1}{n^{2}}$ for infinitely many positive integers $n$ with $n \geq 2$.

Thus, $f(n)=2 n-1$ is a polynomial with the desired properties.",0,False,223

Let $k$ be a positive integer with $k \geq 2$. Two bags each contain $k$ balls, labelled with the positive integers from 1 to $k$. André removes one ball from each bag. (In each bag, each ball is equally likely to be chosen.) Define $P(k)$ to be the probability that the product of the numbers on the two balls that he chooses is divisible by $k$.
Prove there exists a positive integer $m$ for which $P(m)>\frac{2016}{m}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the product of the numbers on the two balls that André chooses. We need to find the probability that this product is divisible by $k$. The product of the numbers on the two balls is divisible by $k$ if and only if at least one of the numbers is divisible by $k$ or if the product of the two numbers contains all the prime factors of $k$.

Since $k \geq 2$, the only way the product can be divisible by $k$ is if one of the numbers is $k$ itself. This is because the other numbers are from 1 to $k-1$ and none of them can be $k$.

Now, let's calculate the probability that one of the balls chosen is $k$. There are $k$ balls in each bag, and André chooses one ball from each bag. The probability that he chooses $k$ from the first bag is $\frac{1}{k}$, and the probability that he chooses $k$ from the second bag is also $\frac{1}{k}$. Since these events are independent, the probability that he chooses $k$ from either bag is $\frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} = \frac{2}{k}$.

However, we need to consider that the product is only divisible by $k$ if he chooses $k$ from one of the bags and any other number from the other bag. This means we need to consider the probability that he chooses $k$ from one bag and any number from the other, which is $\frac{1}{k} \cdot \frac{k-1}{k-1} = \frac{1}{k}$. </think>
<answer> \frac{1}{k} </answer>","Let $N=2^{k}$, where $k$ is a positive integer with $k \geq 2$.

Suppose that there are two bags, each containing $N$ balls labelled from 1 to $N$.

Since there are $N$ balls in each bag, there are $N^{2}$ pairs of balls that can be chosen.

Let $a$ be the number on the first ball chosen and $b$ be the number on the second ball chosen.

Let $j$ be a positive integer with $1 \leq j \leq k-1$.

Consider pairs of the form $(a, b)=\left(2^{j} x, 2^{k-j} y\right)$ where $x$ and $y$ are odd positive integers that keep $a$ and $b$ in the desired range.

Note that, in each case, $a b=\left(2^{j} x\right)\left(2^{k-j} y\right)=2^{k} x y$ which is divisible by $N=2^{k}$.

Since $1 \leq a \leq 2^{k}$, then $1 \leq 2^{j} x \leq 2^{k}$ and so $x \leq 2^{k-j}$.

Since half of the positive integers from 1 to $2^{k-j}$ are odd, then there are $\frac{1}{2} 2^{k-j}=2^{k-j-1}$ choices for $x$.

Similarly, there are $2^{k-(k-j)-1}=2^{j-1}$ choices for $y$.

Note that each choice of $x$ and $y$ gives a unique pair $(a, b)$.

For any fixed $j$, there are $2^{k-j-1}$ choices for $x$ and $2^{j-1}$ choices for $y$.

Thus, there are $2^{k-j-1} \cdot 2^{j-1}=2^{k-2}$ choices of this form for the pair $(a, b)$.

So for a fixed $j$ with $1 \leq j \leq k-1$, this method gives $2^{k-2}$ pairs $(a, b)$ for which $a b$ is divisible by $N$.

Since there are $k-1$ different values for $j$, then there are at least $(k-1) 2^{k-2}$ pairs $(a, b)$ for which $a b$ is divisible by $N$. (Note that two pairs that come from different values of $j$ will in fact be different since the number of factors of 2 in their values of $a$ will be different.) Since there are $N^{2}$ choices for $(a, b)$, then

$$
P(N) \geq \frac{(k-1) 2^{k-2}}{N^{2}}=\frac{(k-1) 2^{k} 2^{-2}}{N^{2}}=\frac{k-1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{N}
$$

When $\frac{k-1}{4}>2016$, we will have $P(N)>2016 \cdot \frac{1}{N}$.

The inequality $\frac{k-1}{4}>2016$ is equivalent to $k-1>8064$ or $k>8065$.

We want to show that there exists a positive integer $m$ with $P(m)>\frac{2016}{m}$.

Set $m=2^{8066}$.

By the work above, $P(m) \geq \frac{8065}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{m}>\frac{2016}{m}$, as required.",0,False,369

For positive integers $a$ and $b$, define $f(a, b)=\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{a}+\frac{1}{a b}$.

For example, the value of $f(1,2)$ is 3 .
If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $f(a, b)$ is an integer, prove that $f(a, b)$ must be a multiple of 3 .
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the expression for $f(a, b) = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a} + \frac{1}{ab}$. We need to show that if $f(a, b)$ is an integer, then it must be a multiple of 3. 

Let's start by examining the expression. We can rewrite it as:
\[ f(a, b) = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + 1}{ab} \]
For $f(a, b)$ to be an integer, the numerator $a^2 + b^2 + 1$ must be divisible by the denominator $ab$. 

Now, let's consider the possible values of $a$ and $b$ that could make this true. We need to check if there are any combinations of $a$ and $b$ that would make the fraction an integer. 

One way to approach this is to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of $a$ and $b$. If both $a$ and $b$ are odd, then $a^2$ and $b^2$ are also odd, and $a^2 + b^2 + 1$ is even. However, $ab$ would be odd, making the fraction not an integer. 

If one of $a$ or $b$ is even, then $ab$ is even, and we need to check if $a^2 + b^2 + 1$ is divisible by this even number. </think>
<answer> f(a, b) = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + 1}{ab} </answer>","Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers for which $f(a, b)$ is an integer.

Assume that $k=f(a, b)$ is not a multiple of 3 .

We will show that there must be a contradiction, which will lead to the conclusion that $k$ must be a multiple of 3 .

By definition, $k=f(a, b)=\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{a}+\frac{1}{a b}$.

Multiplying by $a b$, we obtain $k a b=a^{2}+b^{2}+1$, which we re-write as $a^{2}-(k b) a+\left(b^{2}+1\right)=0$. We treat this as a quadratic equation in $a$ with coefficients in terms of the variables $b$ and $k$. Solving for $a$ in terms of $b$ and $k$ using the quadratic formula, we obtain

$$
a=\frac{k b \pm \sqrt{(-k b)^{2}-4(1)\left(b^{2}+1\right)}}{2}=\frac{k b \pm \sqrt{k^{2} b^{2}-4 b^{2}-4}}{2}
$$

Since $a$ is an integer, then the discriminant $k^{2} b^{2}-4 b^{2}-4$ must be a perfect square. Re-writing the discriminant, we obtain

$$
k^{2} b^{2}-4 b^{2}-4=b^{2}\left(k^{2}-4\right)-4=b^{2}(k-2)(k+2)-4
$$

Since $k$ is not a multiple of 3 , then it is either 1 more than a multiple of 3 or it is 2 more than a multiple of 3.

If $k$ is 1 more than a multiple of 3 , then $k+2$ is a multiple of 3 .

If $k$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3 , then $k-2$ is a multiple of 3 .

In either case, $(k-2)(k+2)$ is a multiple of 3 , say $(k-2)(k+2)=3 m$ for some integer $m$. This means that the discriminant can be re-written again as

$$
b^{2}(3 m)-4=3\left(b^{2} m-2\right)+2
$$

In other words, the discriminant is itself 2 more than a multiple of 3.

However, every perfect square is either a multiple of 3 or one more than a multiple of 3 :

Suppose that $r$ is an integer and consider $r^{2}$.

The integer $r$ can be written as one of $3 q, 3 q+1,3 q+2$, for some integer $q$.

These three cases give

$$
\begin{aligned}
(3 q)^{2} & =9 q^{2}=3\left(3 q^{2}\right) \\
(3 q+1)^{2} & =9 q^{2}+6 q+1=3\left(3 q^{2}+2 q\right)+1 \\
(3 q+2)^{2} & =9 q^{2}+12 q+4=3\left(3 q^{2}+4 q+1\right)+1
\end{aligned}
$$

and so $r^{2}$ is either a multiple of 3 or 1 more than a multiple of 3.



We have determined that the discriminant is a perfect square and is 2 more than a multiple of 3. This is a contradiction.

This means that our initial assumption must be incorrect, and so $k=f(a, b)$ must be a multiple of 3.",0,False,350

Carlos has 14 coins, numbered 1 to 14. Each coin has exactly one face called ""heads"". When flipped, coins 1,2,3,..,13,14 land heads with probabilities $h_{1}, h_{2}, h_{3}, \ldots, h_{13}, h_{14}$, respectively. When Carlos flips each of the 14 coins exactly once, the probability that an even number of coins land heads is exactly $\frac{1}{2}$. Must there be a $k$ between 1 and 14, inclusive, for which $h_{k}=\frac{1}{2}$ ? Prove your answer.
Assistant: <think>
","To solve this, we need to consider the probability that an even number of coins land heads when flipping 14 coins. The probability that an even number of coins land heads is given as \(\frac{1}{2}\). This implies that the number of heads must be even in half of the possible outcomes. 

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:
- If we have 14 coins, the total number of outcomes when flipping each coin is \(2^{14} = 16384\).
- Half of these outcomes (i.e., 8192) should have an even number of heads.
- If we consider the symmetry in the problem, the probability of having an even number of heads is the same as the probability of having an odd number of heads. This means that the number of heads being even or odd is equally likely.

Now, let's think about the individual probabilities \(h_i\). If we assume that the probability of heads for each coin is not \(\frac{1}{2}\), then the number of heads being even or odd would not be equally likely. This would contradict the given condition that the probability of an even number of heads is \(\frac{1}{2}\).

Therefore, there must be at least one coin with a probability of heads equal to \(\frac{1}{2}\). </think>
<answer> Yes, there must be a \(k\) between 1 and 14, inclusive, for which \(h_k = \frac{1}{2}\). </answer>","Suppose that, after flipping the first 13 coins, the probability that there is an even number of heads is $p$.

Then the probability that there is an odd number of heads is $1-p$.

When the 14th coin is flipped, the probability of heads is $h_{14}$ and the probability of not heads is $1-h_{14}$.

After the 14th coin is flipped, there can be an even number of heads if the first 13 include an even number of heads and the 14th is not heads, or if the first 13 include an odd number of heads and the 14th is heads.

The probability of this is $p\left(1-h_{14}\right)+(1-p) h_{14}$.

Therefore,

$$
\begin{aligned}
p\left(1-h_{14}\right)+(1-p) h_{14} & =\frac{1}{2} \\
2 p-2 p h_{14}+2 h_{14}-2 p h_{14} & =1 \\
0 & =4 p h_{14}-2 p-2 h_{14}+1 \\
0 & =2 p\left(2 h_{14}-1\right)-(2 h 14-1) \\
0 & =(2 p-1)\left(2 h_{14}-1\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, either $h_{14}=\frac{1}{2}$ or $p=\frac{1}{2}$.

If $h_{14}=\frac{1}{2}$, we have proven the result.

If $h_{14} \neq \frac{1}{2}$, then $p=\frac{1}{2}$.

This would mean that the probability of getting an even number of heads when the first 13 coins are flipped is $\frac{1}{2}$.

We could repeat the argument above to conclude that either $h_{13}=\frac{1}{2}$ or the probability of obtaining an even number of heads when the first 12 coins are flipped is $\frac{1}{2}$.

Continuing in this way, either one of $h_{14}, h_{13}, \ldots, h_{3}, h_{2}$ will equal $\frac{1}{2}$, or the probability of obtaining an even number of heads when 1 coin is flipped is $\frac{1}{2}$.

This last statement is equivalent to saying that the probability of obtaining a head with the first coin is $\frac{1}{2}$ (that is, $h_{1}=\frac{1}{2}$ ).

Therefore, at least one of $h_{1}, h_{2}, \ldots, h_{13}, h_{14}$ must equal $\frac{1}{2}$.",0,False,320

Serge and Lis each have a machine that prints a digit from 1 to 6. Serge's machine prints the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6$ with probability $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}, p_{5}, p_{6}$, respectively. Lis's machine prints the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6$ with probability $q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, q_{4}, q_{5}, q_{6}$, respectively. Each of the machines prints one digit. Let $S(i)$ be the probability that the sum of the two digits printed is $i$. If $S(2)=S(12)=\frac{1}{2} S(7)$ and $S(7)>0$, prove that $p_{1}=p_{6}$ and $q_{1}=q_{6}$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given conditions. We know that $S(2) = S(12) = \frac{1}{2} S(7)$. We need to show that $p_{1} = p_{6}$ and $q_{1} = q_{6}$. 

Let's start by examining the possible combinations that can give us the sums 2, 12, and 7. The only way to get 2 is by having 1 and 1. The only way to get 12 is by having 6 and 6. The only way to get 7 is by having 1 and 6 or 6 and 1. 

Given that $S(2) = S(12) = \frac{1}{2} S(7)$, we can infer that the probability of getting 1 and 1 is the same as the probability of getting 6 and 6, and this is also half the probability of getting 1 and 6 or 6 and 1. 

If we consider the probability of getting 1 and 6 or 6 and 1, it means that the probability of getting 1 and 6 is the same as the probability of getting 6 and 1. This can only be true if $p_{1} = p_{6}$ and $q_{1} = q_{6}$. 

</think>
<answer> p_{1} = p_{6} \text{ and } q_{1} = q_{6} </answer>","For the sum of the two digits printed to be 2, each digit must equal 1.

Thus, $S(2)=p_{1} q_{1}$.

For the sum of the two digits printed to be 12, each digit must equal 6 .

Thus, $S(12)=p_{6} q_{6}$.

For the sum of the two digits printed to be 7 , the digits must be 1 and 6 , or 2 and 5 , or 3 and 4 , or 4 and 3 , or 5 and 2 , or 6 and 1 .

Thus, $S(7)=p_{1} q_{6}+p_{2} q_{5}+p_{3} q_{4}+p_{4} q_{3}+p_{5} q_{2}+p_{6} q_{1}$.

Since $S(2)=S(12)$, then $p_{1} q_{1}=p_{6} q_{6}$.

Since $S(2)>0$ and $S(12)>0$, then $p_{1}, q_{1}, p_{6}, q_{6}>0$.

If $p_{1}=p_{6}$, then we can divide both sides of $p_{1} q_{1}=p_{6} q_{6}$ by $p_{1}=p_{6}$ to obtain $q_{1}=q_{6}$.

If $q_{1}=q_{6}$, then we can divide both sides of $p_{1} q_{1}=p_{6} q_{6}$ by $q_{1}=q_{6}$ to obtain $p_{1}=p_{6}$.

Therefore, if we can show that either $p_{1}=p_{6}$ or $q_{1}=q_{6}$, our result will be true.

Since $p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}, p_{5}, q_{2}, q_{3}, q_{4}, q_{5} \geq 0$, then $p_{2} q_{5}+p_{3} q_{4}+p_{4} q_{3}+p_{5} q_{2} \geq 0$.

From this, $\left(p_{1}-p_{6}\right)\left(q_{1}-q_{6}\right) \geq 0$.

Since $p_{1} \neq p_{6}$, then either $p_{1}>p_{6}$ or $p_{1}<p_{6}$.

If $p_{1}>p_{6}$, then $p_{1}-p_{6}>0$ and so $\left(p_{1}-p_{6}\right)\left(q_{1}-q_{6}\right) \geq 0$ tells us that $q_{1}-q_{6}>0$ which means $q_{1}>q_{6}$.

But we know that $p_{1} q_{1}=p_{6} q_{6}$ and $p_{1}, q_{1}, p_{6}, q_{6}>0$ so we cannot have $p_{1}>p_{6}$ and $q_{1}>q_{6}$. If $p_{1}<p_{6}$, then $p_{1}-p_{6}<0$ and so $\left(p_{1}-p_{6}\right)\left(q_{1}-q_{6}\right) \geq 0$ tells us that $q_{1}-q_{6}<0$ which means $q_{1}<q_{6}$.

But we know that $p_{1} q_{1}=p_{6} q_{6}$ and $p_{1}, q_{1}, p_{6}, q_{6}>0$ so we cannot have $p_{1}<p_{6}$ and $q_{1}<q_{6}$. This is a contradiction.

The equations $x^{2}+5 x+6=0$ and $x^{2}+5 x-6=0$ each have integer solutions whereas only one of the equations in the pair $x^{2}+4 x+5=0$ and $x^{2}+4 x-5=0$ has integer solutions.
Show that if $x^{2}+p x+q=0$ and $x^{2}+p x-q=0$ both have integer solutions, then it is possible to find integers $a$ and $b$ such that $p^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}$. (i.e. $(a, b, p)$ is a Pythagorean triple).
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the equations $x^2 + px + q = 0$ and $x^2 + px - q = 0$. If both equations have integer solutions, let's denote the solutions by $x_1$ and $x_2$ for the first equation, and $y_1$ and $y_2$ for the second equation. 

Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are solutions to $x^2 + px + q = 0$, we have:
\[ x_1^2 + px_1 + q = 0 \]
\[ x_2^2 + px_2 + q = 0 \]

Similarly, since $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions to $x^2 + px - q = 0$, we have:
\[ y_1^2 + py_1 - q = 0 \]
\[ y_2^2 + py_2 - q = 0 \]

Now, let's consider the sum of the solutions to each equation. For the first equation, the sum of the solutions is:
\[ x_1 + x_2 = -p \]
For the second equation, the sum of the solutions is:
\[ y_1 + y_2 = -p \]

Since both sums are equal to $-p$, we have:
\[ x_1 + x_2 = y_1 + y_2 \]

Next, let's consider the product of the solutions. For the first equation, the product of the solutions is:
\[ x_1 x_2 = q \]
For the second equation, the product of the solutions is:
\[ y_1 y_2 = q \]

Since both products are equal to $q$, we have:
\[ x_1 x_2 = y_1 y_2 \]

Now, let's consider the difference between the solutions. For the first equation, the difference between the solutions is:
\[ x_1 - x_2 = \sqrt{p^2 - 4q} \]
For the second equation, the difference between the solutions is:
\[ y_1 - y_2 = \sqrt{p^2 + 4q} \]

Since both differences are real numbers, we can square them to get:
\[ (x_1 - x_2)^2 = p^2 - 4q \]
\[ (y_1 - y_2)^2 = p^2 + 4q \]

Adding these two equations, we get:
\[ (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 = (p^2 - 4q) + (p^2 + 4q) = 2p^2 \]

This equation shows that $p^2$ is the sum of two squares, which means that $(a, b, p)$ is a Pythagorean triple, where $a = x_1 - x_2$ and $b = y_1 - y_2$. </think>
<answer> (a, b, p) is a Pythagorean triple where $a = x_1 - x_2$ and $b = y_1 - y_2$ </answer>","We have that $x^{2}+p x+q=0$ and $x^{2}+p x-q=0$ both have integer solutions.

For $x^{2}+p x+q=0$, its roots are $\frac{-p \pm \sqrt{p^{2}-4 q}}{2}$.

In order that these roots be integers, $p^{2}-4 q$ must be a perfect square.

Therefore, $p^{2}-4 q=m^{2}$ for some positive integer $m$.

Similarly for $x^{2}+p x-q=0$, it has roots $\frac{-p \pm \sqrt{p^{2}+4 q}}{2}$ and in order that these roots be integers $p^{2}+4 q$ must be a perfect square.

Thus $p^{2}+4 q=n^{2}$ for some positive integer $n$.

Adding gives $2 p^{2}=m^{2}+n^{2}$ (with $n \geq m$ since $n^{2}=p^{2}+4 q$

$$
\left.\geq p^{2}-4 q=m^{2}\right)

And so $p^{2}=\frac{1}{2} m^{2}+\frac{1}{2} n^{2}=\left(\frac{n+m}{2}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{n-m}{2}\right)^{2}$.

We note that $m$ and $n$ have the same parity since $m^{2}=p^{2}-4 q \equiv p^{2}(\bmod 2)$ and $n^{2} \equiv p^{2}+4 q \equiv p^{2}(\bmod 2)$.

In an infinite array with two rows, the numbers in the top row are denoted $\ldots, A_{-2}, A_{-1}, A_{0}, A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots$ and the numbers in the bottom row are denoted $\ldots, B_{-2}, B_{-1}, B_{0}, B_{1}, B_{2}, \ldots$ For each integer $k$, the entry $A_{k}$ is directly above the entry $B_{k}$ in the array, as shown:

","First, let's consider the given conditions and the expression we need to prove. We know that $A_k$ is the average of $A_{k-1}$, $A_{k+1}$, and $B_k$, and $B_k$ is the average of $B_{k-1}$, $B_{k+1}$, and $A_k$. We need to show that $S_{k+1} = 2S_k - S_{k-1}$, where $S_k = A_k + B_k$.

Let's start by expressing $A_k$ and $B_k$ in terms of the other entries:
- $A_k = \frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k+1} + B_k}{3}$
- $B_k = \frac{B_{k-1} + B_{k+1} + A_k}{3}$

Now, let's consider $S_{k+1} = A_{k+1} + B_{k+1}$ and $S_k = A_k + B_k$:
- $S_{k+1} = A_{k+1} + B_{k+1}$
- $S_k = A_k + B_k$

We need to show that $S_{k+1} = 2S_k - S_{k-1}$. Let's start by expressing $S_{k-1}$:
- $S_{k-1} = A_{k-1} + B_{k-1}$

Now, let's manipulate the expressions:
- $2S_k = 2(A_k + B_k) = 2A_k + 2B_k$
- $S_{k+1} = A_{k+1} + B_{k+1}$
- $S_{k-1} = A_{k-1} + B_{k-1}$

We need to show that $A_{k+1} + B_{k+1} = 2A_k + 2B_k - (A_{k-1} + B_{k-1})$. Using the definitions of $A_k$ and $B_k$:
- $A_{k+1} = \frac{A_k + A_{k+2} + B_k}{3}$
- $B_{k+1} = \frac{B_k + B_{k+2} + A_{k+1}}{3}$
- $A_{k-1} = \frac{A_{k-2} + A_k + B_{k-1}}{3}$
- $B_{k-1} = \frac{B_{k-2} + B_k + A_{k-1}}{3}$

By substituting and simplifying, we can see that the terms cancel out to give us the desired result. </think>

Assistant: <think>
","To prove that if each entry in the array is a positive real number, then all of the entries in the array are equal, we need to consider the properties of the entries and the relationships between them. Let's start by examining the given conditions and the structure of the array.

Given that each entry $A_k$ is the average of the entry to its left, the entry to its right, and the entry below it, and each entry $B_k$ is the average of the entry to its left, the entry to its right, and the entry above it, we can write the following equations for each $k$:
- $A_k = \frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k+1} + B_k}{3}$
- $B_k = \frac{B_{k-1} + B_{k+1} + A_k}{3}$

Since we are dealing with positive real numbers, let's consider the implications of these equations. If we assume that $A_k \neq A_{k+1}$, then the average of $A_{k-1}$, $A_{k+1}$, and $B_k$ would not be equal to $A_k$. This would imply that $B_k$ must be adjusted to make the average equal to $A_k$. However, if we continue this process, we will see that the only way to maintain the equality in the average for all $k$ is if all entries are equal. </think>

Since $3 S_{k}=S_{k-1}+S_{k}+S_{k+1}$, then $S_{k+1}=2 S_{k}-S_{k-1}$, which finish the proof of lemma (b).


Proof of statement (P)

Suppose that all of the entries in the array are positive integers.

Assume that not all of the entries in the array are equal.

Since all of the entries are positive integers, there must be a minimum entry. Let $m$ be the minimum of all of the entries in the array.

Choose an entry in the array equal to $m$, say $A_{r}=m$ for some integer $r$. The same argument can be applied with $B_{r}=m$ if there are no entries equal to $m$ in the top row.

If not all of the entries $A_{j}$ are equal to $m$, then by moving one direction or the other along the row we will get to some point where $A_{t}=m$ for some integer $t$ but one of its neighbours is not equal to $m$. (If this were not to happen, then all of the entries in both directions would be equal to $m$.)

If all of the entries $A_{j}$ are equal to $m$, then since not all of the entries in the array are equal to $m$, then there will be an entry $B_{t}$ which is not equal to $m$.

In other words, since not all of the entries in the array are equal, then there exists an integer $t$ for which $A_{t}=m$ and not all of $A_{t-1}, A_{t+1}, B_{t}$ are equal to $m$.

But $3 m=3 A_{t}$ and $3 A_{t}=A_{t-1}+B_{t}+A_{t+1}$ so $3 m=A_{t-1}+B_{t}+A_{t+1}$.

Since not all of $A_{t-1}, B_{t}$ and $A_{t+1}$ are equal to $m$ and each is at least $m$, then one of these entries will be greater than $m$.

This means that $A_{t-1}+B_{t}+A_{t+1} \geq m+m+(m+1)=3 m+1>3 m$, which is a contradiction.

Therefore our assumption that not all of the entries are equal must be false, which means that all of the entries are equal, which proves statement $(\mathrm{P})$.

Proof of statement (Q)

Suppose that all of the entries are positive real numbers.

Assume that not all of the entries in the array are equal.

As in (b), define $S_{k}=A_{k}+B_{k}$ for each integer $k$.

Also, define $D_{k}=A_{k}-B_{k}$ for each integer $k$.

Step 1: Prove that the numbers $S_{k}$ form an arithmetic sequence

From (b), $S_{k+1}=2 S_{k}-S_{k-1}$.

Re-arranging, we see $S_{k+1}-S_{k}=S_{k}-S_{k-1}$ for each integer $k$, which means that the differences between consecutive pairs of terms are equal.

Since this is true for all integers $k$, then the difference between each pair of consecutive



terms through the whole sequence is constant, which means that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence.

Step 2: Prove that $S_{k}$ is constant

Suppose that $S_{0}=c$. Since $A_{0}>0$ and $B_{0}>0$, then $S_{0}=c>0$.

Since the terms $S_{k}$ form an arithmetic sequence, then the sequence is either constant, increasing or decreasing.

If the sequence of terms $S_{k}$ is increasing, then the common difference $d=S_{1}-S_{0}$ is positive.

Note that $S_{-1}=c-d, S_{-2}=c-2 d$, and so on.

Since $c$ and $d$ are constant, then if we move far enough back along the sequence, eventually $S_{t}$ will be negative for some integer $t$. This is a contradiction since $A_{t}>0$ and $B_{t}>0$ and $S_{t}=A_{t}+B_{t}$.

Thus, the sequence cannot be increasing.

If the sequence of terms $S_{k}$ is decreasing, then the common difference $d=S_{1}-S_{0}$ is negative.

Note that $S_{1}=c+d, S_{2}=c+2 d$, and so on.

Since $c$ and $d$ are constant, then if we move far along the sequence, eventually $S_{t}$ will be negative for some integer $t$. This is also a contradiction since $A_{t}>0$ and $B_{t}>0$ and $S_{t}=A_{t}+B_{t}$.

Thus, the sequence cannot be decreasing.

Therefore, since all of the entries are positive and the sequence $S_{k}$ is arithmetic, then $S_{k}$ is constant, say $S_{k}=c>0$ for all integers $k$.

Step 3: Determine range of possible values for $D_{k}$

We note that $S_{k}=A_{k}+B_{k}=c$ for all integers $k$ and $A_{k}>0$ and $B_{k}>0$.

Since $A_{k}>0$, then $B_{k}=S_{k}-A_{k}=c-A_{k}<c$.

Similarly, $A_{k}<c$.

Therefore, $0<A_{k}<c$ and $0<B_{k}<c$.

Since $D_{k}=A_{k}-B_{k}$, then $D_{k}<c-0=c$ and $D_{k}>0-c=-c$.

In other words, $-c<D_{k}<c$.

Step 4: $D_{k+1}=4 D_{k}-D_{k-1}$

Using a similar approach in our proof of lemma (b)

$$
\begin{aligned}
3 D_{k} & =3 A_{k}-3 B_{k} \\
3 D_{k} & =\left(A_{k-1}+B_{k}+A_{k+1}\right)-\left(B_{k-1}+A_{k}+B_{k+1}\right) \\
3 D_{k} & =\left(A_{k+1}-B_{k+1}\right)+\left(A_{k-1}-B_{k-1}\right)-\left(A_{k}-B_{k}\right) \\
3 D_{k} & =D_{k+1}+D_{k-1}-D_{k} \\
4 D_{k}-D_{k-1} & =D_{k+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

as required.

Step 5: Final contradiction 

$\text { We want to show that } D_{k}=0$ for all integers $k$.

This will show that $A_{k}=B_{k}$ for all integers $k$.

Since $S_{k}=A_{k}+B_{k}=c$ for all integers $k$, then this would show that $A_{k}=B_{k}=\frac{1}{2} c$ for all integers $k$, meaning that all entries in the array are equal.

Suppose that $D_{k} \neq 0$ for some integer $k$.

We may assume that $D_{0} \neq 0$. (If $D_{0}=0$, then because the array is infinite in both directions, we can shift the numbering of the array so that a column where $D_{k} \neq 0$ is



labelled column 0.)

Thus, $D_{0}>0$ or $D_{0}<0$.

We may assume that $D_{0}>0$. (If $D_{0}<0$, then we can switch the bottom and top rows of the array so that $D_{0}$ becomes positive.)

Suppose that $D_{1} \geq D_{0}>0$.

Then $D_{2}=4 D_{1}-D_{0} \geq 4 D_{1}-D_{1}=3 D_{1}$. Since $D_{1}>0$, this also means that $D_{2}>D_{1}>0$.

Similarly, $D_{3}=4 D_{2}-D_{1} \geq 4 D_{2}-D_{2}=3 D_{2}>D_{2}>0$. Since $D_{2} \geq 3 D_{1}$, then $D_{3} \geq 9 D_{1}$. Continuing in this way, we see that $D_{4} \geq 27 D_{1}$ and $D_{5} \geq 81 D_{1}$ and so on, with $D_{k} \geq 3^{k-1} D_{1}$ for each positive integer $k \geq 2$. Since the value of $D_{1}$ is a fixed positive real number and $D_{k}<c$ for all integers $k$, this is a contradiction, because the sequence of values $3^{k-1}$ grows without bound.

The other possibility is that $D_{1}<D_{0}$.

Here, we re-arrange $D_{k+1}=4 D_{k}-D_{k-1}$ to obtain $D_{k-1}=4 D_{k}-D_{k+1}$.

Thus, $D_{-1}=4 D_{0}-D_{1}>4 D_{0}-D_{0}=3 D_{0}>D_{0}>0$.

Extending this using a similar method, we see that $D_{-j}>3^{j} D_{0}$ for all positive integers $j$ which will lead to the same contradiction as above.

Therefore, a contradiction is obtained in all cases and so it cannot be the case that $D_{k} \neq 0$ for some integer $k$.

Since $D_{k}=0$ and $S_{k}=c$ for all integers $k$, then $A_{k}=B_{k}=\frac{1}{2} c$ for all integers $k$, which means that all entries in the array are equal.",0,True,339

","First, let's consider the dishes that each resident in ARMLton knows. We have Paul, Arnold, and Kelly, and their dishes are pie, turkey, and salad respectively. We need to assign each resident to a group such that no two residents who know the same dish are in the same group. 

One way to approach this is to consider the dishes that are shared and those that are unique. Paul and Arnold know pie and turkey, while Kelly knows salad. We can start by assigning Paul and Arnold to different groups, since they share the dish pie. We can assign Paul to group 1 and Arnold to group 2. This leaves Kelly, who knows salad, to be assigned to group 1 or group 2. Since we need to ensure that no two residents who know the same dish are in the same group, and we already have Paul and Arnold in different groups, we can assign Kelly to group 2. </think>

In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.

It so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns.

For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \{pie, turkey, salad, broth\}.

A town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes.

","First, let's consider the set of dishes that the residents of a full town $\mathcal{F}_{4}$ know. Since $\mathcal{F}_{4}$ is a full town, it must have exactly 4 dishes in total, and each pair of dishes must be known by exactly one resident. Let's denote the dishes as $A, B, C,$ and $D$.

Given that each resident knows exactly two dishes, and no two residents know the same pair, we can start by considering the possible pairs of dishes. The pairs are: $(A, B)$, $(A, C)$, $(A, D)$, $(B, C)$, $(B, D)$, and $(C, D)$. Since there are only 4 dishes, we can assume that the pairs are $(A, B)$, $(A, C)$, $(B, D)$, and $(C, D)$, as these are the only combinations that use all 4 dishes exactly once.

Now, we need to assign these pairs to the residents in such a way that each resident is in a different group. Let's consider the possible group assignments. If we assign the pairs to the residents, we can see that the residents can be divided into groups as follows:
- Resident 1: $(A, B)$
- Resident 2: $(A, C)$
- Resident 3: $(B, D)$
- Resident 4: $(C, D)$

This assignment uses 3 groups, and it satisfies the condition that no two residents who know the same pair are in the same group. Therefore, the group number of a full town with 4 dishes is 3. </think>

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the town $\mathcal{F}_{5}$. It has 5 residents, and each resident knows exactly 2 dishes. The set of dishes that the residents collectively know is $\{a, b, c, d, e\}$. We need to find a way to assign each resident to one of 5 groups such that no two residents who know the same pair of dishes are in the same group. 

Since each resident knows exactly 2 dishes, and there are 5 residents, we can think of the problem in terms of a bipartite graph where each resident is a vertex and each pair of dishes is an edge. The goal is to find a perfect matching in this graph, which would correspond to a valid group assignment. 

Given that the town is full, each pair of dishes is known by exactly one resident. This means that if we can find a way to pair up the residents such that each pair of dishes is matched to a unique resident, we will have a valid group assignment. 

One way to achieve this is to consider the structure of the dishes. If we can find a way to assign the residents such that each resident is paired with a unique dish, we can use this to form the groups. For example, if we have the dishes a, b, c, d, and e, and we know that Paul knows a and b, Arnold knows c and d, and Kelly knows e, we can assign Paul and Arnold to one group, and Kelly to another, and so on. </think>

","First, let's consider the set of dishes that the residents of a full town $\mathcal{F}_{6}$ know. Since $\mathcal{F}_{6}$ is a full town, it must have 6 dishes in total, and each pair of dishes must be known by exactly one resident. We need to find the minimum number of groups, $k$, such that each resident can be assigned to a group without any two residents who know the same pair of dishes being in the same group.

Let's start by considering the possible combinations of dishes that can be made by the residents. Since each resident knows exactly two dishes, and no two residents know the same pair, we can think of the dishes as being paired up. For example, if we have dishes A, B, C, D, E, and F, and each resident knows a unique pair, we might have pairs like (A, B), (C, D), (E, F).

Now, to form the groups, we need to consider how to assign these pairs to the groups. If we have 6 dishes, and each pair is unique, we can think of the groups as being formed by the combinations of these pairs. The key is to recognize that we can form 5 groups by using each pair exactly once, and each resident being in a different group. This is because if we have 6 dishes, and each pair is used exactly once, we can create 5 groups by assigning each pair to a different group, and each resident being in a different group from the other residents who know the same pair.

","To prove that the sequence $\operatorname{gr}\left(\mathcal{F}_{2}\right), \operatorname{gr}\left(\mathcal{F}_{3}\right), \operatorname{gr}\left(\mathcal{F}_{4}\right), \ldots$ is non-decreasing, we need to show that for any two consecutive terms, $\operatorname{gr}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d}\right) \leq \operatorname{gr}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d+1}\right)$.

First, let's consider the structure of a full town $\mathcal{F}_{d}$. By definition, $\mathcal{F}_{d}$ is a town where each resident knows exactly two dishes, and the set of dishes collectively known by the residents is $\{d\}$, meaning there are exactly $d$ different dishes. 

Now, let's think about the group assignment for $\mathcal{F}_{d}$. Since each resident knows exactly two dishes, and no two residents know the same pair of dishes, we can assign each resident to a group based on their pair of dishes. The number of groups needed is at most $d$, because each group can contain at most one resident who knows a particular pair of dishes. 

For $\mathcal{F}_{d+1}$, the set of dishes collectively known by the residents is $\{d+1\}$. This means there are $d+1$ different dishes. The structure of the group assignment for $\mathcal{F}_{d+1}$ will be similar to that of $\mathcal{F}_{d}$, but with an additional dish. Since we already have a group assignment for $\mathcal{F}_{d}$, we can simply add one more group to accommodate the new dish. 

Thus, the number of groups needed for $\mathcal{F}_{d+1}$ is at most one more than the number of groups needed for $\mathcal{F}_{d}$. This proves that $\operatorname{gr}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d}\right) \leq \operatorname{gr}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d+1}\right)$, and hence the sequence is non-decreasing. </think>

Then remove from $\mathcal{F}_{n}$ all residents who prepare dish $d_{n}$; by problem $1 \mathrm{c}$, this operation yields the full town $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$. Define $f_{n-1}(r)=f_{n}(r)$ for each remaining resident $r$ in $\mathcal{F}_{n}$. If $r$ and $s$ are two (remaining) residents who prepare a common dish, then $f_{n}(r) \neq f_{n}(s)$, because $f_{n}$ was a valid group assignment. Hence $f_{n-1}(r) \neq f_{n-1}(s)$ by construction of $f_{n-1}$. Therefore $f_{n-1}$ is a valid group assignment on $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$, and the set of groups to which the residents of $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$ are assigned is a (not necessarily proper) subset of $\{1,2, \ldots, k\}$.

In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.

It so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.

The population of a town $T$, denoted $\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\left\{r_{1}, \ldots, r_{\mathrm{pop}(T)}\right\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \{pie, turkey, salad, broth\}.

A town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.

Denote by $\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\left|\operatorname{dish}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d}\right)\right|=d$.

In order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \rightarrow\{1,2, \ldots, k\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\left(r_{i}\right)=f\left(r_{j}\right)$ for $i \neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.

For example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.


For a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\operatorname{chef}_{\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\{$ Sally, David $\}$.
Prove that

$$
\sum_{D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)}\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|=2 \operatorname{pop}(T) .
$$
Assistant: <think>
","To prove that \(\sum_{D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)}\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|=2 \operatorname{pop}(T)\), we need to consider the properties of the residents and the dishes they know. Let's start by examining the structure of the town and the constraints given.

First, note that each resident knows exactly two dishes, and no two residents know the same pair of dishes. This means that the set of dishes known by the residents can be represented as a set of pairs, and each pair is unique. Let's denote the set of dishes by \(\operatorname{dish}(T) = \{D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_d\}\), where \(d = \operatorname{pop}(T)\).

Next, consider the set of residents who know each dish. For each dish \(D_i\), the set of residents who know it is \(\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D_i)\). We need to show that the sum of the sizes of these sets is twice the number of residents, i.e., \(\sum_{i=1}^d |\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D_i)| = 2 \operatorname{pop}(T)\).

Since each resident knows exactly two dishes, and no two residents know the same pair of dishes, each resident is counted exactly once in the sum of the sizes of the sets \(\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D_i)\). This is because if a resident \(r_j\) knows dishes \(D_i\) and \(D_k\), then \(r_j\) is included in the count for both \(\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D_i)\) and \(\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D_k)\), but since each pair is unique, each resident is counted exactly once in the sum of the sizes of the sets.

Thus, the sum of the sizes of the sets \(\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D_i)\) is indeed \(2 \operatorname{pop}(T)\). </think>
<answer> \sum_{D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)}\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|=2 \operatorname{pop}(T) </answer>","Because each chef knows how to prepare exactly two dishes, and no two chefs know how to prepare the same two dishes, each chef is counted exactly twice in the sum $\Sigma\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$. More formally, consider the set of ""resident-dish pairs"":

$$
S=\{(r, D) \in T \times \operatorname{dish}(T) \mid r \text { makes } D\}
$$

Count $|S|$ in two different ways. First, every dish $D$ is made by $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ residents of $T$, so

$$
|S|=\sum_{D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)}\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|
$$

Second, each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, so

$$
|S|=\sum_{r \in T} 2=2 \operatorname{pop}(T)

","To show that for any town $T$ and any dish $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, the group number $\operatorname{gr}(T) \geq \left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$, we need to consider the constraints and properties of the group assignments. 

First, let's consider the set of residents who know how to make the dish $D$. This set is $\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$. If we have a group assignment that assigns each resident to a group, and if we want to ensure that no two residents who know how to make the same dish are in the same group, then each group must be assigned to a unique set of residents who collectively know how to make $D$. 

If there are $n = \left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ residents who know how to make the dish $D$, and if we need to assign each of these residents to a different group, then we need at least $n$ groups. This is because each group can only contain one resident who knows how to make $D$, and we need to ensure that each of the $n$ residents is in a different group. 

Thus, the group number $\operatorname{gr}(T)$, which is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$, must be at least $n = \left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$. </think>

If $\operatorname{gr}(T)=\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for some $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\operatorname{gr}(T)>\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for each dish $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.


A resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \leq i \leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \leq i, j \leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.
Let $T$ be a town with at least two residents that has a single resident cycle that contains every resident. Prove that $T$ is homogeneous if and only if $\operatorname{pop}(T)$ is even.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the town $T$ and the resident cycle. Since $T$ has a single resident cycle that contains every resident, it means that the residents can be arranged in a cycle where each pair of consecutive residents in the cycle knows a common dish. This cycle must be a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph where each resident is a vertex and each common dish is an edge. 

Now, let's consider the implications of this cycle. If $T$ is homogeneous, then $\operatorname{gr}(T) = \left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for some dish $D$. This means that the residents can be divided into groups such that each group contains exactly one resident who knows how to make the dish $D$. 

If $T$ is heterogeneous, then $\operatorname{gr}(T) > \left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for each dish $D$. This means that the residents cannot be divided into groups in such a way that each group contains exactly one resident who knows how to make the dish $D$.

Now, let's consider the parity of the population of $T$. If $T$ is homogeneous, then the number of residents, $\operatorname{pop}(T)$, must be even. This is because in a homogeneous town, the residents can be paired up in such a way that each pair knows a common dish, and this pairing can be done in an even number of pairs. If $T$ is heterogeneous, then $\operatorname{pop}(T)$ must be odd, because in a heterogeneous town, the residents cannot be paired up in such a way that each pair knows a common dish, and this unpaired resident would make the population odd.

</think>
<answer> $T$ is homogeneous if and only if $\operatorname{pop}(T)$ is even. </answer>","Note that for every $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T), \operatorname{chef}_{T}(D) \leq 2$, because otherwise, $r_{1}, r_{2}, \ldots, r_{n}$ could not be a resident cycle. Without loss of generality, assume the cycle is $r_{1}, r_{2}, \ldots, r_{n}$. If $n$ is even, assign resident $r_{i}$ to group 1 if $i$ is odd, and to group 2 if $i$ is even. This is a valid group assignment, because the only pairs of residents who cook the same dish are $\left(r_{i}, r_{i+1}\right)$ for $i=1,2, \ldots, n-1$ and $\left(r_{n}, r_{1}\right)$. In each case, the residents are assigned to different groups. This proves $\operatorname{gr}(T)=2$, so $T$ is homogeneous.

On the other hand, if $n$ is odd, suppose for the sake of contradiction that there are only two groups. Then either $r_{1}$ and $r_{n}$ are in the same group, or for some $i, r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ are in the



same group. In either case, two residents in the same group share a dish, contradicting the requirement that no members of a group have a common dish. Hence $\operatorname{gr}(T) \geq 3$ when $n$ is odd, making $T$ heterogeneous.",0,True,392

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the town and the constraints. We know that each dish is known by exactly two residents, and each resident knows exactly two dishes. This means that the town can be represented as a bipartite graph where the residents are divided into two sets, and each edge represents a pair of residents who know the same dish. The goal is to find a set of cycles that cover all residents exactly once, which is known as a Hamiltonian cycle in the context of bipartite graphs.

Given that each dish is known by exactly two residents, we can think of the town as a 2-regular bipartite graph. A 2-regular graph is a graph where each vertex has degree 2, meaning each resident is connected to exactly two other residents. It is known that a 2-regular bipartite graph has a Hamiltonian cycle. This means that there is a cycle that visits each resident exactly once.

To see why, consider the following: in a 2-regular bipartite graph, we can start at any vertex and follow the edges to form a cycle. Since each vertex is connected to exactly two other vertices, and the graph is bipartite, we can alternate between the two sets of vertices, ensuring that we visit each vertex exactly once. This cycle will be a Hamiltonian cycle, covering all residents exactly once.

</think>
<answer>There are finitely many resident cycles in $T$ that cover all residents exactly once. </answer>","First note that the condition $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|=2$ for all $D$ implies that $\operatorname{pop}(T)=|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$, using the equation from problem 5 . So for the town in question, the population of the town equals the number of dishes in the town. Because no two chefs cook the same pair of dishes, it is impossible for such a town to have exactly two residents, and because each dish is cooked by exactly two chefs, it is impossible for such a town to have only one resident.

The claim is true for towns of three residents satisfying the conditions: such towns must have one resident who cooks dishes $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$, one resident who cooks dishes $d_{2}$ and $d_{3}$, and one resident who cooks dishes $d_{3}$ and $d_{1}$, and those three residents form a cycle. So proceed by (modified) strong induction: assume that for some $n>3$ and for all positive integers $k$ such that $3 \leq k<n$, every town $T$ with $k$ residents and $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|=2$ for all $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$ can be divided into a finite number of resident cycles such that each resident belongs to exactly one of the cycles. Let $T_{n}$ be a town of $n$ residents, and arbitrarily pick resident $r_{1}$ and dishes $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ cooked by $r_{1}$. Then there is exactly one other resident $r_{2}$ who also cooks $d_{2}$ (because $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T_{n}}\left(d_{2}\right)\right|=2$ ). But $r_{2}$ also cooks another dish, $d_{3}$, which is cooked by another resident, $r_{3}$. Continuing in this fashion, there can be only two outcomes: either the process exhausts all the residents of $T_{n}$, or there exists some resident $r_{m}, m<n$, who cooks the same dishes as $r_{m-1}$ and $r_{\ell}$ for $\ell<m-1$.

In the former case, $r_{n}$ cooks another dish; but every dish besides $d_{1}$ is already cooked by two chefs in $T_{n}$, so $r_{n}$ must also cook $d_{1}$, closing the cycle. Because every resident is in this cycle, the statement to be proven is also true for $T_{n}$.

In the latter case, the same logic shows that $r_{m}$ cooks $d_{1}$, also closing the cycle, but there are other residents of $T_{n}$ who have yet to be accounted for. Let $C_{1}=\left\{r_{1}, \ldots, r_{m}\right\}$, and consider the town $T^{\prime}$ whose residents are $T_{n} \backslash C_{1}$. Each of dishes $d_{1}, \ldots, d_{m}$ is cooked by two people in $C_{1}$, so no chef in $T^{\prime}$ cooks any of these dishes, and no dish in $T^{\prime}$ is cooked by any of the people in $C_{1}$ (because each person in $C_{1}$ already cooks two dishes in the set $\operatorname{dish}\left(C_{1}\right)$ ). Thus $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T^{\prime}}(D)\right|=2$ for each $D$ in $\operatorname{dish}\left(T^{\prime}\right)$. It follows that $\operatorname{pop}\left(T^{\prime}\right)<\operatorname{pop}(T)$ but $\operatorname{pop}\left(T^{\prime}\right)>0$, so by the inductive hypothesis, the residents of $T^{\prime}$ can be divided into disjoint resident cycles.

Thus the statement is proved by strong induction.",0,False,308

In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.

It so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.

| ARMLton |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Resident | Dishes |
| Paul | pie, turkey |
| Arnold | pie, salad |
| Kelly | salad, broth |


| ARMLville |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Resident | Dishes |
| Sally | steak, calzones |
| Ross | calzones, pancakes |
| David | steak, pancakes |

The population of a town $T$, denoted $\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\left\{r_{1}, \ldots, r_{\mathrm{pop}(T)}\right\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \{pie, turkey, salad, broth\}.

A town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.

Denote by $\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\left|\operatorname{dish}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d}\right)\right|=d$.

In order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \rightarrow\{1,2, \ldots, k\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\left(r_{i}\right)=f\left(r_{j}\right)$ for $i \neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.

For example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.


For a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\operatorname{chef}_{\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\{$ Sally, David $\}$.


If $\operatorname{gr}(T)=\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for some $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\operatorname{gr}(T)>\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for each dish $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.


A resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \leq i \leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \leq i, j \leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.
Let $T$ be a town such that, for each $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T),\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|=2$.

Prove that if $\operatorname{pop}(T)$ is odd, then $T$ is heterogeneous.

","First, let's consider the structure of the town $T$. Since each dish is known by exactly two residents, and there are no two residents who know the same pair of dishes, each dish is known by a unique pair of residents. This means that the set of dishes $\operatorname{dish}(T)$ can be paired up with the residents in such a way that each pair of dishes is known by a unique pair of residents. 

Given that $\operatorname{pop}(T)$ is odd, let's denote the number of residents by $n = \operatorname{pop}(T)$. Since $n$ is odd, it cannot be divided evenly into pairs, and there will be one resident left out. This means that when we try to form groups, one resident will be left without a group, and this resident will be a chef for a dish that no other resident knows. 

Now, let's consider the group assignment. Since each dish is known by exactly two residents, and there are no two residents who know the same pair of dishes, the group assignment must be such that each dish is known by a unique pair of residents. If we try to form groups, the resident who is left out will be a chef for a dish that no other resident knows, and this will be the only dish that the resident is a chef for. 

Since the resident who is left out is a chef for a dish that no other resident knows, and this dish is not known by any other resident, the group number $\operatorname{gr}(T)$ must be greater than the number of chefs for that dish. This is because the resident who is left out is a chef for a dish that no other resident knows, and this dish is not known by any other resident, so the group number must be greater than 2. 

Therefore, if $\operatorname{pop}(T)$ is odd, then $T$ is heterogeneous. </think>
<answer> $\operatorname{gr}(T) > \left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for each dish $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T) </answer>","In order for $T$ to be homogeneous, it must be possible to partition the residents into exactly two dining groups. First apply 10a to divide the town into finitely many resident cycles $C_{i}$, and assume towards a contradiction that such a group assignment $f: T \rightarrow$ $\{1,2\}$ exists. If $\operatorname{pop}(T)$ is odd, then at least one of the cycles $C_{i}$ must contain an odd number of residents; without loss of generality, suppose this cycle to be $C_{1}$, with residents $r_{1}, r_{2}, \ldots, r_{2 k+1}$. (By the restrictions noted in part a, $k \geq 1$.) Now because $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ cook a dish in common, $f\left(r_{i}\right) \neq f\left(r_{i+1}\right)$ for all $i$. Thus if $f\left(r_{1}\right)=1$, it follows that $f\left(r_{2}\right)=2$, and that $f\left(r_{3}\right)=1$, etc. So $f\left(r_{i}\right)=f\left(r_{1}\right)$ if $i$ is odd and $f\left(r_{i}\right)=f\left(r_{2}\right)$ if $i$ is



even; in particular, $f\left(r_{2 k+1}\right)=f(1)$. But that equation would imply that $r_{1}$ and $r_{2 k+1}$ cook no dishes in common, which is impossible if they are the first and last residents in a resident cycle. So no such group assignment can exist, and $\operatorname{gr}(T) \geq 3$. Hence $T$ is heterogeneous.",0,True,440

","First, let's consider the structure of the town and the constraints. We need to find a town where each dish is known by exactly three residents, and the total number of dishes is odd. Let's start by examining the possible combinations of residents and dishes. 

Given that each resident knows exactly two dishes, and no two residents know the same pair of dishes, we can start by considering the possible combinations of dishes that can be made by the residents. 

If we have a town with 3 residents, and each resident knows 2 dishes, then the total number of dishes known by the town is 6. This is even, so we need to consider a larger town. 

If we have 4 residents, and each resident knows 2 dishes, then the total number of dishes known by the town is 8, which is also even. 

If we have 5 residents, and each resident knows 2 dishes, then the total number of dishes known by the town is 10, which is also even. 

If we have 6 residents, and each resident knows 2 dishes, then the total number of dishes known by the town is 12, which is also even.

$$
\sum_{D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)}\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|=2 \operatorname{pop}(T) .
$$

Because each chef knows how to prepare exactly two dishes, and no two chefs know how to prepare the same two dishes, each chef is counted exactly twice in the sum $\Sigma\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$. More formally, consider the set of ""resident-dish pairs"":

$$
S=\{(r, D) \in T \times \operatorname{dish}(T) \mid r \text { makes } D\}
$$

Count $|S|$ in two different ways. First, every dish $D$ is made by $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ residents of $T$, so

$$
|S|=\sum_{D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)}\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|
$$

Second, each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, so

$$
|S|=\sum_{r \in T} 2=2 \operatorname{pop}(T)

Therefore $\sum_{D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)}\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ is even. But if $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|=3$ for all $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, then the sum is simply $3|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$, so $|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$ must be even.",0,False,3577

The population of a town $T$, denoted $\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\left\{r_{1}, \ldots, r_{\mathrm{pop}(T)}\right\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \{pie, turkey, salad, broth\}.

A town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.

Denote by $\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\left|\operatorname{dish}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d}\right)\right|=d$.

In order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \rightarrow\{1,2, \ldots, k\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\left(r_{i}\right)=f\left(r_{j}\right)$ for $i \neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.

For example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.


For a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\operatorname{chef}_{\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\{$ Sally, David $\}$.


If $\operatorname{gr}(T)=\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for some $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\operatorname{gr}(T)>\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for each dish $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.


A resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \leq i \leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \leq i, j \leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.
Let $T$ be a town such that, for each $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T),\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|=3$.

Prove that if $T$ contains a resident cycle such that for every dish $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, there exists a chef in the cycle that can prepare $D$, then $\operatorname{gr}(T)=3$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the town $T$ and the given conditions. We know that each dish is prepared by exactly three residents, and that for each dish, there is a resident in the cycle that can prepare it. We need to show that the group number $\operatorname{gr}(T)$ is 3. 

Since each dish is prepared by exactly three residents, and there are no two residents who know the same pair of dishes, the residents can be divided into groups of three, each group being responsible for a unique set of dishes. This means that if we can form a cycle that includes each of these groups, we can assign each group to a different group number, and thus $\operatorname{gr}(T) = 3$.

Now, let's consider the cycle. If we have a cycle that includes each of the three groups, and each group contains a resident who can prepare a unique dish, then we can assign each group to a different group number. This is because the cycle structure ensures that each group is distinct and each resident in the cycle is part of exactly one group. </think>
<answer> \operatorname{gr}(T) = 3 </answer>","First we prove that for any town $T$ and any $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T), \operatorname{gr}(T) \geq\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$.

Let $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$. Suppose that $f$ is a valid group assignment on $T$. Then for $r, s \in \operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$, if $r \neq s$, it follows that $f(r) \neq f(s)$. Hence there must be at least $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ distinct groups in the range of $f$, i.e., $\operatorname{gr}(T) \geq\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$.

By the conclusion above, it must be the case that $\operatorname{gr}(T) \geq 3$. Let $C=\left\{r_{1}, r_{2}, \ldots, r_{n}\right\}$ denote a resident cycle such that for every dish $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, there exists a chef in $C$ that can prepare $D$. Each resident is a chef for two dishes, and every dish can be made by two residents in $C$ (although by three in $T$ ). Thus the number of residents in the resident cycle $C$ is equal to $|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$, which was proved to be even in the previous part.

Define a group assignment by setting

$$
f(r)= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } r \notin C \\ 2 & \text { if } r=r_{i} \text { and } i \text { is even } \\ 3 & \text { if } r=r_{i} \text { and } i \text { is odd. }\end{cases}
$$

For any $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, there are exactly three $D$-chefs, and exactly two of them belong to the resident cycle $C$. Hence exactly one of the $D$-chefs $r$ will have $f(r)=1$. The remaining two $D$-chefs will be $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ for some $i$, or $r_{1}$ and $r_{n}$. In either case, the group assignment $f$ will assign one of them to 2 and the other to 3 . Thus any two residents who make a common dish will be assigned different groups by $f$, so $f$ is a valid group assignment, proving that $\operatorname{gr}(T)=3$.",0,True,247

In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.

Let $k$ be a positive integer, and let $T$ be a town in which $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|=k$ for every dish $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$. Suppose further that $|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$ is odd.

Show that $k$ is even.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the town and the constraints. We know that each resident knows exactly two dishes, and no two residents know the same pair of dishes. This means that the set of dishes known by the residents forms a complete set of pairs, and each pair is known by exactly one resident. The population of the town, $|\operatorname{pop}(T)|$, is the number of residents, and the number of dishes, $|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$, is the number of unique pairs of dishes known by the residents. Since $|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$ is odd, it means that the number of residents, $|\operatorname{pop}(T)|$, must be even. This is because each pair of dishes is known by exactly one resident, and the total number of pairs (dishes) is odd, which implies that the number of residents must be even to balance the equation.

Now, let's consider the group assignment. The group number of the town, $\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$. Given that $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|=k$ for every dish $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, and since $|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$ is odd, the number of chefs for each dish, $k$, must be even. This is because if $k$ were odd, it would be impossible to have an even number of chefs for each dish, given the constraints of the problem. </think>
<answer> k is even. </answer>","First, we Prove that
$$
\sum_{D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)}\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|=2 \operatorname{pop}(T) .
$$

Because each chef knows how to prepare exactly two dishes, and no two chefs know how to prepare the same two dishes, each chef is counted exactly twice in the sum $\Sigma\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$. More formally, consider the set of ""resident-dish pairs"":

$$
S=\{(r, D) \in T \times \operatorname{dish}(T) \mid r \text { makes } D\}
$$

Count $|S|$ in two different ways. First, every dish $D$ is made by $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ residents of $T$, so

$$
|S|=\sum_{D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)}\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|
$$

Second, each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, so

$$
|S|=\sum_{r \in T} 2=2 \operatorname{pop}(T)
$$

From above prove,

$$
2 \operatorname{pop}(T)=\sum_{D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)}\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|
$$

Because $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|=k$ for all $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, the sum is $k \cdot \operatorname{dish}(T)$. Thus $2 \operatorname{pop} T=$ $k \cdot \operatorname{dish}(T)$, and so $k \cdot \operatorname{dish}(T)$ must be even. By assumption, $|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$ is odd, so $k$ must be even.",0,True,345

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the structure of the town $T$ and the given conditions. We know that $|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)| = k$ for every dish $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, and $|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$ is odd. This means that the number of dishes in the town is odd, and each dish is cooked by exactly $k$ residents. 

Since $k$ is a positive integer, and $|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$ is odd, $k$ must be odd as well. This is because if $k$ were even, then the total number of residents, which is the sum of the number of residents who are $D$-chefs for each dish, would be even, which contradicts the fact that $|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$ is odd. 

Now, let's consider a group in $T$. If a group contains $m$ residents, and $k$ is odd, then the number of dishes that can be cooked by these $m$ residents is $mk$. Since $k$ is odd, $mk$ is odd if $m$ is odd, and even if $m$ is even. 

If the group contains an even number of residents, then the number of dishes that can be cooked by these residents is even, and since $|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$ is odd, it is impossible for all these dishes to be cooked by the residents in the group. This means that the group must contain an odd number of residents. 

If the group contains an odd number of residents, then the number of dishes that can be cooked by these residents is odd, and since $|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$ is odd, it is possible that all these dishes are cooked by the residents in the group. However, if we consider the structure of the town, and the fact that each dish is cooked by exactly $k$ residents, it is impossible for a group to contain all the residents who are $D$-chefs for a particular dish $D$ without violating the condition that no two residents in the group know how to make the same dish. </think>
<answer> For every group in $T$, there is some $\operatorname{dish} D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$ such that no one in the group is a $D$-chef. </answer>","Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is some $n$ for which the group $R=\{r \in$ $T \mid f(r)=n\}$ has a $D$-chef for every dish $D$. Because $f$ is a group assignment and $f$ assigns every resident of $R$ to group $n$, no two residents of $R$ make the same dish. Thus for every $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, exactly one resident of $R$ is a $D$-chef; and each $D$-chef cooks exactly one other dish, which itself is not cooked by anyone else in $R$. Thus the dishes come in pairs: for each dish $D$, there is another dish $D^{\prime}$ cooked by the $D$-chef in $R$ and no one else in $R$. However, if the dishes can be paired off, there must be an even number of dishes, contradicting the assumption that $|\operatorname{dish}(T)|$ is odd.

A resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \leq i \leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \leq i, j \leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise.

","First, let's consider the structure of a full town, $\mathcal{F}_d$. Since each resident knows exactly two dishes and no two residents know the same pair of dishes, the set of dishes that the residents collectively know is $\{D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_d\}$. We need to show that the group number of $\mathcal{F}_d$ is $d$.

To do this, we need to find a group assignment that satisfies the condition that if two residents are in the same group, they do not know the same dish. Let's consider the following approach: assign each resident to a group based on the dishes they know. Specifically, if a resident knows dishes $D_i$ and $D_j$, we can assign them to group $i$ or $j$. This way, no two residents in the same group know the same dish.

Now, let's count the number of groups. Since each dish is known by exactly two residents, and each resident is assigned to one of the two groups corresponding to the dishes they know, the number of groups is exactly $d$.

<answer> \operatorname{gr}(\mathcal{F}_d) = d </answer>","Fix $D \in \operatorname{dish}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d}\right)$. Then for every other dish $D^{\prime} \in \operatorname{dish}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d}\right)$, there is exactly one chef who makes both $D$ and $D^{\prime}$, hence $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{\mathcal{F}_{d}}(D)\right|=d-1$, which is even because $d$ is odd. Thus for each $D \in \operatorname{dish}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d}\right)$, $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{\mathcal{F}_{d}}(D)\right|$ is even. Because $\left|\operatorname{dish}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d}\right)\right|=d$ is odd and $\left|\operatorname{chef}_{\mathcal{F}_{d}}(D)\right|=d-1$ for every dish in $\mathcal{F}_{d}$, problem 12c applies, hence $\operatorname{gr}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d}\right)>d-1$.

Label the dishes $D_{1}, D_{2}, \ldots, D_{d}$, and label the residents $r_{i, j}$ for $1 \leq i<j \leq d$ so that $r_{i, j}$ is a $D_{i}$-chef and a $D_{j}$-chef. Define $f: \mathcal{F}_{d} \rightarrow\{0,1, \ldots, d-1\}$ by letting $f\left(r_{i, j}\right) \equiv i+j \bmod d$.

Suppose that $f\left(r_{i, j}\right)=f\left(r_{k, \ell}\right)$, so $i+j \equiv k+\ell \bmod d$. Then $r_{i, j}$ and $r_{k, \ell}$ are assigned to the same group, which is a problem if they are different residents but are chefs for the same dish. This overlap occurs if and only if one of $i$ and $j$ is equal to one of $k$ and $\ell$. If $i=k$, then $j \equiv \ell \bmod d$. As $j$ and $\ell$ are both between 1 and $d$, the only way they could be congruent modulo $d$ is if they were in fact equal. That is, $r_{i, j}$ is the same resident as $r_{k, \ell}$. The other three cases $(i=\ell, j=k$, and $j=\ell$ ) are analogous. Thus $f$ is a valid group assignment, proving that $\operatorname{gr}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d}\right) \leq d$. Therefore $\operatorname{gr}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d}\right)=d$.",0,False,281

In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\prime}$, where $k \geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum ""location, location, location,"" this Power Question will refer to ""houses"" and ""house numbers"" interchangeably.

Curiously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.


The neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\mathcal{N}(n)=\{m \mid d(m)=d(n)\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.
Notice that $d(16)=d(17)=1$ and that $d(16,17)=1$. Is it true that, for all $m, n$ such that $d(m)=d(n)=1$ and $m \neq n, d(m, n)=1$ ? Either prove your answer or find a counterexample.

","First, let's consider the given conditions. We need to check if for all $m, n$ such that $d(m) = d(n) = 1$ and $m \neq n$, it follows that $d(m, n) = 1$. 

Given that $d(m) = 1$, it means that $m$ can be either 3 or 1, since $d(3) = 1$ and $d(1) = 1$. Similarly, $n$ can be either 3 or 1. 

Now, let's consider the possible values for $m$ and $n$:
- If $m = 3$ and $n = 1$, then $d(m, n) = d(3, 1) = 1$.
- If $m = 1$ and $n = 3$, then $d(m, n) = d(1, 3) = 1$.
- If $m = 3$ and $n = 3$, then $d(m, n) = d(3, 3) = 0$.
- If $m = 1$ and $n = 1$, then $d(m, n) = d(1, 1) = 0$.

From the above, we see that when $m \neq n$ and $d(m) = d(n) = 1$, $d(m, n) = 1$. This is true for all combinations except when $m = n$ and $d(m) = 1$. </think>

","First, let's consider the distances involved in the given inequalities. We need to show that $d(17,51) \leq d(17,34)+d(34,51)$ and $d(17,95) \leq d(17,68)+d(68,95)$. 

Given the properties of the ARMLopolitan distance, we can use the fact that $d(m, n) = d(m-n)$. Let's start with the first inequality:
- $d(17,51) = d(51-17) = d(34)$
- $d(17,34) = d(34-17) = d(17)$
- $d(34,51) = d(51-34) = d(17)$

So, $d(17,51) = d(34) = d(17) + d(17)$. This shows that $d(17,51) \leq d(17,34) + d(34,51)$.

Now, let's consider the second inequality:
- $d(17,95) = d(95-17) = d(78)$
- $d(17,68) = d(68-17) = d(51)$
- $d(68,95) = d(95-68) = d(27)$

Assistant: <think>
","To prove that for all \(a\) and \(b\), \(d(a, b) \leq \max \{d(a), d(b)\}\), we need to consider the properties of the distance function \(d\). The distance function \(d(n)\) is defined in a specific way, and the key is to use the fact that the distance between two houses is the minimum distance from one house to the other, which is given by the formula \(d(m, n) = d(m - n)\).

Let's start by considering the two cases: when \(a = b\) and when \(a \neq b\).

1. **Case 1: \(a = b\)**

   If \(a = b\), then \(d(a, b) = d(a - a) = d(0) = 0\). Clearly, \(0 \leq \max \{d(a), d(b)\}\).

2. **Case 2: \(a \neq b\)**

   If \(a \neq b\), then \(d(a, b) = d(a - b)\). We need to show that \(d(a - b) \leq \max \{d(a), d(b)\}\).

   - If \(d(a) \geq d(b)\), then \(\max \{d(a), d(b)\} = d(a)\). Since \(d(a - b) \leq d(a)\), it follows that \(d(a - b) \leq d(a)\).

In this case, if $3 \mid\left(a_{0}-b_{0}\right)$, then $3^{\alpha}\left(a_{0}-b_{0}\right)=3^{\gamma} c$, where $3 \nmid c$ and $\alpha<\gamma$; so $d(a-b)=3^{-\gamma}<3^{-\alpha}=d(a)=d(b)$. If $3 \nmid\left(a_{0}-b_{0}\right)$, then $d(a, b)=3^{-\alpha}=d(a)=d(b)$. If $\alpha \neq \beta$, suppose, without loss of generality, that $\alpha<\beta$ (so that $d(a)>d(b))$. Then $a-b=3^{\alpha}\left(a_{0}-3^{\beta-\alpha} b_{0}\right)$. In this second factor, notice that the second term, $3^{\beta-\alpha} b_{0}$ is divisible by 3 but the first term $a_{0}$ is not, so their difference is not divisible by 3 .

","To prove that for all $a, b$, and $c$, $d(a, c) \leq \max \{d(a, b), d(b, c)\}$, we need to consider the properties of the distance function $d(n)$ and the triangle inequality in the context of ARMLopolis. 

First, let's recall that the distance function $d(n)$ is defined such that if $n = 3^k n'$ where $k \geq 0$ and $n'$ is not divisible by 3, then $d(n) = 3^{-k}$. This means that $d(n)$ is a fraction with a denominator that is a power of 3. 

The triangle inequality in ARMLopolis states that for any three houses $a$, $b$, and $c$, the distance from $a$ to $c$ is less than or equal to the sum of the distances from $a$ to $b$ and from $b$ to $c$. Mathematically, this is expressed as $d(a, c) \leq d(a, b) + d(b, c)$.

Now, let's consider the case when $a = b$. In this case, the triangle inequality simplifies to $d(a, c) \leq d(a, c)$, which is trivially true. 

For the general case, we need to show that $d(a, c) \leq \max \{d(a, b), d(b, c)\}$. 

If $a = b$, we already know that $d(a, c) = d(c, a) \leq \max \{d(a, b), d(b, c)\}$. 

If $a \neq b$, we can use the fact that the distance function is defined in a way that respects the structure of the numbers. Specifically, if $a$ and $b$ are such that $d(a, b)$ is the larger distance, then $d(a, c)$ must be less than or equal to $d(a, b)$, and similarly for $d(b, c)$. This is because the distance function is designed to reflect the structure of the numbers in a way that the larger distance between two points is reflected in the distance to a third point. </think>

","To prove that for all houses \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the inequality \(d(a, c) \leq d(a, b) + d(b, c)\) holds, we need to consider the properties of the distance function \(d\). The distance function \(d\) is defined in a way that it respects the structure of the ARMLopolitan houses and their distances. 

First, let's consider the case when \(a = b\). In this case, the inequality becomes \(d(a, c) \leq d(a, a) + d(a, c)\), which simplifies to \(d(a, c) \leq 0 + d(a, c)\), and this is clearly true since \(d(a, c)\) is a non-negative number.

Now, let's consider the general case where \(a \neq b\). We need to show that \(d(a, c) \leq d(a, b) + d(b, c)\). 

Given the properties of the distance function, we can use the fact that the distance between two houses is the sum of the distances from each house to a common reference point (City Hall). This is a key property that helps us to break down the problem. 

Let's denote the distance from house \(a\) to City Hall as \(d(a, 0)\), from house \(b\) to City Hall as \(d(b, 0)\), and from house \(c\) to City Hall as \(d(c, 0)\). According to the problem, the distance between houses \(a\) and \(c\) is \(d(a, c) = d(a, 0) - d(c, 0)\). 

We need to show that \(d(a, c) \leq d(a, b) + d(b, c)\). Using the distances to City Hall, this inequality becomes:
\[d(a, 0) - d(c, 0) \leq d(a, b) + d(b, c)\]
\[d(a, 0) - d(c, 0) \leq (d(a, 0) - d(b, 0)) + (d(b, 0) - d(c, 0))\]
\[d(a, 0) - d(c, 0) \leq d(a, 0) - d(c, 0)\]

After thinking about it some more, the visitor announces that all ARMLopolitan triangles have a special property. What is it? Justify your answer.
Assistant: <think>
","To determine the special property of all ARMLopolitan triangles, let's first consider the implications of the distance formula. The distance between two houses $n$ and $m$ is given by $d(m-n)$. This means that the distance between two houses is the same as the distance between the house that is $n$ houses away from the house that is $m$ houses away from City Hall. This suggests that the houses are arranged in a way that the distance between any two houses is the same as the distance between the house that is the difference between their indices from City Hall.

Now, let's think about the geometry of such a system. If we consider the distance between houses, it's clear that the houses are arranged in a way that the distance between any two houses is the same as the distance between the house that is the difference between their indices from City Hall. This implies that the houses are arranged in a way that the distance between any two houses is the same, which is a characteristic of a regular grid or a uniform distribution of points. 

In a uniform distribution, the triangles formed by any three houses will have the same properties as the distances between the houses, which means that the triangles will be equilateral. This is because the distance between any two points in a uniform distribution is the same, and thus, the distances between the vertices of any triangle formed by three points will be the same, making the triangle equilateral.

So either $d(a, b)=d(b, c)$ or, if not, then either $d(a, c)=d(a, b)$ or $d(a, c)=d(b, c)$. Thus all ARMLopolitan triangles are isosceles.",0,False,310

In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\prime}$, where $k \geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum ""location, location, location,"" this Power Question will refer to ""houses"" and ""house numbers"" interchangeably.

Curiously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.


The neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\mathcal{N}(n)=\{m \mid d(m)=d(n)\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.


Unfortunately for new development, ARMLopolis is full: every nonnegative integer corresponds to (exactly one) house (or City Hall, in the case of 0). However, eighteen families arrive and are looking to move in. After much debate, the connotations of using negative house numbers are deemed unacceptable, and the city decides on an alternative plan. On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.
Prove that the distance between houses with consecutive numbers does not change after the move.

","First, let's consider the distance function $d(n)$ and the relocation plan. The distance from house $n$ to City Hall is given by $d(n) = 3^{-k}$ if $n = 3^k n'$ where $k \geq 0$ and $n'$ is not divisible by 3. The relocation plan moves each family from house $n$ to house $n+18$. We need to show that the distance from City Hall to the new house number $n+18$ is the same as the distance from City Hall to the original house number $n$.

Let's start by examining the distance from City Hall to the new house number $n+18$. If $n = 3^k n'$, then the new house number is $n+18 = 3^k n' + 18$. We need to check if this new distance is $d(n) = 3^{-k}$. 

Since $18 = 3^1 \cdot 6$, and $6$ is not divisible by 3, we can consider the distance from City Hall to $n+18$ in terms of the distance from City Hall to $n$. The distance from City Hall to $n+18$ is $3^{-k} + 18/3^k = 3^{-k} + 6/3^k = 3^{-k} + k \cdot 3^{-k} = k \cdot 3^{-k} = k \cdot d(n)$. However, since $k$ is an integer, and considering the structure, it simplifies to, ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... </think>

","First, let's consider the distance from City Hall to house 1, which is $d(1) = 1$. The neighborhood of house 1, $\mathcal{N}(1)$, consists of all houses that are 1 unit away from City Hall, i.e., $\mathcal{N}(1) = \{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \ldots\}$. 

Now, let's consider the distance from City Hall to house 19, which is $d(19) = 1/3$. The neighborhood of house 19, $\mathcal{N}(19)$, consists of all houses that are $1/3$ unit away from City Hall, i.e., $\mathcal{N}(19) = \{1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, \ldots\}$. 

When the families move from house 1 to house 19, the new neighborhood of house 1, $\mathcal{N}'(1)$, will be the set of houses that are $1/3$ unit away from City Hall, i.e., $\mathcal{N}'(1) = \{1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, \ldots\}$.

Some residents of $\mathcal{N}(9)$ claim that their tightly-knit community will be disrupted by the move: they will be scattered between different neighborhoods after the change. Will they? Justify your answer.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the neighborhood of house 9, denoted as $\mathcal{N}(9)$. According to the definition, $\mathcal{N}(9)$ consists of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as house 9. Since $9 = 3^2$, we have $d(9) = 3^{-2} = 1/9$. Therefore, $\mathcal{N}(9) = \{m \mid d(m) = 1/9\}$. This means that $\mathcal{N}(9)$ includes all houses that are 1/9 units away from City Hall, which are the fractions of the form $k/9$ where $k$ is an integer. </think>
<answer> \mathcal{N}(9) = \left\{ \frac{k}{9} \mid k \in \mathbb{Z} \right\} </answer>
<think> Shewad Movers relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$. We need to check if the fractions in $\mathcal{N}(9)$ will be scattered between different neighborhoods after the move. Let's consider the fractions in $\mathcal{N}(9)$: $$\frac{0}{9}, \frac{1}{9}, \frac{2}{9}, \frac{3}{9}, \frac{4}{9}, \frac{5}{9}, \frac{6}{9}, \frac{7}{9}, \frac{8}{9}.$$ After the move, these fractions will be relocated to $$\frac{18}{9}, \frac{19}{9}, \frac{20}{9}, \frac{21}{9}, \frac{22}{9}, \frac{23}{9}, \frac{24}{9}, \frac{25}{9}, \frac{26}{9}.$$ Clearly, these fractions are not in the same neighborhood as they were before, as they are all shifted by 18. </think>
<answer> \mathcal{N}(9) = \left\{ \frac{k}{9} \mid k \in \mathbb{Z} \right\} \text{ will be scattered between different neighborhoods after the move.} </answer>","Yes, they will be split apart. If $a \in \mathcal{N}(9)$, then $9 \mid a$ but $27 \nmid a$, so $a=27 k+9$ or $a=27 k+18$.

In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\prime}$, where $k \geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum ""location, location, location,"" this Power Question will refer to ""houses"" and ""house numbers"" interchangeably.

Curiously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.


The neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\mathcal{N}(n)=\{m \mid d(m)=d(n)\}$.

Unfortunately for new development, ARMLopolis is full: every nonnegative integer corresponds to (exactly one) house (or City Hall, in the case of 0). However, eighteen families arrive and are looking to move in. After much debate, the connotations of using negative house numbers are deemed unacceptable, and the city decides on an alternative plan. On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.

Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the initial arrangement of houses. The neighborhood of house 9, $\mathcal{N}(9)$, includes houses that are the same distance from City Hall as 9. According to the given, $d(9) = 1/3$. This means that $\mathcal{N}(9)$ includes houses that are at a distance of $1/3$ from City Hall, which are the fractions of the form $k/3$ where $k$ is an integer. Specifically, $\mathcal{N}(9) = \{... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ... \}$. 

Now, let's consider the relocation of families. Shewad Movers relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$. This means that the family in house 9 will move to house 27, the family in house 17 will move to house 35, and so on. 

We need to check if the new neighborhood of house 9, $\mathcal{N}(27)$, includes houses that were previously in $\mathcal{N}(9)$. The new neighborhood $\mathcal{N}(27)$ includes houses that are at a distance of $1/3$ from City Hall, which are the fractions of the form $k/3$ where $k$ is an integer. Specifically, $\mathcal{N}(27) = \{... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ... \}$. 

Since the fractions of the form $k/3$ where $k$ is an integer are the same in both $\mathcal{N}(9)$ and $\mathcal{N}(27)$, the new neighborhood of house 9 will indeed include the families that were previously in $\mathcal{N}(9)$. </think>
<answer> ... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ... </answer>","The question is whether it is possible that $x \notin \mathcal{N}(9)$ but $x+18 \in \mathcal{N}(9)$. Because $d(9)=1 / 9$, there are two cases to consider: $d(x)>1 / 9$ and $d(x)<1 / 9$. In the first case, $9 \nmid x$ (either $x$ is not divisible by 3 , or $x$ is divisible by 3 and not 9 ). These houses do not move into $\mathcal{N}(9): x \not \equiv 0 \bmod 9 \Rightarrow x+18 \not \equiv 0 \bmod 9$. On the other hand, if $d(x)<1 / 9$, then $27 \mid x$, i.e., $x=27 k$. Then $x+18=27 k+18$ which is divisible by 9 but not by 27 , so $d(x+18)=9$. So in fact every house $x$ of ARMLopolis with $d(x)<1 / 9$ will move into $\mathcal{N}(9)$ !",0,False,419

One day, Paul (house 23) and Sally (house 32), longtime residents of $\mathcal{N}(1)$, are discussing the "" 2 side"" of the neighborhood, that is, the set of houses $\{n \mid n=3 k+2, k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. Paul says ""I feel like I'm at the center of the "" 2 side"": when I looked out my window, I realized that the ""2 side"" consists of exactly those houses whose distance from me is at most $1 / 3 . ""$ Prove that Paul is correct.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the set of houses that are on the ""2 side,"" which are of the form $3k+2$ for integer $k$. We need to show that the distance from any house on the ""2 side"" to Paul's house (house 23) is at most $1/3$.

Let's start by considering the distance from a house $3k+2$ to Paul's house, which is 23. The distance $d(3k+2, 23)$ is given by $d(3k+2-23) = d(3k-21)$. According to the given rule, if $3k-21 = 3^m n'$ where $m \geq 0$ and $n'$ is not divisible by 3, then $d(3k-21) = 3^{-m}$. 

Now, let's check if $3k-21$ can be expressed in this form. We need to find $m$ and $n'$ such that $3k-21 = 3^m n'$. If we set $m = 1$, then $3k-21 = 3^1 n'$, which means $k-7 = n'$. Since $k$ is an integer, $n' = k-7$ is also an integer, and $n'$ is not divisible by 3 (as $k$ is not divisible by 3, otherwise $k-7$ would be divisible by 3). 

Thus, $d(3k-21) = 3^{-1} = 1/3$. This shows that the distance from any house on the ""2 side"" to Paul's house is indeed at most $1/3$.

For any $x$, let $\mathcal{D}_{r}(x)=\{y \mid d(x, y) \leq r\}$, that is, $\mathcal{D}_{r}(x)$ is the disk of radius $r$. Prove that if $d(x, z)=r$, then $\mathcal{D}_{r}(x)=\mathcal{D}_{r}(z) . \quad[2 \mathrm{pts}]$

First, let's consider the definition of the distance function. If \(d(x, z) = r\), then by the properties of the distance function, we have \(d(z, x) = r\) as well. This means that the distance from \(z\) to \(x\) is also \(r\).

Since \(d(x, z) = r\), any house \(y\) that is at a distance \(r\) from \(x\) will also be at a distance \(r\) from \(z\). This is because the distance function is symmetric, meaning \(d(x, y) = d(z, y)\) whenever \(d(x, z) = r\).

- The sum of the first four terms is 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/6 = 2.666... and so on.

Assistant: <think>
","To show that every sequence of three consecutive positive integers contains a cromulent element, we need to consider the properties of the numbers in the sequence. Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(a\), \(a+1\), and \(a+2\). We need to check if any of these numbers are relatively prime to the other two.

First, let's consider the possibility that \(a\), \(a+1\), and \(a+2\) are all relatively prime to each other. This would mean that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of any two of these numbers is 1. However, we can quickly see that this is not possible because among any three consecutive integers, at least one of them is divisible by 2. This is because in any set of three consecutive integers, one of them must be even, and the even number is divisible by 2. Since 2 is a common divisor of at least one of the numbers, they cannot all be relatively prime to each other.

Next, let's consider the possibility that one of the numbers is cromulent. We need to check if any of the numbers \(a\), \(a+1\), or \(a+2\) is relatively prime to the other two. We can start by checking the number \(a+1\). Since \(a+1\) is odd, it cannot be divisible by 2. We need to check if it is relatively prime to \(a\) and \(a+2\). </think>

","To show that every sequence of four consecutive positive integers contains a cromulent element, we need to consider the properties of the numbers in the sequence. Let's denote the sequence as \(a, a+1, a+2, a+3\). We need to find an element in this sequence that is relatively prime to all other elements. 

First, let's consider the possibility that one of the numbers is divisible by a small prime number. If any of the numbers is divisible by 2, 3, or 5, then it cannot be cromulent because it will share a common factor with at least one other number in the sequence. However, we need to check if there is a number that is not divisible by these primes and is still cromulent.

Let's check the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4:
- 1 is relatively prime to all other numbers.
- 2 is divisible by 2, so it is not cromulent.
- 3 is relatively prime to 1, 2, and 4.
- 4 is divisible by 2, so it is not cromulent.

From this, we see that 3 is a cromulent element in the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4. </think>
<answer>3</answer>","First we prove that any two consecutive odd positive integers are relatively prime to each other.

Proof: Two consecutive odd integers differ by 2 . Thus any common divisor of the two integers must also divide 2 . However, the only prime divisor of 2 is 2 , and neither of the consecutive odd integers is a multiple of 2 . Therefore any two consecutive odd integers are relatively prime to each other, as desired.

Consider a sequence of four consecutive integers. Notice that two of these integers will be odd, and by the proof above, these are relatively prime to each other. At most one of these two odd integers can be a multiple of 3 . Let $a$ be an odd integer in the sequence that is not a multiple of 3 . Then $a$ is cromulent by the following reasoning. Note that the difference between $a$ and any other element of the sequence is at most 3. Thus if $a$ shared a common factor greater than 1 with some other element of the sequence, this factor would have to be 2 or 3 .

First, let's consider the possibility that \(a\) itself is cromulent. If \(a\) is a prime number, then it is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence. However, if \(a\) is not a prime, we need to check if any of the other numbers in the sequence can be cromulent. </think>
<answer> a+2 </answer> </answer>","Consider a sequence of five consecutive integers. Exactly one number in such a sequence will be a multiple of 5 , but that number could also be a multiple of 2 and hence share a common factor with at least one other number in the sequence. There are several cases to consider, namely whether the sequence starts with an even number or an odd number.

If the sequence starts with an even number, then the second and fourth numbers are both odd, and at least one of them is not a multiple of 3 and hence is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence because it is neither a multiple of 2 nor 3 and hence is at least 5 away from the nearest integer with a common factor. Thus the sequence contains a cromulent element.

If the sequence starts with an odd number, then again, it contains an odd number that is not a multiple of 3 and hence is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence, thus the sequence contains a cromulent element.

","To prove that there is at least one cromulent element in every sequence of 8 consecutive positive integers, we need to consider the properties of the numbers and their relationships. Let's denote the sequence of 8 consecutive integers as \(a, a+1, a+2, a+3, a+4, a+5, a+6, a+7\).

A cromulent element in this sequence is one that is relatively prime to all other elements. We need to show that at least one of these numbers is relatively prime to the others. 

First, let's consider the possibility that none of the numbers are cromulent. If none of the numbers are cromulent, then each number must share a common factor with at least one other number. However, since the numbers are consecutive, they do not share a common factor greater than 1 with each other. The only way to share a common factor is if they are divisible by the same prime number, but this would require a common factor greater than 1, which is not possible for consecutive numbers.

","To prove that there is at least one cromulent element in every sequence of 9 consecutive positive integers, we need to consider the properties of the numbers and their relationships. Let's denote the sequence of 9 consecutive integers as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+8\). We need to show that at least one of these numbers is relatively prime to all the others.

First, let's consider the possibility that all 9 numbers are relatively prime to each other. This would be true if none of the numbers share any prime factors. However, since we are dealing with 9 consecutive numbers, at least one of them must be divisible by 3 (as every third number is divisible by 3). This means that 3 is a common factor among the numbers, and thus, they are not all relatively prime to each other.

Next, let's consider the possibility that there is a cromulent element. If we can find a number in the sequence that is not divisible by 3, then it will be relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence. We need to check if there is such a number in the sequence of 9 consecutive integers.

If we take the sequence to be \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+8\), and if \(a \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3}\), then \(a+3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\) and \(a+6 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\). This means that 3 is a factor in the sequence, but we can still check if there is another number that is not divisible by 3. </think>
<answer> a, a+2, a+4, a+5, a+7, a+8 </answer>","First we prove that there is at least one cromulent element in every sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers with $n=8$;

Proof: In any sequence of eight consecutive integers, four of them will be even and hence not cromulent. The primes 3,5 , and 7 are the only numbers that could possibly divide more than one number in the sequence, with 5 and 7 each dividing at most one of the four odd numbers. Note that for 7 to divide two numbers in the sequence, they must be the first and last numbers because only those differ by 7 . The prime 3 can divide two odd numbers in the sequence, but only if they differ by 6 , which means they must be either the 1st and 7th or the $2 \mathrm{nd}$ and 8th numbers in the list. Therefore one of the two odd multiples of 3 would also be the only candidate to be an odd multiple of 7 when there are two multiples of 7 , and so at least one of the four odd numbers must be cromulent.

Now we turn to prove that given assumption. In a sequence of nine consecutive integers, again the only primes to check are $2,3,5$, and 7 . If there are five even numbers in the sequence, then at least one of the odd numbers is cromulent by similar reasoning to the proof above. The difference is that in this case the multiples of 7 can be either the 1st and 8th or the 2nd and 9th numbers, while the odd multiples of 3 must be the 2 nd and 8th numbers (because the 1st number is even) and hence overlap with the multiples of 7 again. If instead there are four even numbers in the sequence, then the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th numbers are odd. Now 7 divides at most one of these odd numbers, 5 divides at most one, and 3 divides at most two, leaving at least one odd cromulent element.",0,True,380

In a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers, where $n>1$, an element of the sequence is said to be cromulent if it is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence. Every element of a sequence with $n=2$ is cromulent because any two consecutive integers are relatively prime to each other.

The goal of this problem is to prove the following claim:

Claim: For $k \geq 300$, there is a sequence of $k$ consecutive integers with no cromulent elements.

Let $\pi(n)$ denote the number of primes less than or equal to $n$. You may use the following lemma without proof in the problems that follow.

Lemma: For $x \geq 75, \pi(2 x)-\pi(x) \geq 2\left\lfloor\log _{2}(x)\right\rfloor+2$.

One argument for proving the above claim begins as follows. Let $m=\left\lfloor\frac{k}{4}\right\rfloor \geq 75$, let $p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots, p_{r}$ denote the primes in the set $\{1,2, \ldots, m\}$ (note that $p_{1}=2$ ), and let $p_{r+1}, p_{r+2}, \ldots, p_{s}$ denote the primes in the set $\{m+1, m+2, \ldots, 2 m\}$.

Given that $m = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{4} \right\rfloor \geq 75$, we know that the primes in the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, m\}$ are $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_r$ and the primes in the set $\{m+1, m+2, \ldots, 2m\}$ are $p_{r+1}, p_{r+2}, \ldots, p_s$. 

If each of the $k$ consecutive integers is divisible by at least one of these primes, then each integer in the sequence is divisible by at least one of the primes $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s$. This means that no integer in the sequence can be relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence, as it would need to be relatively prime to all primes $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s$ to be cromulent. </think>

Then $a_{j+p}=a_{j}+p$, so $a_{j+p}$ is also divisible by $p$. Hence neither $a_{j}$ nor $a_{j+p}$ is cromulent because both numbers are divisible by $p$ (also note that $j+p<4 m \leq k$, so $a_{j+p}$ is one of the $k$ integers in the sequence). Thus none of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{2 m}$ are cromulent.

form a sequence of $2 m+1$ consecutive odd integers of the form $x \pm 2 y$, where $y$ varies from 0 to $m$.

Prove that every number in the above sequence, except those in which $y$ is a power of 2 , is divisible by one of the primes $p_{2}, \ldots, p_{r}$.

","First, let's consider the sequence of $2m+1$ consecutive odd integers: $x-2m, x-2m+2, \ldots, x-2, x, x+2, \ldots, x+2m-2, x+2m$. We need to show that except for the numbers where $y$ is a power of 2, each number in this sequence is divisible by one of the primes $p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_r$.

Given that $x$ is a solution to the system of congruences $x \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$ and $x \equiv 0 \pmod{p_2 p_3 \cdots p_r}$, we can write $x = k p_2 p_3 \cdots p_r + 1$ for some integer $k$. 

Now, let's consider the numbers in the sequence. For $y = k$, the number is $x - 2m = k p_2 p_3 \cdots p_r + 1 - 2m$. Since $k p_2 p_3 \cdots p_r$ is divisible by $p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_r$, and $2m$ is not divisible by these primes, $x - 2m$ is not divisible by any of these primes. 

For $y = k-1$, the number is $x - 2m + 2 = k p_2 p_3 \cdots p_r + 1 - 2m + 2 = k p_2 p_3 \cdots p_r + 3$. This number is also not divisible by any of the primes $p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_r$ because $k p_2 p_3 \cdots p_r$ is divisible by these primes, and adding 3 (which is odd and not divisible by 2 or any of the primes) does not make it divisible by any of these primes. </think>

An $\boldsymbol{n}$-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$. For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:

$$
\underline{263} 415 \rightarrow 132 ; \quad 2 \underline{63415} \rightarrow 312 ; \quad 26 \underline{341} 5 \rightarrow 231 ; \quad 263 \underline{415} \rightarrow 213
$$

Moving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write

$$
S_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)
$$

More generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible. A possible signature is one that occurs for at least one $n$-label.

In this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures.
Explain why the label 1234 has a unique 3-signature.
Assistant: <think>
","To determine why the label 1234 has a unique 3-signature, we need to consider the possible 3-labels that can be formed from the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. A 3-label is a permutation of these numbers, and we can form 3-labels by considering all possible combinations of three numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4}.

Let's list the possible 3-labels:
- 123
- 124
- 134
- 234

Now, let's consider the 3-signature of the label 1234. The 3-signature is a 3-tuple of 3-labels, which means we need to consider the relative order of the numbers in the blocks formed by the label 1234 when divided into three parts. The label 1234 can be divided into three parts in the following ways:
- 123, 4
- 12, 34
- 1, 234

Let's analyze each case:
1. For the block 123, the 3-label is 123.
2. For the block 4, the 3-label is 4.
3. For the block 12, the 3-label is 12.
4. For the block 34, the 3-label is 34.
5. For the block 1, the 3-label is 1.
6. For the block 234, the 3-label is 234.

The 3-signature of 1234 is the 3-tuple of these 3-labels: (123, 4, 12, 34, 1, 234). This 3-tuple is unique because it is formed from the only possible 3-labels that can be derived from the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 when divided into three parts in the way described. </think>
<answer> (123, 4, 12, 34, 1, 234) </answer>","We will prove this by contradiction. Suppose for some other 4-label $L$ we have $S_{3}[L]=$ $S_{3}[1234]=(123,123)$. Write out $L$ as $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}$. From the first window of $S_{3}[L]$, we have $a_{1}<a_{2}<a_{3}$. From the second window, we have $a_{2}<a_{3}<a_{4}$. Connecting these inequalities gives $a_{1}<a_{2}<a_{3}<a_{4}$, which forces $L=1234$, a contradiction. Therefore, the 3 -signature above is unique.",0,False,479

Explain why the 3 -signature $(123,321)$ is impossible.
Assistant: <think>
","To determine why the 3 -signature $(123,321)$ is impossible, we need to consider the constraints of the labels and the windows. The 3 -signature $(123,321)$ suggests that the labels 1, 2, and 3 are in the windows in the order 123, and then in the next window, 321. However, this is impossible because the labels 1, 2, and 3 can only be in one order in each window, and the windows are consecutive blocks of 3 numbers. If we try to fit 123 in one window and 321 in the next, we would need to repeat the labels, which is not allowed. </think>

Elizabeth is in an ""escape room"" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to ""flip"" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.

Let $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).

For convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.
Show that if $n+k$ is even and $\frac{n}{2}<k<n$, then $E(n, k)=3$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the conditions given: $n+k$ is even and $\frac{n}{2} < k < n$. This means that $k$ is an integer between $\frac{n}{2}$ and $n$ that is not equal to $\frac{n}{2}$. We need to show that $E(n, k) = 3$ under these conditions. 

Let's start by examining the possible states of the switches. Since $k$ is an integer between $\frac{n}{2}$ and $n$, flipping $k$ switches in one minute will not necessarily result in all switches being on. We need to consider the possibility of flipping switches in two or three minutes to achieve the goal.

If we flip $k$ switches in the first minute, we need to flip the remaining switches in the second minute to reach the goal. However, since $k$ is not $\frac{n}{2}$, flipping $k$ switches in the first minute will not leave the remaining switches in a state that can be flipped to on in the second minute. 

Instead, let's consider flipping $k$ switches in the first minute and then flipping the remaining switches in the third minute. This approach uses the fact that $n+k$ is even, which means that flipping the remaining switches in the third minute will result in all switches being on. </think>
<answer>3</answer>","First, because $k<n$, not all switches can be flipped in one minute, and so $E(n, k) \neq 1$. Second, because $k>\frac{n}{2}$, some switches must be flipped twice in the first two minutes, and so $E(n, k) \neq 2$.

Here is a strategy by which Elizabeth can escape in three minutes. Note that because $n+k$ is even, it follows that $3 k-n=(k+n)+2(k-n)$ is also even. Then let $3 k-n=2 b$. Note that $b>0$ (because $k>\frac{n}{2}$ ), and $b<k$ (because $k<n$ ).

Elizabeth's strategy is to flip switches 1 through $b$ three times each, and the remaining $n-b$ switches once each. This is possible because $n-b=(3 k-2 b)-b=3(k-b)$ is divisible by 3 , and $b+\frac{n-b}{3}=b+(k-b)=k$. Therefore, each minute, Elizabeth can flip switches 1 through $b$, and one-third of the $3(k-b)$ switches from $b+1$ through $n$. This allows her to escape in three minutes, as desired.",0,False,286

For convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.
Show that if $n$ is even and $k$ is odd, then $E(n, k)=E(n,n-k)$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the nature of the problem. We need to find the minimum number of minutes required to have all $n$ switches on, given that each minute we can flip exactly $k$ switches. The key observation is that the parity (odd or even nature) of $k$ and $n$ plays a crucial role in determining the solution. 

If $n$ is even and $k$ is odd, we need to consider how we can use the switches to achieve the goal. One useful approach is to think about the symmetry in the problem. If we can find a way to use the switches in a symmetric pattern, it might help us achieve the goal more efficiently. 

Let's consider the case where $n = 2m$ (i.e., $n$ is even) and $k = 2m - 1$ (i.e., $k$ is odd). We need to find a way to flip the switches such that all $2m$ switches are on. 

One way to approach this is to consider the following: if we flip the switches in a pattern that is symmetric around the middle, we might be able to achieve the goal. For example, if we flip the switches in the pattern (1, 2, 3, ..., m, m, m-1, ..., 1), we can see that the switches in the middle will be flipped an odd number of times, and the switches on the outside will be flipped an even number of times. This pattern will ensure that all switches are on after the appropriate number of minutes. 

</think>
<answer> E(n, k) = E(n, n-k) </answer>","Because $n$ is even, and because each switch must be flipped an odd number of times in order to escape, the total number of flips is even. Because $k$ must be odd, $E(n, k)$ must be even. To show this, consider the case where $E(n, k)$ is odd. If $E(n, k)$ is odd, then an odd number of flips happen an odd number of times, resulting in an odd number of total flips. This is a contradiction because $n$ is even.

Call a switch ""non-flipped"" in any given minute if it is not among the switches flipped in that minute. Because $E(n, k)$ (i.e., the total number of minutes) is even, and each switch is flipped an odd number of times, each switch must also be non-flipped an odd number of times. Therefore any sequence of flips that solves the "" $(n, k)$ puzzle"" can be made into a sequence of flips that solves the "" $(n, n-k)$ "" puzzle by interchanging flips and non-flips. These sequences last for the same number of minutes, and therefore $E(n, k)=E(n, n-k)$.",0,False,346

","First, let's consider the constraints and the goal. We need to find the minimum number of minutes required to have all $n$ switches on, given that we can flip exactly $k$ switches per minute, and $k \leq \frac{n}{2}$. We are also given that $n$ and $k$ are both even, and $k \leq \frac{n}{2}$. 

Since $k$ is even and $k \leq \frac{n}{2}$, we can think about the possibility of flipping the switches in a pattern that might help us achieve the goal. One way to approach this is to consider the possibility of flipping the switches in a cycle, where each switch is flipped once per cycle. 

If we consider flipping the switches in a cycle, we can see that flipping each switch once per cycle will take $\frac{n}{k}$ minutes. However, since $k$ is even, $\frac{n}{k}$ might not be an integer, and we need to round up to the next whole number to ensure we complete the cycle. This is where the ceiling function $\left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil$ comes in. </think>
<answer> \left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil </answer>","First, if $k$ divides $n$, then $E(n, k)=\frac{n}{k}=\left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil$. Assume then that $k$ does not divide $n$. Then let $r=\left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil$, which implies $(r-1) k<n<r k$.

Because $(r-1) k<n$, it follows that $r-1$ minutes are not enough to flip each switch once, so $E(n, k) \geq r$.

Because $n$ and $k$ are even, it follows that $r k$ and $r k-n$ are also even. Then $r k-n=2 b$ for some integer $b \geq 1$, and note that $b<k$ because $r k-k<n$. Then the following strategy turns all of the lights on in $r$ minutes.

- In each of the first three minutes, flip switches 1 through $b$, along with the next $k-b$ switches that have not yet been flipped. This leaves $b+3(k-b)$ lights on, and the rest off. Note that $b+3(k-b)=3 k-2 b=3 k-(r k-n)=n-k(r-3)$.
- In each of the remaining $r-3$ minutes, flip the first $k$ switches that have never been flipped before.

This strategy turns on the remaining $k(r-3)$ lights, and Elizabeth escapes the room after $r$ minutes.",0,False,270

Elizabeth is in an ""escape room"" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to ""flip"" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.

Let $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).

For convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.
Prove that if $k$ is odd and $k \leq \frac{n}{2}$, then either $E(n, k)=\left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil$ or $E(n, k)=\left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil+1$.

","First, let's consider the nature of the problem. We need to find the minimum number of minutes required to turn on all $n$ switches, given that we can flip exactly $k$ switches per minute. The key observation is that if $k$ is odd, then flipping $k$ switches in a single minute will result in an odd number of switches being on, and if $k$ is even, it will result in an even number of switches being on. 

Given that $k \leq \frac{n}{2}$, we can start by considering the possibility of reaching the goal in $\left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil$ minutes. This is because if we can achieve the goal in this number of minutes, it would be the minimum possible. However, if we need to adjust to reach the goal, we might need to add an extra minute. 

Let's analyze the case when $k$ is odd and $k \leq \frac{n}{2}$. If we can reach the goal in $\left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil$ minutes, then we are done. Otherwise, we need to consider the possibility of needing an extra minute. </think>
<answer> \left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil \text{ or } \left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil + 1 </answer>","First we prove that if $n$ and $k$ are both even and $k \leq \frac{n}{2}$, then $E(n, k)=\left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil$.

Proof. First, if $k$ divides $n$, then $E(n, k)=\frac{n}{k}=\left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil$. Assume then that $k$ does not divide $n$. Then let $r=\left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil$, which implies $(r-1) k<n<r k$.

Because $(r-1) k<n$, it follows that $r-1$ minutes are not enough to flip each switch once, so $E(n, k) \geq r$.

Because $n$ and $k$ are even, it follows that $r k$ and $r k-n$ are also even. Then $r k-n=2 b$ for some integer $b \geq 1$, and note that $b<k$ because $r k-k<n$. Then the following strategy turns all of the lights on in $r$ minutes.

- In each of the first three minutes, flip switches 1 through $b$, along with the next $k-b$ switches that have not yet been flipped. This leaves $b+3(k-b)$ lights on, and the rest off. Note that $b+3(k-b)=3 k-2 b=3 k-(r k-n)=n-k(r-3)$.
- In each of the remaining $r-3$ minutes, flip the first $k$ switches that have never been flipped before.

This strategy turns on the remaining $k(r-3)$ lights, and Elizabeth escapes the room after $r$ minutes.


First, if $k$ divides $n$, then $E(n, k)=\frac{n}{k}=\left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil$. Assume then that $k$ does not divide $n$. Then let $r=\left\lceil\frac{n}{k}\right\rceil$, which implies $(r-1) k<n<r k$.

Because $(r-1) k<n$, it follows that $r-1$ minutes are not enough to flip each switch once, so $E(n, k) \geq r$.



Exactly one of $r k-n$ and $(r+1) k-n$ is even. There are two cases.

Case 1: Suppose $r k-n=2 b$ for some integer $b \geq 1$. As in the proof above, b<k$. Then the following strategy turns all of the lights on in $r$ minutes.

- In each of the first three minutes, flip switches 1 through $b$, along with the next $k-b$ switches that have not yet been flipped. This leaves $b+3(k-b)$ lights on, and the rest off. Note that $b+3(k-b)=3 k-2 b=3 k-(r k-n)=n-k(r-3)$.
- In each of the remaining $r-3$ minutes, flip the first $k$ switches that have never been flipped before.

This strategy turns on the remaining $k(r-3)$ lights, and Elizabeth escapes the room after $r$ minutes.

Case 2: Suppose $(r+1) k-n=2 b$ for some integer $b \geq 1$. As in the solution to proof above, b<k$. Then the following strategy turns all of the lights on in $r+1$ minutes.

- In each of the first three minutes, flip switches 1 through $b$, along with the next $k-b$ switches that have not yet been flipped. This leaves $b+3(k-b)$ lights on, and the rest off. Note that $b+3(k-b)=3 k-2 b=3 k-(r k+k-n)=n-k(r-2)$.
- In each of the remaining $r-2$ minutes, flip the first $k$ switches that have never been flipped before.

This strategy turns on the remaining $k(r-2)$ lights, and Elizabeth escapes the room after $r+1$ minutes.",0,False,296

Define $E(n, k)=\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).

For convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.
One might guess that in most cases, $E(n, k) \approx \frac{n}{k}$. In light of this guess, define the inefficiency of the ordered pair $(n, k)$, denoted $I(n, k)$, as

$$
I(n, k)=E(n, k)-\frac{n}{k}
$$

if $E(n, k) \neq \infty$. If $E(n, k)=\infty$, then by convention, $I(n, k)$ is undefined.

Prove that for any integer $x>2$, there exists an ordered pair $(n, k)$ for which $I(n, k)>x$.
Assistant: <think>
","First, let's consider the given inequality $I(n, k) > x$ and the expression for $I(n, k)$. We need to find an ordered pair $(n, k)$ such that $E(n, k) - \frac{n}{k} > x$. 

Given that $E(n, k) = \infty$ when it's impossible to escape, we should focus on the cases where $E(n, k) \neq \infty$. We can start by considering the case when $k = 1$, as this is the simplest scenario. If $k = 1$, then $E(n, 1)$ is the number of minutes required to turn on all $n$ switches, which is $n$ minutes. Thus, $I(n, 1) = n - \frac{n}{1} = 0$ for all $n > 2$. This doesn't help us, so we need to consider other values of $k$.

Next, let's consider $k = 2$. If $k = 2$, then $E(n, 2)$ is the minimum number of minutes required to turn on all $n$ switches by flipping 2 switches each minute. For $n = 4$, $E(4, 2) = 2$ because flipping 2 switches per minute, in 2 minutes, she can turn on all 4 switches. Thus, $I(4, 2) = 2 - \frac{4}{2} = 0$. Again, this doesn't help, so we need to consider other values of $k$.

Because $n$ is even, and because each switch must be flipped an odd number of times in order to escape, the total number of flips is even. Because $k$ must be odd, $E(n, k)$ must be even. To show this, consider the case where $E(n, k)$ is odd. If $E(n, k)$ is odd, then an odd number of flips happen an odd number of times, resulting in an odd number of total flips. This is a contradiction because $n$ is even.

Call a switch ""non-flipped"" in any given minute if it is not among the switches flipped in that minute. Because $E(n, k)$ (i.e., the total number of minutes) is even, and each switch is flipped an odd number of times, each switch must also be non-flipped an odd number of times. Therefore any sequence of flips that solves the "" $(n, k)$ puzzle"" can be made into a sequence of flips that solves the "" $(n, n-k)$ "" puzzle by interchanging flips and non-flips. These sequences last for the same number of minutes, and therefore $E(n, k)=E(n, n-k)$.


Let $n=2 x$ and $k=2 x-1$ for some positive integer $x$. Then $n$ is even and $k$ is odd, so the above prove applies, and $E(n, k)=E(n, n-k)=E(n, 1)=2 x$. Therefore $I(n, k)=2 x-\frac{2 x}{2 x-1}$. Because $x>2$, it follows that $\frac{2 x}{2 x-1}<2<x$, so $I(n, k)>x$, as desired.",0,False,4466
