(2) ... </answer>. Here is my question,
    
    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Harper, Benjamin, Olivia, Daniel, Henry, Jackson, and Sebastian. According to Harper, ""Sebastian is a knave if and only if Henry is a knight"". Benjamin asserted: ""Henry is a knight if and only if Olivia is a knight"". Olivia commented, ""Benjamin is a knave and Daniel is a knave"". Daniel stated, ""Jackson is a knave"". Henry told you that Olivia is not a knight. Jackson said that Harper is a knight and Benjamin is a knight. Sebastian told you that Daniel is a knight and Jackson is a knight. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Harper: ""Sebastian is a knave if and only if Henry is a knight.""
     This statement means that Sebastian is a knave if Henry is a knight, which is the same as saying that Sebastian is a knight if Henry is a knave.
     Benjamin: ""Henry is a knight if and only if Olivia is a knight.""
     This statement means that Henry and Olivia have the same trait; if Henry is a knight, then Olivia is a knight, and if Henry is a knave, then Olivia is a knave.
     Olivia: ""Benjamin is a knave and Daniel is a knave.""
     This is a contradiction because Benjamin cannot be a knave based on Benjamin's previous statement. Therefore, Olivia is a knave.
     Henry: ""Jackson is a knave.""
     Since Olivia is a knave, Henry's statement must be true, so Jackson is a knave.
     Benjamin: ""Henry is a knight if and only if Olivia is a knight.""
     Since Olivia is a knave, this statement must be false, so Henry must be a knave.
     Daniel: ""Jackson is a knave.""
     Since Jackson is a knave, this statement must be true, so Daniel is a knight.
     Henry: ""Olivia is not a knight.""
     Since Olivia is a knave, this statement must be true, so Henry is a knave.
     Jackson: ""Harper is a knight and Benjamin is a knight.""
     Harper cannot be a knight as per Harper's original statement, so Jackson is a knave.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Owen, Abigail, Aiden, Zoey, Jack, Ava, and Harper. Owen stated, ""Zoey is not a knight"". Abigail noted, ""Harper is a knave"". Aiden asserted: ""Zoey is not a knight"". Zoey expressed that If Jack is a knight then Abigail is a knight. As Jack put it, ""Zoey is a knave"". Ava said, ""Jack is a knight if and only if Harper is a knave."" ""Aiden is a knave"" - Harper. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Owen stated, ""Zoey is not a knight"".
        This statement is contradicted by Aiden's later statement that Zoey asserted that If Jack is a knight then Abigail is a knight. Since Jack is not a knight  (as claimed by Aiden), this means that Abigail is a knave.
        Harper claimed: ""Aiden is a knave""
        This is true since Aiden is the one who asserted that Zoey is not a knight.
        Zoey expressed that If Jack is a knight then Abigail is a knight.
        Since Jack is a knave  (as claimed by Harper), Zoey's claim is true.
        Harper claimed: ""Aiden is a knave""
        This is true since Aiden is the one who asserted that Zoey is not a knight.
        Jack put it, ""Zoey is a knave"".
        This is false since Zoey is the one who asserted that If Jack is a knight then Abigail is a knight, and since Zoey is a knight  (as claimed by everyone else), this means that Abigail is a knave.

    Ava: Ava is a knight.  Ava's statement that Ava is a knight if and only if Isabella is a knave is false, since Ava is a knight and Isabella is a knight.
    Evelyn: Evelyn is a knight.  Grace mentioned that if Grace is a knave then Ava is a knave, but Ava is a knight, so Grace must be a knight.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Alexander, Avery, Riley, Chloe, Jack, Emily, and Jacob. Alexander asserted: ""If Avery is a knight then Jacob is a knight"". Avery asserted: ""Emily is a knight and Avery is a knight"". Riley expressed that Avery is a knave and Emily is a knight. Chloe noted, ""Avery is not a knave"". Jack was heard saying, ""Jacob is not a knave"". Emily remarked, ""Chloe is a knight if and only if Chloe is a knave"". Jacob commented, ""Alexander is a knight or Jack is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Alexander asserted: ""If Avery is a knight then Jacob is a knight"".
    Avery asserted: ""Emily is a knight and Avery is a knight"".
    Avery is a knight because Avery's assertion ""Emily is a knight and Avery is a knight"" is true, since Avery is a knight and Emily is a knight by Avery's own assertion.
    Since Avery is a knight, Jacob is a knight as well, as asserted by Alexander.
    Emily remarked, ""Chloe is a knight if and only if Chloe is a knave"".
    This assertion is a contradiction, so Emily is a knave.
    Riley expressed that Avery is a knave and Emily is a knight.
    This is false (since Emily is a knave), so Riley is a knave.
    Chloe noted, ""Avery is not a knave"".
    Since Avery is a knight (as we could see from Avery's first assertion), Chloe is a knight.
    Jack was heard saying, ""Jacob is not a knave"".
    Since Jacob is a knight (as we could see from Alexander's and Chloe's assertions), Jack is a knight.
    Riley asserted, ""Emily is a knave"".
    Since Emily is a knave (as we could see from Emily's assertion), Riley is a knight.

     Since Mia is a knight, Ella must be a knight since the condition did not happen.
     So, Ella is a knight.

    Luke stated, ""Mia is a knave or Chloe is a knight"".
    Since Mia is a knight, Chloe must be a knight.
    Owen said, ""Mia is not a knight"".
    But we have already determined that Mia is a knight, causing this statement to be false, so Owen is a knave.
    Sebastian's statement was ""Luke is a knave or Chloe is a knave"".
    Since Chloe is a knight, the first option (Luke is a knave) is true, so Sebastian is a knight.
    Mia's statement was ""Owen is a knave"".

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Abigail, Jackson, Penelope, Aurora, Henry, Evelyn, and Ella. Abigail asserted: ""If Jackson is a knight then Aurora is a knave"". Jackson said, ""Penelope is a knight if and only if Abigail is a knave."" Penelope expressed that Evelyn is not a knight. As Aurora put it, ""Penelope is a knight and Henry is a knave"". Henry noted, ""Ella is not a knight"". Evelyn noted, ""If Evelyn is a knight then Ella is a knave"". ""Abigail is not a knight"" - Ella. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Abigail asserted: ""If Jackson is a knight then Aurora is a knave"".
    If Jackson is a Knight, Aurora is a Knave.
    If Jackson is a Knave, Aurora is a Knight.
    Jackson said, ""Penelope is a knight if and only if Abigail is a knave"".
    If Jackson is a Knight, Penelope is a Knave.
    If Jackson is a Knave, Penelope is a Knight.
    Penelope expressed that Evelyn is not a knight.
    If Penelope is a Knight, Evelyn is a Knave.
    If Penelope is a Knave, Evelyn is a Knight.
    Aurora put it, ""Penelope is a knight and Henry is a knave"".
    If Aurora is a Knight, Penelope is a Knight and Henry is a Knave.
    If Aurora is a Knave, Penelope is a Knave or Henry is a Knight.
    Ella noted, ""Abigail is not a knight"".
    If Ella is a Knight, Abigail is a Knave.
    If Ella is a Knave, Abigail is a Knight.
    Evelyn noted, ""If Evelyn is a knight then Ella is a knave"".
    If Evelyn is a Knight, Ella is a Knave.
    If Evelyn is a Knave, Ella is a Knight.
    Since Penelope asserted that Evelyn is not a knight, Penelope must be a Knave (because Evelyn cannot be a Knight, since Penelope claimed she is not a knight).
    Since Penelope is a Knave, Penelope's claim that Evelyn is not a knight must be false, so Evelyn must be a Knight.
    Since Evelyn is a Knight, Ella's claim that Abigail is not a knight must be false, so Abigail must be a Knight.
    Since Abigail is a Knight, Jackson must be a Knight, so Aurora must be a Knave.
    Since Aurora is a Knave, Henry must be a Knight, so Ella must be a Knave.
    Since Ella is a Knave, Evelyn's claim that Ella is not a knight must be true, so Ella must be a Knave.
    Since Ella is a Knave, Abigail's claim that Aurora is a Knave must be true, so Aurora must be a Knave.
    Since Aurora is a Knave, Jackson's claim that Penelope is a Knave must be true, so Penelope must be a Knight.
    Since Penelope is a Knight, Henry's claim that Ella is not a knight must be false, so Ella must be a Knight, but we already decided Ella is a Knave, which is a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that Aurora is a Knight must be false, so Aurora must be a Knave.
    Since Aurora is a Knave, Henry's claim that Ella is not a knight must be true, so Ella must be a Knave.
    Since Ella is a Knave, Evelyn's claim that Ella is not a knight must be true, so Ella must be a Knight, but we already decided Ella is a Knave, which is a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that Evelyn is a Knight must be false, so Evelyn must be a Knave.
    Since Evelyn is a Knave, Abigail's claim that Aurora is a Knave must be false, so Aurora must be a Knight.
    Since Aurora is a Knight, Jackson's claim that Penelope is a Knight must be true, so Penelope must be a Knight.
    Since Penelope is a Knight, Ella's claim that Ella is a Knave must be false, so Ella must be a Knight.
    Since Ella is a Knight, Henry's claim that Ella is a Knave must be false, so Ella must be a Knight.

In Alexander's words: ""If Harper is a knight then Luke is a knave"". Luke remarked, ""Alexander is a knave and Alexander is a knight"". Charlotte expressed that Luke is a knight. ""Alexander is a knight,"" Harper mentioned. Benjamin said that Luke is a knave and Alexander is a knave. Jacob stated, ""Charlotte is a knight or Benjamin is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Aria: Aria is a knight because her statement is true since there are at least two knights (Aria and Benjamin).
    Alexander: Alexander is a knave because if Harper were a knight, then Luke would be a knave, but Alexander stated that Luke is a knave, and this is a contradiction since Alexander claimed that if Harper were a knight, then Luke would be a knave.
    Luke: Luke is a knave because he claims both that Alexander is a knave and that Alexander is a knight, which is a contradiction.
    Charlotte: Charlotte is a knight because Luke claimed that Alexander is a knight, but we determined that Luke is a knave, so Alexander must be a knave, and Charlotte's statement is true.
    Harper: Harper is a knight because Alexander claimed that he is a knight, and Charlotte confirmed that Alexander is a knight.

    Jackson: Jacob is a knight if and only if Sebastian is a knight. (Joseph is a knave, so this statement is true, and therefore Jackson is a knight)
    Aurora: Michael is a knight. (This has been established as true)

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Harper, Emma, Mia, Luke, Alexander, David, and Ethan. As Harper put it, ""David is not a knight"". In Emma's words: ""David is a knight"". Mia said that If Emma is a knight then Emma is a knave. Luke said, ""If Alexander is a knave then Emma is a knight."" Alexander was heard saying, ""If David is a knight then Harper is a knave"". ""Alexander is not a knight"" - David. ""Harper is a knight,"" Ethan mentioned. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Harper: David is not a knight.
     Emma: David is a knight.
     Mia: If Emma is a knight then Emma is a knave.
     Luke: If Alexander is a knave then Emma is a knight.
     Alexander: If David is a knight then Harper is a knave.
     David: Alexander is not a knight.
     Ethan: Harper is a knight.
    David says Alexander is not a knight, but Alexander claimed that if David is a knight, then Harper is a knave. Since David is a knave (he lies), Alexander must also be a knave.
    Mia's statement contains a conditional statement ""if Emma is a knight then Emma is a knave"". For this statement to be true, Emma must be a knave because in case Emma is a knight, then the conclusion ""Emma is a knave"" would be false, and Mia would be lying, but Mia tells the truth, so Emma must be a knave.
    Mia claims that Emma is a knave, but Emma actually is a knight (David lied), this means that Mia is a knave.
    Since Alexander's statement is a conditional statement ""if David is a knight then Harper is a knave"", and David is a knave, the statement above is true regardless of Harper, so Alexander must be a knight.
    Ethan claims that Harper is a knight, but we've established that Harper is a knave, so Ethan is a knave.
    Luke's statement is a conditional statement ""if Alexander is a knave then Emma is a knight"", Alexander is a knight, so the ""if"" part of the statement is false, and conditional statements with false first parts are always true, no matter what the second part is, so Luke is a knight.
    Emma is a knight.

     True, since Lucas said that Ella is a knave or Chloe is a knave, and Lucas told the truth, then Chloe must be a knave.
     Lucas: ""Ella is a knave or Chloe is a knave""
     True, since Ella said that Ethan is a knave or Olivia is a knave, and we determined that Olivia is a knight and Ethan is a knave, then Chloe must be a knave.
     Olivia: ""Lucas is a knight and Chloe is a knight""
     True, since Lucas told the truth and Chloe is a knave as we determined.
     Chloe: ""If William is a knight then Avery is a knight""
     True, since we know that William is a knave, and a knave can falsify any implication.
     Avery: ""If Lucas is a knave then Lucas is a knight""
     True, since Lucas told the truth, and a knight cannot be a knave.
     William: ""Chloe is a knight and Ethan is a knave""
     False, since we determined that Chloe is a knave, and Ethan is a knave as per his own statement.

     False, since Chloe is a knave, and Lucas must be a knight as per Lucas's statement.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Charlotte, Victoria, Jackson, Henry, Ella, James, and Matthew. Charlotte stated, ""Victoria is a knave or James is a knave"". According to Victoria, ""Henry is not a knave"". Jackson said that Victoria is a knight. According to Henry, ""If Henry is a knight then Jackson is a knight"". Ella expressed that Matthew is a knave. James told you that Charlotte is a knight and Ella is a knave. In Matthew's words: ""Henry is a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Charlotte stated, ""Victoria is a knave or James is a knave"".
    Victoria claimed, ""Henry is not a knave"".
    Since Victoria claimed Henry is not a knave, Victoria believes Henry is a knight.
    According to Henry, ""If Henry is a knight then Jackson is a knight"".
    Since Henry asserted that if he is a knight, then Jackson is a knight, and Victoria asserted that Henry is a knight, it follows that Jackson is a knight.
    Ella expressed that Matthew is a knave, but Matthew claimed that Henry is a knave.
    Since Ella claimed Matthew is a knave, Ella believes Matthew is a knave.
    However, since Matthew claimed Henry is a knave, and Henry believes that if he is a knight, then Jackson is a knight, it follows that Henry must be a knave (since Matthew claimed Henry is a knave).
    James told you that Charlotte is a knight and Ella is a knave.
    Since Charlotte is a knight (as can be deduced from the above arguments), but Ella is a knave, James is a knave.
    Finally, since Matthew is a knave, his claim that Henry is a knave must be false, and thus Henry must be a knight.

    Sebastian asserted: ""If Zoey is a knave then Ethan is a knave"".

    This is a contradiction, so Emma is a knave.
    Evelyn's words: ""Sebastian is a knave"".
    But we concluded that Sebastian is a knight, so Evelyn is a knave.
    Zoey was heard saying, ""If Emma is a knight then Samuel is a knave"".
    Since Emma is a knave, this statement is equivalent to ""If Emma is a knave then Samuel is a knave"", which is a true statement, so Zoey is a knight.
    Samuel said, ""Evelyn is a knight or Sebastian is a knave"".

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Alexander, Noah, Benjamin, Abigail, Jackson, Michael, and Sophia. Alexander asserted: ""Abigail is a knave or Noah is a knave"". Noah said, ""Abigail is a knave and Benjamin is a knight."" Benjamin remarked, ""Michael is not a knight"". Abigail was heard saying, ""Michael is a knight if and only if Sophia is a knight"". In a statement by Jackson: ""Noah is not a knight"". Michael stated, ""Alexander is a knave if and only if Sophia is a knave"". In Sophia's words: ""Alexander is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Noah said, ""Abigail is a knave and Benjamin is a knight.""
     This is a contradiction because Noah assumed Benjamin to be a knight but said that he is a knave.
    Therefore, Noah is a knave.
    
    Noah said, ""Abigail is a knave and Benjamin is a knight.""
    Since Noah is a knave, his first part, Noah's knavehood, is true, so Abigail is a knave.
    Since Noah is a knave, his second part, Benjamin's knavehood, is false, so Benjamin is a knave.
    
    Alexander asserted: ""Abigail is a knave or Noah is a knave"".
    Since Abigail is a knave and Noah is a knave, both parts of the disjunction are true, so Alexander told the truth and is a knight.
    
    Benjamin remarked, ""Michael is not a knight"".
    Since Benjamin is a knave, his part, Michael's knavehood, is true, so Michael is a knave.
    
    Jackson made a statement: ""Noah is not a knight"".
    Since Noah is a knave, his part, Noah's knavehood, is true, so Jackson's statement is true and Jackson is a knight.
    
    Abigail was heard saying, ""Michael is a knight if and only if Sophia is a knight"".
    Since Michael is a knave, his part, Michael's knavehood, is true, so Sophia must be a knave.
    But this contradicts with Abigail's statement, so Abigail is a knave.

William noted, ""Ella is a knave or Lucas is a knight"". Penelope asserted: ""William is a knave"". Jack expressed that If Penelope is a knave then William is a knight. Lucas told you that Ella is a knave if and only if Jacob is a knave. Grace remarked, ""Penelope is a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Ella claimed that Penelope is a knave and Lucas is a knave.
     However, if Penelope is a knave, then Penelope is telling the truth in the statement ""Penelope is a knave"", which is a contradiction.
    Therefore Ella is a knave.
    Jacob remarked that Jacob is a knight and Grace is a knave.
    But Jacob cannot be a knight since Jacob claimed that Grace is a knave, but Jacob is a knight.
    So Jacob is a knave.
    William noted that Ella is a knave or Lucas is a knight.
    Since Ella is a knave, then Lucas must be a knight for this to be true.
    Penelope asserted that William is a knave.
    Since William is a knight as we determined, Penelope is a knave.
    Jack expressed that if Penelope is a knave then William is a knight.
    Since Penelope is a knave, William's statement simplifies to ""if a knave is a knave, then a knight is a knight"", which is a true statement.
    Lucas told you that Ella is a knave if and only if Jacob is a knave.
    Ella claimed that Lucas is a knave, but we determined that Lucas is a knight, so Jacob must be a knight.
    Grace remarked that Penelope is a knave.
    This is true based on our determination of who Penelope is.

""Aurora is a knight if and only if Ella is a knight,"" Alexander declared. In William's words: ""Henry is not a knight"". In Aurora's words: ""Ella is a knight and Victoria is a knave"". Victoria remarked, ""Ella is a knight if and only if William is a knight"". Sebastian expressed that Victoria is a knave. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Henry said that Ella is a knave.
    If Henry is a knight, then Ella is a knave – a contradiction.
    Therefore, Henry is a knave.
    Ella claims that ""If Henry is a knave then William is a knight.""
    Since Henry is a knave, Ella's condition is ""If this false statement then William is a knight"", or equivalently ""William is a knight"".
    So Ella is a knight.
    Alexander said that ""Aurora is a knight if and only if Ella is a knight"".
    Since Ella is a knight, Aurora is a knight.
    Therefore, Alexander is a knight.
    William claims that Henry is not a knight.
    But we concluded that Henry is a knave.
    Therefore, William is a knight.
    Aurora claims that ""Ella is a knight and Victoria is a knave"".
    But we concluded that Ella is a knight.
    Therefore, Aurora is a knave.
    Victoria claimed that ""Ella is a knight if and only if William is a knight"".

    "," Aurora: ""Jack is a knave and Daniel is a knave.""

     Daniel: ""Aurora is a knight.""
    This is a lie since Aurora claimed that both Jack and Daniel are knaves, but we concluded that Aurora is a knave.
     Therefore, Aurora is a knave.
     Liam: ""Penelope is a knave.""
    This is a truth since Aurora claimed that both Jack and Daniel are knaves, and Penelope is one of them.
    Therefore, Liam is a knight.
    Jack: ""If Penelope is a knight then Liam is a knave.""
    Since Penelope is a knight and Liam is a knight, it means that Jack is a knight, but this contradicts the statement that Jack made. Therefore, Jack's statement was a lie, which means Penelope is not a knight, which means Penelope is a knave.

    This claim is false, since Jack is a knight and Olivia is a knave. So Jack must be a knave.

    Jack is a knave, so Jack's claim that Olivia is a knave must be false, which means that Evelyn is not a knave. Therefore, Evelyn must be a knight.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Jackson, Lucas, Jacob, Matthew, Evelyn, Elizabeth, and Alexander. Jackson was heard saying, ""If Evelyn is a knave then Jackson is a knight"". Lucas expressed that Alexander is a knave and Elizabeth is a knight. Jacob commented, ""Alexander is a knight"". In Matthew's words: ""Evelyn is a knight and Alexander is a knight"".

    This statement must be true, since Evelyn is a knave, therefore Jackson is a knight.

    This is a contradiction, since we already know that Jackson, who is a knight, said that Alexander is a knight.

    Since Evelyn claimed that Matthew is not a knight, and if Matthew were a knight, then so would be Evelyn, this means that Matthew is a knave.
    Elizabeth, who claims that Jacob is a knave, is telling the truth, since Lucas claimed that Jacob is a knave, and Lucas is a knave.
    Alexander remarked, ""Matthew is a knight and Evelyn is a knave"".
    Since Matthew is a knave, this statement must be false, therefore Alexander is a knave.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Mason, Alexander, Liam, Lily, Ava, Logan, and Sophia. In Mason's words: ""Alexander is a knave"". Alexander stated, ""Liam is a knave if and only if Ava is a knight"". Liam noted, ""Alexander is a knave or Sophia is a knave"". According to Lily, ""If Sophia is a knave then Mason is a knave"". Ava expressed that Liam is a knave. Logan said that Sophia is a knave and Liam is a knave. Sophia commented, ""Logan is not a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Alexander stated, ""Liam is a knave if and only if Ava is a knight"".
    Alexander lied, therefore Ava must be a knight since Liam is a knave.
    Liam noted, ""Alexander is a knave or Sophia is a knave"".
    Since Alexander is a knave, Liam is telling the truth, and Sophia must be a knave.
    Lily expressed that if Sophia is a knave then Mason is a knave. Since Sophia is a knave, Mason must be a knave.
    Mason claimed that Alexander is a knave. Since Alexander is a knave, Mason is telling the truth, and his claim is true.
    Ava claimed that Liam is a knave. Since Liam is a knave, Ava is telling the truth, and her claim is true.
    Logan claimed that Sophia is a knave and Liam is a knave. Since Sophia is a knave, but Liam is a knave, the first part of the claim is true, while the second part is false. Since Logan lied, his claim must be false, which means at least one of the two events is untrue - Sophia is not a knave, and Liam is not a knight.
    Sophia claimed that Logan is not a knight. Since Logan is a knave, Sophia is lying, and her claim is false.

(2) ... </answer>. Here is my question,
    
    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Jacob, Daniel, Aria, Jack, Isabella, Benjamin, and James. ""Daniel is a knight,"" Jacob mentioned. Daniel commented, ""James is a knave and James is a knight"". In Aria's words: ""Daniel is a knight if and only if Jacob is a knave"". Jack said, ""If Aria is a knight then Jacob is a knight."" According to Isabella, ""Daniel is a knave"". ""Jack is a knight if and only if Aria is a knave"" - Benjamin. James stated, ""If Benjamin is a knight then Jack is a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Daniel commented, ""James is a knave and James is a knight"".
    This is a contradiction, so Daniel is a knave.
    James stated, ""If Benjamin is a knight then Jack is a knave"".
    Since Benjamin said that Jack is a knight if Aria is a knave (Aria's statement: ""Daniel is a knight if and only if Jacob is a knave""), and since Daniel is a knave, it follows that Jacob is a knight (by the first sentence of Jacob's statement). Therefore, James' sentence is valid, so Jack must be a knight.
    Aria's statement is ""Daniel is a knight if and only if Jacob is a knave"".
    But we know Daniel is a knave, so Aria's statement simplifies to ""Daniel is a knight if and only if Jacob is a knave"", or in other words, ""A knight is a knave"", which is a contradiction. So, Aria is a knave.
    Jacob mentioned, ""Daniel is a knight"".
    But we know Daniel is a knave, so Jacob's statement is a lie, which means Jacob is a knave.
    Benjamin said, ""Jack is a knight if and only if Aria is a knave"".
    But we know Aria is a knave, so Benjamin's statement simplifies to ""Jack is a knight if and only if Aria is a knave"", which is the same as ""Jack is a knight if and only if a knave is a knight"", which is a contradiction. So, Benjamin is a knave.
    So, Jacob is a knave, Aria is a knave, Benjamin is a knave, and Daniel is a knave.
    James stated, ""If Benjamin is a knight then Jack is a knave"".
    But Benjamin is a knave, so the condition (Benjamin is a knight) is false, which means the entire sentence (If Benjamin is a knight then Jack is a knave) is true, regardless of the truth value of Jack. So, James could be either a knight or a knave.

Michael asserted: ""Owen is not a knight"". ""Daniel is a knight if and only if Sofia is a knight,"" Ethan mentioned. ""Daniel is a knight if and only if Michael is a knight"" - Sofia. So who is a knight and who is a knave?

    "," Sophia asserted: ""Owen is a knight and Owen is a knave"".
    This is a contradiction, so Sophia is a knave.

    Since Sophia is a knave, the sumtion before the ""or"" is true, so Michael must be a knight.
    Owen claimed: ""Sofia is a knave if and only if Ethan is a knight"".
    Since Sofia is a knave, the ""if"" part is empty, so the ""only if"" part must be true, thus Ethan is a knight.

    Since Sofia is a knight, the statement before the ""not"" is false, so the statement as a whole is true, and Daniel must be a knight.
    Michael asserted: ""Owen is not a knight"".

Chloe stated, ""Riley is a knight and Henry is a knight"". Daniel said that If Luke is a knave then Daniel is a knight. Riley expressed that Mia is not a knave.

""Owen is a knave,"" Ava claimed. William was heard saying, ""Aria is a knight and William is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Emma noted, ""Owen is a knight if and only if Sebastian is a knave"".
    This is a contradiction, because Owen claimed to be a knight, so Sebastian must be a knave.
    Ava claimed that Owen is a knight, but Sebastian claimed the opposite, so Ava is a knave.
    Alexander noted, ""Ava is a knight and William is a knave"".
    But Ava is a knave, so the first part of the claim is false, and the whole statement is true, so Alexander is a knight.
    Emma noted, ""Owen is a knight if and only if Sebastian is a knave"".
    But we know that Sebastian is a knave, so this statement is true, and Emma is a knight.
    Owen put it, ""Ava is a knight and Emma is a knight"".
    But we know that Ava is a knave, so this statement is false, and Owen is a knave.
    William was heard saying, ""Aria is a knight and William is a knight"".
    But we know that William is a knight, so this statement is true, and Aria is a knight.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

Penelope was heard saying, ""Penelope is a knight if and only if Evelyn is a knight"". Sophia was heard saying, ""Penelope is a knight"". Logan commented, ""If Logan is a knight then Amelia is a knave"". Evelyn noted, ""If Amelia is a knave then Penelope is a knight"". ""Penelope is a knave if and only if Sophia is a knight,"" Amelia mentioned. Riley noted, ""Amelia is a knight if and only if Evelyn is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?

    Amelia says: ""Penelope is a knave if and only if Sophia is a knight.""
    Riley says: ""Amelia is a knight if and only if Evelyn is a knight.""
    Logan's statement is false because Sophia said that Penelope is a knight and he claims that Amelia is a knave. Since Logan's statement is false, Logan must be a knave.
    Amelia's statement is true because Sophia is a knight and Penelope is a knight.
    Penelope's statement is true because she is a knight and Evelyn is a knight.
    Sophia's statement is true because she is a knight and Penelope is a knight.
    Evelyn's statement is true because Amelia is a knave and Penelope is a knight, which satisfies the condition.
    Benjamin's statement is false because Sophia is a knight but Amelia is a knight, so this statement is claiming that Amelia is a knave, which is a lie. Therefore, Benjamin must be a knave.
    Riley's statement is true because Evelyn is a knight and Amelia is a knight.

    "," Ethan said that If Jacob is a knave then Amelia is a knight.
    This is equivalent to saying If Jacob is a knave, Amelia is a knight. Since Amelia told the truth (truthful statement), Amelia must be a knight, and Jacob a knight.
    Noah made a true statement, since Jack is a knight, and Amelia is a knight, so Jack must be a knight.
    Daniel said that Charlotte's statement is true, but Charlotte's statement is a disjunction, so at least one part of it must be true. Since Amelia is a knight, Charlotte must be a knight.

    Oliver asserted: ""If Charlotte is a knave then Abigail is a knight"".
    We don't know Charlotte's truth value, so this statement by Oliver is not proven or disproven by Oliver's assertion.

    Charlotte said that James is a knight if and only if Daniel is a knight.

According to Zoey, ""Amelia is a knight"". William commented, ""Amelia is a knave"". Joseph was heard saying, ""William is a knight and Jacob is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Amelia told you that Jacob is a knave.
    But Jacob said: ""If Amelia is a knight then Zoey is a knight"".
    If Amelia is a knave, the condition of Jacob's sentence is satisfied (Amelia isn't a knight), and its conclusion is true (Zoey is a knight, it doesn't matter since the conclusion is true). So Jacob must be a knight.
    Since Jacob is a knight, Amelia's assertion that he is a knave must be false, so Amelia is a knave.
    Zoey claimed: ""Amelia is a knight"".
    But we've just decided that Amelia is a knave.
    So Zoey is a knave.
    Ella stated: ""Joseph is a knave"".
    But Joseph said: ""William is a knight and Jacob is a knight"".
    Since Jacob is a knight, Joseph must be a knight.
    So Ella is a knave.
    William commented: ""Amelia is a knave"".
    We've already decided Amelia is a knave, so William is telling the truth, and he must be a knight.
    Joseph said: ""William is a knight and Jacob is a knight"".
    We've decided Jacob is a knight and William is a knight, so Joseph is telling the truth and he must be a knight.

    Elizabeth said, ""Mason is a knight"", but Mason said that if Jacob were a knight, Elizabeth would be a knave. Since Jacob cannot be a knight  (because then Elizabeth would be a knave, which contradicts Elizabeth being a knight), Jacob must be a knave.
    Jacob claimed, ""Mason is a knight if and only if Abigail is a knave"", but we determined that Abigail is a knave. This is consistent, since Jacob's claim would be true in this case.
    Chloe asserted: ""James is a knave or Abigail is a knight"". But we determined that James is a knight, so Abigail must be a knight, and Chloe's statement is consistent.
    Riley commented, ""Mason is a knight or Riley is a knight"". Since Mason is a knight, Riley's statement is consistent.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

""William is a knave or William is a knight"" - Elizabeth. William asserted: ""Luke is a knight and Elizabeth is a knight"". In a statement by Mason: ""Charlotte is not a knight"". Samuel told you that Charlotte is not a knave. Luke said, ""If Charlotte is a knave then Mia is a knight."" Mia stated, ""Samuel is a knight and Elizabeth is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Charlotte's statement is a contradiction because no one can be both a knight and a knave at the same time.
    Elizabeth's statement is true because William is an inhabitant, so he is either a knight or a knave.

    Mason's statement is true because Charlotte lied, so she is a knave.

     This is a true statement because Henry is either a knight or a knave.

    This is true because Jacob told the truth and Henry is a knight and Sebastian is a knight as we learned before.
    Grace was heard saying, ""Owen is a knave if and only if Jacob is a knave"".
    Since Jacob is a knight (as we determined), this statement is true because it's ""Owen is a knave if and only if Jacob is a knave"" and Jacob is not a knave, so none is a knave.

    "," Sofia remarked, ""Joseph is not a knight"".
    If Sofia is telling the truth, then Joseph must be a knave.
    But if Joseph is a knave, then Sofia is also telling the truth, which means Sofia must be a knight.

    Therefore, Sofia is a knave.
    Matthew declared, ""Joseph is not a knave"".
    Since Sofia claimed that Joseph is a knave, it means that Joseph must be a knight.
    This statement is true because we have already determined that Joseph is a knight.

    Ava was heard saying, ""If Joseph is a knight then Joseph is a knave"".
    Since we determined that Joseph is a knight, this statement means that Joseph is a knave.
    This is a contradiction.
    Therefore, Ava is a knave.
    Riley told you that If Sofia is a knight then Joseph is a knave.
    Since Sofia is a knave, this statement is true.

    Joseph told you that ""Chloe is a knave if and only if Riley is a knave"".

Amelia said that Olivia is a knave or Aria is a knave. Benjamin noted, ""Ava is a knave and Amelia is a knave"". Aria remarked, ""Ava is a knave"". ""Benjamin is a knight and Aria is a knave,"" Mia claimed. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Olivia said: ""Ava is a knight and Amelia is a knave.""
     But Samuel said: ""Benjamin is a knave.""
     If Olivia is telling the truth, then Benjamin should be a knave, but Samuel claimed that Benjamin is a knave. They are contradicting each other.
     So Olivia is a knave.
     Ava said: ""If Samuel is a knight then Olivia is a knave.""
     Since Olivia is a knave, then the condition (Samuel is a knight) is false because all knights tell the truth. Ava's sentence with a false condition is technically true (because a false condition implies a true result in a conditional sentence). So Ava is telling the truth, which means that Samuel is a knight.
     Amelia said that Olivia is a knave or Aria is a knave.
     We determined that Olivia is a knave, so the first part of the OR is true. Since Aria is a knave as well, Amelia is telling the truth.
     Benjamin said: ""Ava is a knave and Amelia is a knave.""
     But Ava and Amelia both told the truth, so Benjamin is lying, which means he is a knave.
     Mia said: ""Benjamin is a knight and Aria is a knave.""
     But Benjamin is a knave, so the first part of the AND is false, and since a false condition combined with anything results in false, Mia is lying, which means she is a knave.

    Assistant: <think>
    "," Victoria claimed: ""If Alexander is a knave then Zoey is a knight.""
    If the condition of Victoria's claim is met, then Zoey must be a knight, since Victoria always tells the truth. Therefore, Zoey is a knight.

    Samuel put it: ""Aiden is a knave if and only if Riley is a knight.""
    This is equivalent to saying: ""Aiden is a knight if and only if Riley is a knave.""
    We know from Alexander's statement that Riley is not a knave, therefore Aiden must be a knight.

    Aiden claimed: ""If Zoey is a knave then Riley is a knave,""
    Since Zoey is a knight as determined from Victoria, the condition of Aiden's statement is not met, therefore we can't conclude anything about Riley's identity.

    Joseph noted: ""Zoey is a knave.""
    But we determined that Zoey is a knight, therefore Joseph lied, so he must be a knave.

    Riley stated: ""Alexander is not a knave.""
    Since Alexander is a real person, he must be a knight, so Riley told the truth and must be a knight.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 6 inhabitants: Isabella, Avery, Grace, Ava, Scarlett, and Evelyn. As Isabella put it, ""Ava is a knight or Ava is a knave"". Avery commented, ""Grace is a knight"". According to Grace, ""If Ava is a knave then Evelyn is a knight"". Ava was heard saying, ""Avery is not a knight"". Scarlett noted, ""Isabella is a knave or Evelyn is a knave"". ""If Ava is a knight then Scarlett is a knave"" - Evelyn. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Isabella said: ""Ava is a knight or Ava is a knave"".
    This is a statement that is always true, as Ava must be either a knight or a knave.
    Avery said: ""Grace is a knight"".
    This must be true as Avery told the truth.
    Grace said: ""If Ava is a knave then Evelyn is a knight"".
    Since Ava said that she is a knave, Grace's statement reduces to ""Evelyn is a knight"", which must be true because of Avery's statement.
    Ava said: ""Avery is not a knight"".
    This must be false as Avery told the truth.
    Therefore, Ava is a knave.
    Evelyn said: ""If Ava is a knight then Scarlett is a knave"".

    Scarlett said: ""Isabella is a knave or Evelyn is a knave"".

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 6 inhabitants: Lucas, Owen, Olivia, Ella, Ethan, and William. Lucas expressed that Lucas is a knight or Olivia is a knave. Owen remarked, ""If Ella is a knave then Lucas is a knave"". ""Ethan is a knight"" - Olivia. Ella was heard saying, ""If Lucas is a knight then Owen is a knight"". ""If Lucas is a knight then William is a knight,"" Ethan declared. ""Ethan is a knave,"" William mentioned. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Lucas expressed that Lucas is a knight or Olivia is a knave.
    This is a true statement since Lucas is a knight and Olivia is a knave.
    Owen remarked, ""If Ella is a knave then Lucas is a knave"".
    This statement is true since Ella cannot be a knave (we know Olivia told the truth when she said that Ethan is a knight), therefore the condition ""Ella is a knave"" is not met, and we don't care what Lucas is.
    Olivia told us that ""Ethan is a knight"".
    We know from Ethan's statement that ""If Lucas is a knight then Ethan is a knight"", and since Lucas is a knight, Ethan is a knight.
    Ella claimed that ""If Lucas is a knight then Owen is a knight"".
    We know Lucas is a knight, and Owen is a knight, therefore Ella told the truth.
    Ethan declared that ""If Lucas is a knight then William is a knight"".
    We know Lucas is a knight, but William is a knave, therefore Ethan lied, and he must be a knave.
    William claimed that ""Ethan is a knave"".
    We know from above that Ethan is a knave, so William told the truth, and he must be a knight.

In a statement by Aurora: ""Alexander is not a knave"". Riley told you that If Aurora is a knave then Oliver is a knight. Ethan asserted: ""Sebastian is a knave"". Sebastian commented, ""If Ethan is a knave then Sebastian is a knight"". In Alexander's words: ""Sebastian is a knave if and only if Oliver is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Oliver said: ""Riley is a knave and Aurora is a knave"".
    This is a contradiction because Aurora made a similar statement earlier, so Oliver is a knave.

    Aurora said: ""Alexander is not a knave"".
    Since Aurora told the truth (because she is a knight), Alexander must be a knight.

    Riley told you that If Aurora is a knave then Oliver is a knight.
    Since Aurora is a knight as we concluded above, Riley's statement is the same as ""If Aurora is a knave, then Oliver is a knight."" But Aurora is a knight, so this statement is essentially ""Oliver is a knight"", and since Oliver is a knave, this statement is true, as Riley claimed.

    Ethan asserted: ""Sebastian is a knave"".
    Sebastian commented, ""If Ethan is a knave then Sebastian is a knight"".
    Since Ethan claimed that Sebastian is a knave, and since Ethan lies (because he is a knave), it must be the case that Sebastian is a knight.

    Sebastian commented, ""If Ethan is a knave then Sebastian is a knight"".
    Since we concluded above that Ethan is a knave, this statement is the same as ""If Ethan is a knave, then Sebastian is a knight"", which is true since we just concluded that Sebastian is a knight.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 6 inhabitants: Avery, Oliver, Amelia, Chloe, Benjamin, and Abigail. Avery commented, ""Abigail is a knave"". As Oliver put it, ""Chloe is a knight or Amelia is a knave"". Amelia stated, ""Chloe is a knight"". ""Amelia is a knight if and only if Abigail is a knight,"" Chloe declared. In Benjamin's words: ""Amelia is a knight or Avery is a knave"". In Abigail's words: ""Chloe is a knave if and only if Benjamin is a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Avery commented, ""Abigail is a knave"".
    This statement is a lie since Abigail would not be a knave if Avery was telling the truth. So, Abigail must be a knight.
    
    Amelia stated, ""Chloe is a knight"".
    Since Amelia is a knight, Chloe must be a knight.
    
    Chloe declared: ""Amelia is a knight if and only if Abigail is a knight"".
    Since Amelia and Abigail are both knights, this statement is true.
    
    Benjamin's statement was: ""Amelia is a knight or Avery is a knave"".
    Since Amelia is a knight, this statement is true.
    
    Abigail said: ""Chloe is a knave if and only if Benjamin is a knave"".
    Since Chloe is a knight and Benjamin is a knight, this statement is false, so Abigail must be a knave.

        This must be false, since Evelyn is a knight who made the statement.

        Sebastian expressed that Evelyn is not a knight.

        James stated, ""Sophia is a knave if and only if Sophia is a knight"".
        This must be false, since Sophia is a knave and she does not meet the condition.
        Oliver stated, ""James is a knave or Sebastian is a knave"".

    Charlotte remarked, ""Avery is a knight if and only if Scarlett is a knight.""
    Since Avery is a knight (line 1) and Scarlett is a knight (line 4), it must be that Charlotte is a knight (line 6).

    Riley: Olivia is a knave.
    Since Riley agrees with Owen, we know from Olivia's statement that Emma is a knave.
    Olivia: If Emma is a knave then Matthew is a knave.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 6 inhabitants: James, Isabella, Aiden, Sofia, Matthew, and Aurora. James was heard saying, ""Aiden is a knave if and only if Matthew is a knight"". Isabella remarked, ""Aurora is a knave and James is a knave"". As Aiden put it, ""Aurora is a knight or Aiden is a knight"". Sofia said, ""Matthew is a knave or James is a knave."" Matthew stated, ""James is a knave and Sofia is a knave"". ""Aurora is a knight if and only if James is a knave"" - Aurora. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," James: ""Aiden is a knave if and only if Matthew is a knight.""
     This statement means that Aiden is a knave whenever Matthew is a knight, and Aiden is a knight whenever Matthew is a knave.
     Isabella: ""Aurora is a knave and James is a knave.""
     This statement is a conjunction of ""Aurora is a knave"" and ""James is a knave"". Isabella made a lie, so Aurora must be a knight and James must be a knight.
     Aiden: ""Aurora is a knight or Aiden is a knight.""
     This statement is true since Aurora is a knight, so Aiden is a knight.
     Sofia: ""Matthew is a knave or James is a knave.""
     This statement is true since James is a knight, so Sofia is a knight.
     Aurora: ""Aurora is a knight if and only if James is a knave.""
     Since Aurora is the one who made this statement, Aurora must be a knave, because James is a knight.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 6 inhabitants: Ella, Avery, Samuel, Emily, Aria, and Owen. As Ella put it, ""Samuel is a knight if and only if Ella is a knight"". Avery stated, ""Samuel is a knave if and only if Emily is a knave"". Samuel stated, ""Avery is a knave or Ella is a knight"". Emily expressed that Ella is a knave or Owen is a knave. As Aria put it, ""Samuel is a knave if and only if Emily is a knight"". Owen stated, ""Owen is a knight or Samuel is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Ella put it, ""Samuel is a knight if and only if Ella is a knight"".
    This statement is always true since it's saying the same thing twice, so we don't learn anything new here.

    Avery stated, ""Samuel is a knave if and only if Emily is a knave"".
    Since Emily later states that Ella is a knave or Owen is a knave, we know for sure that Emily is a knave (since Owen can't be a knave, since that would make Owen's statement false). This means Avery's statement, which now reads ""Samuel is a knave if and only if Emily is a knave"", is true, so Samuel is a knight.

    Samuel stated, ""Avery is a knave or Ella is a knight"".
    Since we determined Avery to be a knight and Ella to be a knight, this statement is true, as it must.
    Emily expressed that Ella is a knave or Owen is a knave.
    We determined Ella to be a knight and Samuel's statement to be true, which means Avery is a knight. This means Emily's statement must be false, which only happens when Ella is a knight and Owen is a knight, as that is the only way for Emily to be lying.
    Aria put it, ""Samuel is a knave if and only if Emily is a knight"".
    We determined Samuel to be a knight and Emily to be a knight, so this statement is false, as it must. Therefore, Aria is a knave.
    Owen stated, ""Owen is a knight or Samuel is a knight"".
    Since we determined Owen must be a knight (as he made a true statement), this statement is true, as it must.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 6 inhabitants: Abigail, William, Noah, Grace, Jacob, and Liam.

    If Noah was a knight, Abigail would be lying, which is not possible since Abigail is a knight.

    This statement is a contradiction since Liam cannot be both a knight and a knave. Therefore, William is a knave.

    Noah told you that If William is a knight then Abigail is a knave.
    Since we determined that William is a knave, Noah's statement is true, and so is Noah's truth. Therefore, Noah is a knight.

    Grace was heard saying, ""Noah is a knight if and only if Abigail is a knight"".

    Mia notes, ""If Ava is a knight then Alexander is a knave."" Since Ava is a knight, this would imply that Alexander is a knave, but we already determined that Alexander is a knight, so Ava must be a knave.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 6 inhabitants: Matthew, Benjamin, Amelia, Logan, Alexander, and Sophia. Matthew commented, ""If Alexander is a knight then Logan is a knave"". Benjamin noted, ""If Matthew is a knave then Logan is a knight"". In Amelia's words: ""Amelia is a knight or Benjamin is a knight"". Logan was heard saying, ""Benjamin is not a knave"". Alexander was heard saying, ""Alexander is a knight or Benjamin is a knight"". Sophia commented, ""Amelia is not a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?

    If Matthew is telling the truth, then Alexander must be a knight and Logan a knave.

    This sentence is true, since Chloe claimed that Emily is a knight.

    Since Emily claimed that Grace is a knight, and Chloe's sentence is true, Grace must be a knight.
    Olivia told you that If Chloe is a knave then Emily is a knight.
    Since Chloe is a knight, it doesn't matter whether she is a knave, so this sentence is true.
    Isabella asserted: ""Grace is not a knight"".
    But Grace is a knight, so Isabella lied, and she must be a knave.

Amelia stated, ""Riley is a knave and Scarlett is a knight"". Scarlett asserted: ""Amelia is a knight or Owen is a knave"".

    Assistant: <think>
    "," Riley asserted: ""Scarlett is a knave and Matthew is a knave"".
    This is a contradiction because Riley claimed two different things about Scarlett and Matthew, and they can't both be knaves since knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie.
    Therefore, Riley is a knave.
    Owen commented, ""Scarlett is a knight"".
    Since Riley claimed that Scarlett is a knave, but Owen claims that Scarlett is a knight, Owen must be a knave.
    Matthew remarked, ""Owen is not a knight"".
    Since we determined that Owen is a knave, Matthew is telling the truth, so he must be a knight.
    Amelia stated, ""Riley is a knave and Scarlett is a knight"".
    Since we determined that Riley is a knave, Amelia's first part is true.
    Scarlett asserted: ""Amelia is a knight or Owen is a knave"".
    We determined that Amelia is a knave and Owen is a knave, so one part of Amelia's claim is false and the other is true, which means Scarlett is telling the truth, so Scarlett must be a knight.
    Olivia was heard saying, ""Amelia is a knave if and only if Riley is a knight"".

    "," Ava: ""Emily is a knave if and only if Michael is a knave.""
     This sentence is of the form P if and only if Q, which is equivalent to P implies Q and Q implies P. So we have two implications: Emily is a knave implies Michael is a knave, and Michael is a knave implies Emily is a knave. Since Emily is a knave or Michael is a knave (Emily's statement), the first implication is true. And since Emily is a knave, the first part of the ""if and only if"" must be true, so Michael is a knave.
    Emily: ""Aria is a knight or Michael is a knave.""
    We know Michael is a knave, so this is equivalent to ""Aria is a knight or something is a knave"", which is always true. So Emily is a knight.
    Michael: ""Lily is a knave or Emily is a knave.""

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 6 inhabitants: Sebastian, Liam, Grace, Daniel, Victoria, and Henry. Sebastian commented, ""Henry is a knave and Victoria is a knight"". In Liam's words: ""Victoria is not a knight"". Grace asserted: ""Liam is a knave or Henry is a knight"". Daniel expressed that Daniel is a knight or Liam is a knight. Victoria was heard saying, ""Sebastian is a knave"". ""Grace is a knave or Daniel is a knight,"" Henry mentioned. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Sebastian: ""Henry is a knave and Victoria is a knight"".
    This is a contradiction since Sebastian claimed both Henry and Victoria have different natures from knave and knight. So, Sebastian is a knave.
    Liam's statement: ""Victoria is not a knight"".
    Since Sebastian is a knave, Victoria must be a knave as well, thus the statement of Liam is correct, and Liam is a knight.
    Grace: ""Liam is a knave or Henry is a knight"".
    Since Liam is a knight, Henry must be a knight as well, thus the statement of Grace is correct, and Grace is a knight.
    Victoria said: ""Sebastian is a knave"".
    It is correct, since Sebastian is a knave as we already established. So, Victoria is a knight.
    Henry: ""Grace is a knave or Daniel is a knight"".
    Since Grace is a knight, the statement of Henry is correct, and Daniel must be a knight as well. So, Henry is a knight.

In a statement by Emma: ""Daniel is a knave and Jackson is a knave"". According to Aurora, ""Daniel is a knave if and only if Jackson is a knave"". Jackson noted, ""Oliver is not a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Daniel: ""If Owen is a knave then Jackson is a knight.""
    This statement is true since Owen is a knave as stated by Owen, so Jackson must be a knight.

    Oliver: ""Jackson is a knight if and only if Aurora is a knight.""
    This statement must be true, since Aurora is a knave as stated by Owen, Jackson cannot be a knight, so the ""if"" part of the ""if and only if"" is satisfied.

    Owen: ""Emma is a knave.""
    This statement must be true since Emma claims that Daniel is a knave, but Daniel is telling the truth as his statement was true, so Daniel must be a knight, and therefore Emma must be a knave.

    Emma: ""Daniel is a knave and Jackson is a knave.""
    This statement must be false, since we have determined Daniel to be a knight. Therefore, Emma is a knave.

    Aurora: ""Daniel is a knave if and only if Jackson is a knave.""
    This statement must be true since Daniel is a knight as determined above, so Jackson must be a knight.

    Oliver said that Lily is a knight and William is a knight.
    This is true since both Lily and William are knight.

    Lily is a knave since she claims that Luke is a knight whenever William is a knight.

        This must be true because Liam declared Emily is a knight and Owen declared Liam is a knave, which is a contradiction since knights never lie.

        This statement must be false since we determined earlier that Owen is a knave.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 5 inhabitants: Samuel, Mason, Grace, David, and Zoey. Samuel asserted: ""Zoey is not a knight"". In a statement by Mason: ""Zoey is a knave if and only if David is a knight"". Grace expressed that Samuel is a knight. ""Samuel is not a knave"" - David. Zoey said that If David is a knight then Samuel is a knight. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Samuel asserted: ""Zoey is not a knight"".
    If Samuel is telling the truth, then Zoey must be a knave.
    But if Samuel is a knave, then the statement Zoey is not a knight must be a lie, which means Zoey is a knight.
    These two results cannot be true simultaneously, so Samuel must be a knave.
    Mason: ""Zoey is a knave if and only if David is a knight"".
    If David is a knight, then Samuel asserted that Zoey is a knave, so Zoey must be a knave.
    If David is a knave, then Samuel asserted that Zoey is a knight, so Zoey must be a knight.
    Since both results are possible, we cannot determine from Mason's statement whether David is a knight or a knave.
    Grace expressed that Samuel is a knight, but we determined that Samuel is a knave.
    Therefore, Grace is a knave.
    David said: ""Samuel is not a knave"".
    Since we concluded that Samuel is a knave, David must be a knight.
    Zoey said: ""If David is a knight then Samuel is a knight"".
    Since David is a knight and Samuel is a knave, this statement is false, but Zoey lied to us, so Zoey must be a knight.

Joseph stated, ""If Benjamin is a knave then Ella is a knave"". ""Sebastian is a knight if and only if Benjamin is a knave"" - Ella. Benjamin asserted: ""If Benjamin is a knight then Ella is a knave"". Sebastian noted, ""Riley is not a knight"". Riley stated, ""Benjamin is a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Joseph stated, ""If Benjamin is a knave then Ella is a knave"".
    This statement is always true since it is multiplying a knave by a knave, so Joseph is a knight.
    Ella said: ""Sebastian is a knight if and only if Benjamin is a knave"".
    We know from Benjamin's statement that Benjamin is a knave, so Ella's claim is true, which means Sebastian is a knave.
    Benjamin asserted: ""If Benjamin is a knight then Ella is a knave"".
    Since Benjamin claimed that Ella is a knave, and we know Ella is a knave (since Ella lied when claiming Sebastian is a knight), this statement is true, and so Benjamin is a knight.
    Sebastian noted: ""Riley is not a knight"".
    We know Benjamin is a knight, and Benjamin claimed Ella is a knave, so Ella is a knave. We also know Joseph is a knight, and Joseph's statement is true because Benjamin (a knight) claims Ella (a knave) is a knave, so Joseph's statement is true, and therefore, as Joseph is a knight, his statement is true. Since Joseph's statement is true, it must be the case that Riley is a knave, as Sebastian claimed. So Sebastian is a knight.
    Riley stated: ""Benjamin is a knave"".

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 5 inhabitants: Penelope, Elizabeth, Mia, Emily, and Ava. Penelope remarked, ""Mia is a knave if and only if Emily is a knight"". Elizabeth expressed that If Emily is a knight then Elizabeth is a knight. Mia stated, ""Mia is a knight if and only if Ava is a knight"". Emily stated, ""Mia is a knave and Ava is a knave"". Ava noted, ""Mia is not a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?

    This is equivalent to saying ""If Emily is a knight, then Mia is a knave, and if Emily is a knave, then Mia is a knight"".
    Since Emily stated that Mia is a knave and Ava is a knave, Emily is a knight (since Ava is not a knave as Mia stated).
    Since Emily is a knight, Mia is a knave.
    Elizabeth expressed that If Emily is a knight then Elizabeth is a knight.
    Since Emily is a knight, Elizabeth is a knight.
    Mia stated, ""Mia is a knight if and only if Ava is a knight"".

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 5 inhabitants: Amelia, Avery, Owen, Henry, and Aurora.

    Assistant: <think>
    "," Amelia says that Aurora is a knave. But if that were true, Avery's statement would be true, but Amelias statement would be false, which is a contradiction. Thus, Amelia's statement must be false, which means that Aurora is a knight.
    Avery claims that Avery is a knave and Aurora is a knight. But if Aurora were a knight, Avery's part would be true, but Amelia's part would be false, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Avery is a knave.
    Owen claims that Avery is a knave and Aurora is a knight. Aurora claims that Avery is not a knight, but we determined that Aurora is a knight, so Avery must be a knave. Therefore, Owen is a knave.
    Henry claims that if Owen is a knight, then Avery is a knave. But since Owen is a knave, this statement is not affected. We already determined that Avery is a knave, so Henry is a knight.

    This is always true since nothing can be both a knave and not a knight. So we learn nothing from this statement.
    
    Mason said, ""Elizabeth is a knave if and only if Charlotte is a knave.""
    Since Elizabeth did not claim to be a knave, this means that Charlotte must be a knight since Mason claimed Elizabeth would be a knave if Charlotte were a knave. So Mason is telling the truth.

    Since Mason said Charlotte is a knight, this is true, so Samuel is telling the truth and must be a knight.

According to Sophia, ""If Sophia is a knight then Benjamin is a knave"". In Michael's words: ""If Benjamin is a knight then Ava is a knave"".

    Assistant: <think>
    "," Benjamin remarked: ""Ella is a knave if and only if Ava is a knight"".
    This is a biconditional statement, so both parts must be true or false at the same time.
    If Ava is a knight, then Ella is a knave.
    If Ava is a knave, then Ella is a knight.
    Ava was heard saying: ""Ava is a knight or Michael is a knave"".
    This is a disjunction, so the parts must differ in truth value.
    If Ava is a knight, then Michael is a knave.
    If Ava is a knave, then Michael is a knight.
    Sophia claimed: ""If Sophia is a knight then Benjamin is a knave"".
    Since Sophia made a true statement (if the antecedent is true), then the consequent must be true as well.
    Therefore, Benjamin is a knave.
    Michael's statement was: ""If Benjamin is a knight then Ava is a knave"".
    Since Benjamin is a knave, a false antecedent implies anything can happen regarding Ava.

     This statement is true because it doesn't matter if Daniel is a knave, but in either case Lily is a knight as asserted.
     Zoey: ""Avery is a knave and Avery is a knight.""
     This is a contradiction, so Zoey is a knave.
     Avery: ""Lily is not a knight.""
     Since Lily made a claim, Lily must be a knight or a knave. If Lily were a knave, Avery's statement would be true, but we know Lily is a knight, so Lily must be a knave.
     Lily: ""Daniel is a knight or Avery is a knight,""
     Since Avery is a knave, the only possibility is that Daniel is a knight, so Lily's statement is true and Lily is a knight.

    This statement is contradicted by Michael's comment, so Ava must be a knave.

    Michael's statement was ""If Luke is a knave then Ava is a knight"".
    Since Ava is a knave, Michael's condition Luke is a knave is falsified, but the result that Ava is a knight follows anyway, so Michael must be a knight.

    This is true since Logan is a knight, so Elizabeth must be a knight.

In Lily's words: ""If Mason is a knave then Penelope is a knight"". Penelope commented, ""Benjamin is a knight or Mason is a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Benjamin says: ""If Penelope is a knight then Penelope is a knave"".
    This statement is implicitly asking: ""Is Penelope a knave?""
    Since Benjamin claims that Penelope is a knave, and she either is or isn't, this is a true statement, so Penelope must be a knave.

    Mason says: ""Jacob is a knight if and only if Lily is a knight"".
    We can rephrase this as: ""If Jacob is a knight, then Lily is a knight.""
    We are told that Jacob is a knave, so this statement is true since both parts are backwards conditional statements with a true major premise and a true conclusion.

    Jacob says: ""Lily is a knave"".
    This is contradicted by Mason's statement that Lily is a knight, so Jacob is a knave.
    Since Jacob is a knave, his negation of Lily's statement must be true, so Lily is a knight.

    Lily says: ""If Mason is a knave then Penelope is a knight"".
    Since Mason is a knave, the condition of the implication is true, and so the whole implication is true regardless of the truth value of Penelope, so Penelope is either a knight or a knave.
    We know Penelope made a true statement, so Penelope is a knight.

""If Liam is a knight then Victoria is a knight"" - Liam. Joseph was heard saying, ""Liam is a knave or Victoria is a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?

    "," Victoria said: ""Owen is a knave.""
    This statement must be false since Victoria claimed Owen is a knave, but Victoria said it, a knave wouldn't say such a thing.
    Therefore, Victoria is a knave.
    
    Owen stated: ""Liam is a knave and Joseph is a knave"".

    Since Liam is a knight, Joseph must be a knave.

    Assistant: <think>
    "," Aria: ""Sofia is a knave or Michael is a knave"".
     If Sofia is a Knave, then the statement is true, since Michael would have to be a Knave.

     Therefore, the statement is true.
    Jacob: ""Victoria is a knight and Michael is a knave"".

     Since Aria is telling the truth (as per our previous conclusion), then Michael has to be a Knave.
    Michael: ""Victoria is a knave and Michael is a knight"".
     Since Victoria is a Knave, the first part of the statement is true. However, since Michael is a Knave, the second part is false. This is a contradiction. Therefore, Michael is a Knave.

""If Matthew is a knave then Amelia is a knave,"" Olivia declared. ""If Lily is a knight then Matthew is a knight"" - Amelia. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Olivia noted, ""If Matthew is a knave then Amelia is a knave."" But Matthew told us that ""Mia is a knight if and only if Lily is a knave."" So Olivia must be a knight, since Matthew told a lie (Mia cannot be a knight).
    Mia noted, ""Olivia is a knave and Lily is a knave."" But Olivia is a knight, so Mia must be wrong about Olivia. Therefore, Mia is a knave.
    Matthew said, ""Mia is a knight if and only if Lily is a knave."" But we know Mia is a knave, so this must be a lie, and therefore Matthew is a knave.
    Lily put it, ""Olivia is a knave or Matthew is a knight."" But Matthew is a knave, so Olivia must be a knight, and Lily is telling the truth.

     This directly contradicts what Samuel said since Penelope is a knave but Matthew claims that Penelope is a knight. So Owen must be a knave.
     Matthew: ""If Samuel is a knight then Penelope is a knave.""

    So Victoria must be a knave.
    Therefore, Logan claims that Aiden is a knave if and only if Victoria is a knight, but Victoria is a knave, so Logan is telling the truth and must be a knight.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 4 inhabitants: Grace, Jackson, Sofia, and Jacob.

Bobby buys two packets of candy. He eats two candies every day from Monday through Friday and takes one each during the remaining days of the week. If it takes him 3 such weeks to finish the 2 packets, how many candies are in a packet?
Let's think: He eats 2 * 5 = 10 candies a week from Monday through Friday. He eats 1 * 2 = 2 candies a week on Saturday and Sunday. He eats 10 + 2 = 12 candies a week. He eats 12 * 3 = 36 candies in 3 weeks. There are 2 candies in a packet so there must be 36 / 2 = 18 candies in each packet.. The answer is: 18.

A group of 300 athletes spent Saturday night at Ultimate Fitness Camp. The next morning, for 4 hours straight, they left the camp at a rate of 28 athletes per hour.

What is the difference in the total number of athletes in the camp over the two nights?
Let's think: The camp lost 28 athletes per hour for 4 hours, a total of 28 * 4 = 112 athletes. The camp gained 15 athletes per hour for 7 hours, a total of 15 * 7 = 105 athletes.

The camp lost 28 athletes per hour for 4 hours, a total of 28 * 4 = 112 athletes. The camp gained 15 athletes per hour for 7 hours, a total of 15 * 7 = 105 athletes. The net change in the number of athletes in the camp over the two nights is 105 - 112 = -7 athletes. The difference in the total number of athletes in the camp over the two nights is 300 - 293 = 7 athletes.. The answer is: 7.","(1) Samuel is a knight

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 4 inhabitants: Samuel, Amelia, Aiden, and Zoey. Samuel said, ""If Amelia is a knight then Amelia is a knave."" Amelia said, ""If Aiden is a knight then Zoey is a knight."" ""Amelia is a knave and Samuel is a knight,"" Aiden declared. Zoey was heard saying, ""Samuel is a knight or Amelia is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Samuel said, ""If Amelia is a knight then Amelia is a knave.""
    This statement is a contradiction because knights always tell the truth. So, Samuel must be a knave.
    Amelia said, ""If Aiden is a knight then Zoey is a knight.""
    We know Samuel is a knave, so the premise of Amelia's statement is false (Aiden is a knight, but Zoey is not). Amelia can't be a knave because that would make her statement true, so Amelia must be a knight.
    Aiden declared, ""Amelia is a knave and Samuel is a knight.""
    We know Amelia is a knight and Samuel is a knave, so Aiden's statement is false. Aiden must be a knave.
    Zoey was heard saying, ""Samuel is a knight or Amelia is a knight.""
    Since Amelia is a knight, Zoey's statement is true and she must be a knight.
    }
    answer:
    (1) Samuel is a knave
(2) Amelia is a knight
(3) Aiden is a knave
(4) Zoey is a knight
Answer: Knight

Question: Alex, Brad, and Chris are logicians. Alex says: At least one of us is a knave. Brad says: Alex is a knave. Chris says: I am not a knave. What are they?
Options:
(A) Alex is a knight, Brad is a knight, Chris is a knave
(B) Alex is a knight, Brad is a knave, Chris is a knight
(C) Alex is a knave, Brad is a knave, Chris is a knight
(D) Alex is a knight, Brad is a knave, Chris is a knave
(E) Alex is a knave, Brad is a knave, Chris is a knight
Answer: (B) Alex is a knight, Brad is a knave, Chris is a knight
Explanation: If Alex is a knave, then the statement ""At least one of us is a knave"" would be false, which is a contradiction. So, Alex must be a knight.
If Brad is a knight, then his statement ""Alex is a knave"" would be true, which is a contradiction. So, Brad must be a knave.
Since Alex is a knight and Brad is a knave, the statement ""I am not a knave"" must be true, so Chris must be a knight.

Question: Amy, Andy and Beth are three sisters. One day, they placed some dimes on a table, in three consecutive places, so that the total number of dimes could be divided by 3. Then, Amy picked up some dimes from place 1 and put them on place 2, so that the number of dimes on place 1 was divided by 3. After that, Andy picked up some dimes from place 2 and put them on place 3, so that the number of dimes on place 2 was divided by 3. Finally, Beth picked up some dimes from place 3 and put them on place 1, so that the number of dimes on place 3 was divided by 3.

What can you say about the total number of dimes?
Options:
(A) It is odd.
(B) It is divisible by 3.
(C) It is divisible by 9.
(D) It is divisible by 11.
(E) It is divisible by 12.
Answer: (B) It is divisible by 3.
Explanation: Let's assume the total number of dimes is x. After Amy, the number of dimes on place 1 is x - a, and on place 2 is a. After Andy, the number of dimes on place 2 is a - b, and on place 3 is b. After Beth, the number of dimes on place 3 is b + c, and on place 1 is c. So, x - a + a - b + b + c = x + c is divisible by 3. Therefore, the total number of dimes is divisible by 3.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 4 inhabitants: Lily, Liam, Samuel, and Jackson. According to Lily, ""Lily is a knight if and only if Samuel is a knave"". In Liam's words: ""Samuel is a knave"". Samuel said that Lily is a knave.

    Assistant: <think>
    "," According to Lily, ""Lily is a knight if and only if Samuel is a knave"".
    This statement is a contradiction since Lily can not be both a knight and a knave. So Lily must be a knave.
    Liam claims that ""Samuel is a knave"".
    Since Lily claimed that Samuel is a knave if and only if Lily is a knight, and since Lily is a knave, it must be true that Samuel is a knave.
    Samuel claims that Lily is a knave.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 4 inhabitants: Olivia, Sofia, James, and Benjamin. Olivia told you that Sofia is a knight. In Sofia's words: ""Olivia is a knave and Sofia is a knight"". As James put it, ""Benjamin is not a knight"". Benjamin said that Olivia is not a knight. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>

    Sofia said: ""Olivia is a knave and Sofia is a knight"".

    James said: ""Benjamin is not a knight"".
    Since Sofia is a knave, what Sofia said (that Olivia is a knave) is false, so Olivia is a knight.

    Assistant: <think>
    "," Samuel asserted: ""Liam is a knave and Lily is a knave"".
    This is a contradiction because Samuel cannot both say that Liam is a knave and that Lily is a knave since you can't be a knave and a knight at the same time. Therefore, Samuel is a knave.
    Victoria said, ""Lily is a knight and Liam is a knight"".
    Since Samuel is a knave, Liam cannot be a knight. Therefore, Victoria must be a knave.
    Liam mentioned, ""If Liam is a knight then Samuel is a knave.""
    Since we determined that Samuel is a knave, Liam must be a knight.

    This means that Penelope is saying that Sofia is a knight because Penelope's statement is true.

    This is true since we determined that Penelope is a knight, and Sofia stated that Penelope is a knight.
    Samuel asserted: ""Penelope is a knave and Penelope is a knight.""

    Zoey claims that Elizabeth is a knight if and only if Emma is a knight.
    Sebastian claims that Zoey is a knave or Zoey is a knight, which is a tautology and therefore true.
    If Emma is a knave, then Emma's claim must be false, so Zoey cannot be a knight, which is a contradiction.

    This is a contradiction, since Emma would not claim that Avery is a knave if Lucas were a knave (in that case, Emma would be telling the truth, not lying, by claiming Avery is a knave). So Avery must be a knave.
    Aiden said: ""Lucas is not a knight"".
    Since Avery is a knave, Avery did not claim that Lucas is a knight. So Aiden must be telling the truth: Lucas must be a knave.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 4 inhabitants: Jacob, Zoey, Henry, and David. Jacob remarked, ""Henry is a knave and David is a knave"". In Zoey's words: ""If Jacob is a knight then Zoey is a knight"". Henry commented, ""If David is a knave then Jacob is a knight"". David said that David is a knight. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Jacob said that Henry is a knave and David is a knave.
    According to Zoey, if Jacob is a knight (which he isn't), then Zoey is a knight. Since the premise is false, Zoey's statement is true, so Zoey is a knight.
    Henry commented, ""If David is a knave then Jacob is a knight"". But David said that David is a knight, so David is not a knave. This means that Henry's statement was ""If David is a knave then Jacob is a knight"", or, equivalently, ""Jacob is a knight"". So Henry is a knight.
    Jacob said that Henry is a knave and David is a knave. But we already know that Henry is a knight, so Jacob lied, and he must be a knave.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 3 inhabitants: Amelia, Penelope, and Evelyn. Amelia said that Evelyn is not a knight. Penelope was heard saying, ""Penelope is a knight or Evelyn is a knave"". Evelyn was heard saying, ""Penelope is a knight if and only if Penelope is a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Amelia said that Evelyn is not a knight.
    This is impossible, since Amelia claims that Evelyn is a knave, but Amelia would be a knight in that case, since knaves lie. So Amelia is a knave.

    Since Amelia is a knave, Penelope is a knight, since both parts of the disjunction are true. So Penelope is a knight.

    This statement is of the form ""If P then Q"", where P is ""Liam is a knave"" and Q is ""Liam is a knight"".

    A statement of the form ""R or Q"" is always true, no matter what R and Q are, because ""or"" stands for ""true or false"". So Samuel's statement is always true, and we can confirm that Samuel is a knight since that makes his statement true.

    This statement is of the form ""If P then Q"", where P is ""Liam is a knave"" and Q is ""Samuel is a knave"".

    We already know from above that Samuel is a knight, so we can simplify this statement to ""Liam is not a knight or Samuel is a knave"".
    Since we know Samuel is a knight, it must be the case that Liam is a knave, since that makes the whole or-condition true.

    Alexander's statement: ""Michael is a knight if and only if Michael is a knave.""
    If Alexander is a knight, his statement would be true, so Michael would be a knave, but we already said Avery is telling the truth, so Avery would say that Alexander is a knight, which is a contradiction. So Alexander must be a knave.

    Scarlett remarked: ""Lily is not a knave"".
    Since Lily is a knight (as all knights tell the truth), this statement is true, and Scarlett, by saying it, must be a knight.
    Aria remarked: ""Scarlett is a knight and Aria is a knight"".
