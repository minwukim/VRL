    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Harper, Benjamin, Olivia, Daniel, Henry, Jackson, and Sebastian. According to Harper, ""Sebastian is a knave if and only if Henry is a knight"". Benjamin asserted: ""Henry is a knight if and only if Olivia is a knight"". Olivia commented, ""Benjamin is a knave and Daniel is a knave"". Daniel stated, ""Jackson is a knave"". Henry told you that Olivia is not a knight. Jackson said that Harper is a knight and Benjamin is a knight. Sebastian told you that Daniel is a knight and Jackson is a knight. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Harper said that if Sebastian is a knave then Henry is a knave, and the opposite is true as well. This means Harper and Sebastian have opposite identities. Benjamin said that if Henry is a knight then Olivia is a knight, so they have the same identity. Olivia said that Benjamin is a knave and Daniel is a knave, but we know Benjamin is a knight, so Olivia is a knave and Daniel is a knight. Jackson said that Harper is a knight and Benjamin is a knight, but we know Benjamin is a knave, so Jackson is a knave. This means Harper is a knight. Since Harper is a knight, Sebastian is a knave. Henry said Olivia is not a knight, so Henry is a knave. Jackson is a knave, so his statement about Sebastian is false, meaning Sebastian is a knight. Finally, since Sebastian is a knight, Daniel is a knight. </think>

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Michael, Joseph, Jackson, Aurora, Sebastian, Jacob, and Zoey. According to Michael, ""If Aurora is a knight then Jackson is a knight"". As Joseph put it, ""Sebastian is a knight if and only if Sebastian is a knave"". ""Michael is a knave if and only if Jacob is a knave"" - Jackson. Aurora was heard saying, ""Michael is a knight"". Sebastian said, ""Zoey is a knight and Joseph is a knight."" ""Joseph is a knight if and only if Sebastian is a knight,"" Jacob declared. ""If Sebastian is a knave then Aurora is a knave,"" Zoey declared. So who is a knight and who is a knave?

    "," Michael said that if Aurora is a knight, then Jackson is a knight. Since Michael is a knight, Aurora must be a knight, making Jackson a knight as well.
     Joseph claimed that Sebastian is a knight if and only if Sebastian is a knave, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Joseph is a knave.
     Jackson stated that if Jacob is a knave, then Jacob is a knight, making Jacob a knave.
     Aurora said that Michael is a knight, which is true, so Aurora is a knight.
     Sebastian said that Zoey is a knight and Joseph is a knight, which is true, so Zoey is a knight and Joseph is a knight.
     Jacob asserted that if Sebastian is a knave, then Aurora is a knave, which is false since Sebastian is a knight and Aurora is a knight.
     Zoey is a knight, so her statement that Joseph is a knight if and only if Sebastian is a knight is true, confirming that Joseph is a knight and Sebastian is a knight.

    Assistant: <think>
    "," Olivia said that if Henry is a knave then Lily is a knight. Since Olivia is a knave, the statement must be false, which means Henry must be a knight and Lily a knight.
     Since Lily is a knight, she said that if Lily is a knight then Chloe is a knight, so Chloe is a knight.
     Ava said that Olivia is a knave, which is true, so Ava is a knight.
     Since Chloe is a knight, the statement he made, Ava is a knave or Henry is a knight, must be true, so Henry is a knight.
     Lily is a knight, so her statement that if Lily is a knight then Chloe is a knight is true.
     Grace said that Olivia is a knave and Chloe is a knave, but we determined that Chloe is a knight, so Grace is a knave.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Alexander, Luke, Henry, Chloe, Daniel, Riley, and Mia. ""Mia is a knave and Mia is a knight,"" Alexander mentioned. Luke said that Chloe is a knave if and only if Riley is a knave. In a statement by Henry: ""If Chloe is a knight then Mia is a knight"". Chloe stated, ""Riley is a knight and Henry is a knight"". Daniel said that If Luke is a knave then Daniel is a knight. Riley expressed that Mia is not a knave. Mia noted, ""Alexander is a knave or Alexander is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Alexander said that Mia is both a knave and a knight, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Alexander is a knave.
     Luke stated that Chloe is a knave if and only if Riley is a knave. Since Alexander is a knave, his statement is true, which means Chloe and Riley have different identities.
     Henry said that if Chloe is a knight then Mia is a knight. Since Alexander is a knave, Henry's statement is true, making Chloe a knight and Mia a knight.
     Chloe said that Riley is a knight and Daniel is a knight. Since Chloe is a knight, both Riley and Daniel are knights.
     Daniel said that if Luke is a knave then Daniel is a knight. Since Luke is a knight, this statement is true, and Daniel is a knight.

    "," Ethan said that if Jacob is a knave then Amelia is a knight. We'll start from this statement. If Ethan is a knight, then his statement is true, which means that if Jacob is a knave (a liar), then Amelia must be a knight (truth-teller). So, Amelia is a knight.
     Amelia declared that Charlotte is a knight, so we confirm that Charlotte is a knight.
     Noah said that Jack is a knight and Amelia is a knight, so Jack must also be a knight.
     Daniel said that Amelia is a knave if and only if Ethan is a knave, but we know Amelia is a knight, so Ethan must be a knight.
     Charlotte said that Ethan is a knave or Jacob is a knight, but we know Ethan is a knight, so Jacob must be a knight.
     Jacob said that Daniel is a knight or Charlotte is a knave, and we've determined both are knights, so his statement is true.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 7 inhabitants: Charlotte, Daniel, Aiden, Emily, Jack, Olivia, and Isabella. Charlotte told you that Daniel is a knight and Emily is a knight. Daniel asserted: ""Olivia is a knight or Olivia is a knave"". Aiden asserted: ""Isabella is a knight if and only if Charlotte is a knave"". ""Olivia is a knight,"" Emily declared. Jack asserted: ""If Daniel is a knight then Emily is a knave"". Olivia said that Jack is a knave and Aiden is a knave. According to Isabella, ""Aiden is not a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Daniel said that Olivia is a knight or Olivia is a knave, which is true because it's a tautology. Emily said that Olivia is a knight, so Olivia is a knight.

Since Daniel is a knight, his assertion that Olivia is a knight is true, so Olivia is a knight as confirmed. Because Charlotte is a knight, Aiden's statement that Isabella is a knight if and only if Charlotte is a knave is a lie, so Aiden is a knave. Because Aiden is a knave, his part of the statement that Isabella is a knight is a lie, so Isabella is a knave. Finally, since Isabella is a knave, her statement that Aiden is not a knight is true, which is consistent with Aiden being a knave. </think>

     Since James told the truth, he stated that Ethan is a knight or Penelope is a knight. 
     As Elizabeth is a knave, Amelia is a knight, so Amelia told the truth when she said that James is a knight. Therefore, James is a knight.

     Since Ethan is a knight, what he said is true, meaning Ava is a knight.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 6 inhabitants: Sebastian, Owen, Matthew, Ava, Samuel, and Lily.

Daniel said, ""Daniel is a knight if and only if Sophia is a knight."" Chloe noted, ""Sophia is not a knave"". Sebastian was heard saying, ""Sophia is a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Isabella stated that either Sophia is a knave or Daniel is a knight. Since Isabella is a knight, Sophia must be a knight. Joseph's statement says that if Daniel is a knight, then Joseph is a knight. Since Sophia is a knight, Daniel must be a knight. This makes Joseph a knight as well. Sebastian claimed that Sophia is a knight, but he is a knave, so Sophia must be a knave, which contradicts our previous conclusion. Therefore, Sebastian must be a knave. Chloe said that Sophia is a knight, but we've determined that Sophia is a knave, so Chloe is a knave. Daniel said that he is a knight if and only if Sophia is a knight, but we know Sophia is a knave, so Daniel must be a knave. Finally, Sebastian said that Sophia is a knave, which is true, so Sebastian is a knave as we determined earlier. </think>

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 6 inhabitants: Ava, Mia, Evelyn, Jack, Logan, and Lily. Ava told you that Jack is a knight if and only if Evelyn is a knave. Mia commented, ""Ava is not a knight"". Evelyn remarked, ""Ava is a knight if and only if Mia is a knave"". Jack stated, ""Mia is a knave and Ava is a knave"". Logan said, ""If Lily is a knight then Evelyn is a knave."" Lily stated, ""Mia is a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Ava said that if and only if Jack is a knight, then Evelyn is a knave. Since Ava would only say such a thing if she were a knight (as knights tell the truth), then Jack must be a knight and Evelyn must be a knave.
     Since Jack is a knight, he said that Mia is a knave and Ava is a knave, but we know Ava is a knight, so Jack must be a knave.
     Since Jack is a knave, his statement that Mia is a knave must be false, which means Mia is a knight.
     Since Mia is a knight, her statement that Ava is not a knight is true, which means Ava is a knight.
     Since Ava is a knight, her statement that Evelyn is a knave is true, which means Evelyn is a knave.
     Since Evelyn is a knave, her statement that Mia is a knave if and only if Ava is a knight must be false, which means Mia is not a knave (she is a knight as we already determined).
     Since Logan said that if Lily is a knight, then Evelyn is a knave, and we know Evelyn is a knave, this statement is true regardless of Lily's type, so Logan is a knight.
     Since Lily said that Mia is a knave, and we know Mia is a knight, this statement is false, which means Lily is a knave.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 6 inhabitants: Luke, Alexander, Liam, Mason, Sophia, and Ava. Luke commented, ""If Ava is a knight then Mason is a knave"". Alexander remarked, ""Ava is a knight if and only if Luke is a knight"". In Liam's words: ""Liam is a knight if and only if Ava is a knave"". Mason stated, ""Ava is not a knave"". Sophia noted, ""If Mason is a knave then Liam is a knave"". According to Ava, ""Sophia is not a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?

     Liam claimed, ""Liam is a knight (L) if and only if Ava is a knave (~A).""
     Mason declared, ""Ava is not a knave (A).""
     Sophia noted, ""If Mason is a knave (~M) then Liam is a knave (~L).""
     Ava stated, ""Sophia is not a knave (S).""
    Since Mason said, ""Ava is not a knave (A),"" Mason is a knight and Ava is a knight.
     Since Mason is a knight, Luke's statement, ""If Ava is a knight (A), then Mason is a knave (~M),"" is a true statement, which means Luke is a knave and his statement is false.
     Since Luke is a knave, his statement, ""If Ava is a knight (A), then Mason is a knave (~M),"" is a false statement, which means at least one of them is telling the truth. Since we already determined that Mason is a knight, Ava must be a knight.
     Since Ava is a knight, Sophia's statement, ""If Mason is a knave (~M) then Liam is a knave (~L),"" is a true statement, which means Liam is a knight.
     Since Ava is a knight, Sophia is a knight, and Sophia stated, ""Sophia is not a knave (S),"" which is a true statement.
     Since Ava is a knight, Alexander's statement, ""Ava is a knight (A) if and only if Luke is a knight (L),"" is a true statement, which means Luke is a knave, and his statement is false. Therefore, Alexander is a knight.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 6 inhabitants: Mia, Owen, Daniel, Henry, Matthew, and Alexander.

In a statement by Matthew: ""If Matthew is a knight then Alexander is a knave"". Alexander stated, ""Owen is a knave or Matthew is a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>

     Since Owen told the truth, Daniel is a knight.

     Henry confirmed that Owen is not a knave, which is consistent with Owen being a knight.
     Since Matthew is a knight, his statement that if he is a knight, then Alexander is a knave, must be true, making Alexander a knave.
     Finally, since Owen is a knight, his statement that Alexander is not a knight is true, which aligns with Alexander being a knave. </think>

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 6 inhabitants: Riley, Amelia, Mia, Ava, Joseph, and Olivia. Riley noted, ""Olivia is a knave if and only if Ava is a knight"". ""Riley is a knave if and only if Mia is a knight,"" Amelia declared. ""If Ava is a knave then Joseph is a knave"" - Mia. Ava said, ""Riley is a knight and Joseph is a knight."" In Joseph's words: ""Mia is a knave or Ava is a knave"". Olivia said that Amelia is a knight and Ava is a knave. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Riley stated that Olivia is a knave if and only if Ava is a knight. Since Riley cannot be a knave (as he always tells the truth), Olivia must be a knave and Ava must be a knight.

     Mia believed that if Ava is a knave then Joseph is a knave. Since Ava is a knight, Joseph must be a knight.
     Ava asserted that Riley is a knight and Joseph is a knight. Since we determined both are knights, her statement is true.
     Joseph interpreted that Mia is a knave or Ava is a knave. Since Mia is a knave, his statement is true.
     Olivia affirmed that Amelia is a knight and Ava is a knave. Since we determined Amelia is a knight and Ava is a knight, her statement is false, meaning Olivia is a knave. </think>

    Ethan claimed that if Chloe is a knight, then Oliver is a knave. Since we've determined that Oliver is a knight, Chloe must be a knight, making Ethan a knight.
    Chloe stated that if Oliver is a knight, then Alexander is a knave. With Oliver being a knight, Alexander must be a knave, making Chloe a knight.
    Alexander believed that if Ethan is a knight, then Aria is a knave. Since we know Ethan is a knight, Aria must be a knave, making Alexander a knave.

    Assistant: <think>

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 5 inhabitants: Luke, Grace, Zoey, Sebastian, and Harper. Luke said, ""Sebastian is a knight if and only if Zoey is a knave."" In Grace's words: ""If Zoey is a knave then Zoey is a knight"". Zoey commented, ""Sebastian is a knight if and only if Zoey is a knight"". Sebastian commented, ""Harper is a knave if and only if Sebastian is a knight"". Harper said that Grace is a knight. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Luke said that if and only if Zoey is a knave, then Sebastian is a knight. Since Luke tells the truth, Sebastian must be a knight if Zoey is a knave.
     Grace said that if Zoey is a knave, then Zoey is a knight. This is a contradiction, so Zoey must be a knight and Grace a knave.
     Zoey said that if Sebastian is a knight, then Sebastian is a knight. Since Zoey is a knight, Sebastian must be a knight.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 5 inhabitants: Aiden, Victoria, Lucas, Benjamin, and Grace. ""Benjamin is a knight if and only if Grace is a knight,"" Aiden declared. Victoria was heard saying, ""Aiden is a knight"". Lucas said that Aiden is not a knight. Benjamin was heard saying, ""Lucas is a knave"". Grace noted, ""Victoria is a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Aiden states that Benjamin is a knight if and only if Grace is a knight. Since Aiden is a knight, both parts of the ""if and only if"" statement must be true. Therefore, Benjamin is a knight, and Grace is a knight.
     Victoria claims that Aiden is a knight, so since Aiden is a knight, Victoria is also a knight.
     Lucas says that Aiden is not a knight, but we've determined Aiden is a knight, so Lucas is a knave.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 5 inhabitants: Luke, Michael, Jackson, Emma, and Zoey.

    Since Charlotte is a knave, her statement that James is a knave is false, so James must be a knight.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 5 inhabitants: Noah, Elizabeth, Logan, Charlotte, and Harper.

""Elizabeth is a knave or Noah is a knight,"" Charlotte claimed. Harper noted, ""Charlotte is a knave and Noah is a knave"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Noah said that Logan is a knave and a knight, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Noah is a knave.
     Logan stated that if Noah is a knight, then he is a knight. Since Noah is a knave, this statement is true, so Logan is a knight.
     Elizabeth said that Logan is a knight or Harper is a knave. Since Logan is a knight, this statement is true, so Elizabeth is a knight.

As Riley put it, ""Lily is a knight or Mason is a knave"". Aria expressed that Lily is a knave if and only if Mason is a knight. ""Lily is a knight or Aria is a knight,"" Lily claimed. Mason noted, ""Lily is a knave or Michael is a knight"". Michael noted, ""Lily is a knave if and only if Lily is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Riley's statement that ""Lily is a knight or Mason is a knave"" could be true if Lily is a knight and Mason is a knight, or if Lily is a knave and Mason is a knave. Aria said that ""Lily is a knave if and only if Mason is a knight,"" so if Lily is a knave, then Mason must be a knight. This means that Lily's statement that ""Lily is a knight or Aria is a knight"" must be false, so Lily must be a knave and Aria must be a knave. This also makes Mason a knight because Lily is a knave. Michael's statement that ""Lily is a knave if and only if Lily is a knight"" is false, so Michael must be a knave. This means that his statement that Lily is a knave is false, so Lily must be a knight, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Riley must be a knave. This makes Mason a knight, Aria a knave, and Michael a knave. Since Riley is a knave, his statement that Lily is a knight or Mason is a knave must be false, so Lily must be a knight and Mason must be a knight. Finally, since Aria is a knave, her statement that Lily is a knave must be false, so Lily must be a knight, which is consistent with our previous findings that Lily is a knight. </think>

As Luke put it, ""Victoria is not a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?

    "," Elizabeth said that Sophia is not a knight, so Sophia must be a knave since she always lies.
     Since Sophia is a knave, her statement that Victoria is a knave is false, so Victoria must be a knight, as knights tell the truth.

If Aiden is a knave, then his statement must be a lie, which means that Aiden is not a knight and Sofia is not a knave. Therefore, Sofia is a knight. Sofia said that Chloe is not a knight, so Chloe is a knave. Since Chloe is a knave, what she said must be a lie, which means Aiden is a knight.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 4 inhabitants: Victoria, Charlotte, Aiden, and Daniel. Victoria asserted: ""Charlotte is a knight or Daniel is a knight"". ""Aiden is a knight if and only if Aiden is a knave,"" Charlotte claimed.

    Assistant: <think>
    "," Charlotte said that Aiden is a knight if and only if Aiden is a knave, but a statement is either true or false. Therefore, Charlotte must be a knave, and Aiden must be a knave.

As Evelyn put it, ""Mia is a knave if and only if Evelyn is a knight"". William remarked, ""Mia is a knave"". ""Evelyn is a knight if and only if Mia is a knight,"" Mia mentioned. So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Evelyn said that ""Mia is a knave if and only if Evelyn is a knight."" This can be written as: If Evelyn is a knight, then Mia is a knave. If Evelyn is a knave, then Mia is a knight.
     Since Evelyn stated this about herself, Evelyn is a knight. Therefore, Mia is a knave.
     William said, ""Mia is a knave,"" so William is a knight.
     Mia said, ""Evelyn is a knight if and only if Mia is a knight."" This can be written as: If Mia is a knight, then Evelyn is a knight. If Mia is a knave, then Evelyn is a knave.
     Since we determined that Mia is a knave, this statement is true because it would be true if both parts were switched (If Mia is a knave, then Evelyn is a knave). Therefore, Mia is a knave, and her statement is consistent with her being a knave.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 3 inhabitants: Isabella, James, and Lily. Isabella told you that Lily is a knave and Lily is a knight. As James put it, ""Lily is a knave and Lily is a knight"". According to Lily, ""James is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Isabella said that Lily is a knave and Lily is a knight, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Isabella must be a knave.
     Since Lily said that James is a knight, and Isabella, who Isabella said is a knave, is also a knave, then Lily must be a knight.
     Finally, since James said that Lily is a knave and Lily is a knight, which is a contradiction, then James must be a knave.

    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 3 inhabitants: Henry, Sofia, and Oliver. Henry said that Oliver is a knave if and only if Oliver is a knight. Sofia remarked, ""Oliver is not a knight"". Oliver remarked, ""Henry is a knight"". So who is a knight and who is a knave?
    Assistant: <think>
    "," Henry said that Oliver is a knave if and only if Oliver is a knight, so if Henry is a knight, then Oliver is a knave. If Henry is a knave, then Oliver is a knight.
     Sofia remarked that Oliver is not a knight, so Sofia is telling the truth because that makes Oliver a knave, and knaves lie.
     Since Sofia is a knight, Henry's statement that Oliver is a knave if and only if Oliver is a knight must be false, so Henry must be a knave and Oliver must be a knight.
